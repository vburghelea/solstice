# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the current user authentication system to include comprehensive profile data required for membership management, team roster functionality, and age verification. Currently, the system only captures basic user information (name, email) during signup, but many downstream features require additional profile fields such as privacy preferences.

The user profile extension will serve as the foundation for the member onboarding flow, membership purchase validation, and team management features that follow in the development roadmap.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to provide comprehensive profile information during registration, so that I can participate in memberships, teams, and events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes signup THEN the system SHALL capture additional profile fields including gender, pronouns, and privacy settings
2. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL maintain an audit trail with timestamps and version tracking
3. IF a user provides privacy settings THEN the system SHALL store these preferences in a structured JSONB format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want profile data to be stored with proper data integrity and security measures, so that sensitive user information is protected and compliant with privacy regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN profile data is stored THEN the system SHALL use appropriate database constraints and indexes for performance
2. WHEN sensitive data is handled THEN the system SHALL implement soft-delete patterns to prevent data loss
3. WHEN profile updates occur THEN the system SHALL track modification timestamps and maintain data versioning

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want server functions for profile management, so that I can build user interfaces and integrate profile data with other system features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN profile server functions are implemented THEN the system SHALL provide query functions for retrieving user profiles
2. WHEN profile mutations are needed THEN the system SHALL provide server functions for creating and updating profile data
3. WHEN profile data is accessed THEN the system SHALL include proper TypeScript typing and Zod validation schemas
4. IF profile operations fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages and maintain data consistency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage for profile functionality, so that profile features work reliably and regressions are caught early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN profile server functions are implemented THEN the system SHALL include unit tests covering all query and mutation operations
2. WHEN profile validation is implemented THEN the system SHALL include tests for all validation scenarios including edge cases
3. WHEN database schema changes are made THEN the system SHALL include migration tests to ensure data integrity
4. IF profile operations involve error handling THEN the system SHALL include tests for error scenarios and recovery

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want my profile to indicate completion status, so that the system can guide me through required onboarding steps before accessing advanced features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's profile is evaluated THEN the system SHALL determine if required fields are complete
2. WHEN profile completion status changes THEN the system SHALL update the user record accordingly
3. WHEN downstream features check profile status THEN the system SHALL provide a reliable indicator of profile completeness
4. IF required profile fields are missing THEN the system SHALL identify which specific fields need completion
