# Square Integration Fix Summary

## ✅ Callback Now Finalizes Memberships

Square sandbox redirects were terminating with the payment session stuck in `completed` status and
no membership created. The callback endpoint now:

1. Verifies the payment with Square and records the transaction id
2. Loads membership + user context and guards for amount / currency drift
3. Finalizes the purchase atomically (create membership, link session, stamp metadata)
4. Sends a receipt email when a new membership is issued
5. Redirects back to `/dashboard/membership` with stable query params including `payment_id`

## Key Changes

- `src/routes/api/payments/square/callback.ts`
  - Hardened the handler (session lookup, cancellation handling, failure metadata)
  - Performs Square payment verification and error surfaces to the user
  - Uses the new `finalizeMembershipForSession` helper to activate memberships
  - Sends the membership receipt email once per successful activation

- `src/features/membership/membership.finalize.ts`
  - Shared helper that encapsulates the idempotent membership creation logic
  - Updates both the membership record and the payment session within one transaction

- `src/features/membership/membership.mutations.ts`
  - Reuses the helper so portal confirms and the callback follow the exact same success path
  - Avoids duplicate customer emails when the membership already exists

## Current Status

- ✅ Square sandbox checkout + callback data persists in `membership_payment_sessions`
- ✅ Membership creation + receipt email triggered by server-side callback
- ✅ Client-side confirm mutation remains compatible (no duplicate work)

> NOTE: The hosted Netlify site still runs the previous build, so production tests must run after
> deploying these changes.

## Suggested Follow-Up

- Deploy to Netlify and re-test the full flow using Square sandbox.
- Confirm the redirected membership page now sees `success=true` (no extra quoting) and shows an
  active membership.
