# Square Integration Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-09-19

## ✅ Test Status: Production Verified

The Netlify deployment dated 2025‑09‑19 now completes the full Square sandbox flow end‑to‑end.

## Test Summary (Production)

- **Site**: https://snazzy-twilight-39e1e9.netlify.app
- **Checkout ID**: `LUJO45SIIB655EEP`
- **Payment ID**: `Hd3J4zVKfMdLXNXalzSO94b6upOZY`
- **Metadata**: redirect received `membership_id=qibe9dnckx7juwbn4pzl7vj3`
- **Result**: Dashboard shows “Active Membership” and “Current Plan” is disabled; receipt email sent
  once.

## Validation Steps

1. Triggered sandbox payment via Square testing panel (`Test Payment` button)
2. Callback redirected to `/dashboard/membership?success=true&payment_id=...&session=...`
3. Verified membership session stored with `status=completed`, linked membership id, payment id
4. Confirmed UI reflects active membership state after redirect

## Local Safeguards

- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm check-types`
- Manual callback simulation to ensure URL parsing still works when query values are JSON encoded

## Test Environment

- **Square Environment**: Sandbox
- **Square Location ID**: LVDXQH3JBZ5EK
- **Database**: Neon (same instance queried during validation)
