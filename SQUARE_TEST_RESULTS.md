# Square Integration Test Results

## Test Date: 2025-09-19

## ⚠️ Test Status: Pending Deployment

The callback + membership activation flow now passes locally, but the hosted Netlify build has not
been updated yet. Live tests still reflect the pre-fix behaviour (payment session completes without
activating the membership).

## Local Validation

- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm check-types`
- Manual callback simulation against the updated code confirms that:
  - Square payment verification succeeds and writes `square_payment_id`
  - `finalizeMembershipForSession` creates the membership + links the payment session
  - The callback redirects with `success=true&payment_id=<id>&session=<checkout>`

## Remote Sandbox Check (current production build)

- Site: https://snazzy-twilight-39e1e9.netlify.app
- Membership: Annual Player Membership 2025 ($45.00 CAD)
- Checkout + Square payment succeed (order id `HfMIffMHq40kCXQZph5dStNTXd4F`)
- Callback currently returns with `success="true"` (quoted) and the membership remains inactive
  because the site is still running the old build.

## Next Steps Once Deployed

1. Re-run the purchase flow on Netlify.
2. Confirm the redirect URL looks like
   `...?success=true&payment_id=...&session=...&type=annual-player-2025`.
3. Verify the dashboard shows "Active Membership" and the receipt email is delivered once.
4. Confirm `membership_payment_sessions.metadata` now contains `membershipId`.

## Test Environment

- **Square Environment**: Sandbox
- **Square Location ID**: LVDXQH3JBZ5EK
- **Database**: Neon (same instance queried during validation)
