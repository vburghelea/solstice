# Changes Made (2026-01-07)

## Summary

Added security scanning workflows (CodeQL, ZAP baseline DAST, dependency review,
optional Snyk) and documented the Snyk secret. Committed and pushed all staged
changes to `main` as requested.

## New and Updated CI Workflows

- Added CodeQL scanning workflow: `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`.
- Added ZAP baseline DAST workflow: `.github/workflows/zap-baseline.yml`.
- Added dependency review workflow: `.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml`.
- Added optional Snyk workflow (runs only if `SNYK_TOKEN` is set):
  `.github/workflows/snyk.yml`.
- Added ZAP baseline rules config: `.zap/zap-baseline.conf`.
- Documented `SNYK_TOKEN` in `.github/SECRETS.md`.

## Commit + Push

- Commit: `73dad2b` ("Add security scanning workflows and update SIN RFP docs").
- Branch: `main`.
- Pushed to: `origin`.

## Notes

- ZAP runs against a local dev server and stores artifacts in the workflow
  run (HTML/Markdown/JSON reports).
- Snyk workflow is guarded with `if: secrets.SNYK_TOKEN != ''` so it is
  inactive until a token is configured.
