# Deployment Investigation: Event Registration Page

## ✅ RESOLVED - September 21, 2025

All deployment issues have been successfully resolved. The event registration page at https://snazzy-twilight-39e1e9.netlify.app/events/e2e-open-showcase/register is now fully functional.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Registration Route Not Rendering (FIXED)

**Problem**: The `/events/{slug}/register` route showed event detail content instead of the registration form.

**Root Cause**: TanStack Router requires parent routes to have an `<Outlet />` component for child routes to render properly.

**Solution**:

- Created layout route at `/events/$slug.tsx` with `<Outlet />` component
- Moved event detail page to index route `/events/$slug.index.tsx`
- This allows child routes like `/events/$slug/register` to render correctly

### 2. SSR Cache Issue (FIXED)

**Problem**: Netlify served stale server-rendered HTML despite having updated client bundles.

**Solution**: Manual deployment using `netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist` to bypass Netlify's build cache.

### 3. UI/UX Issues (FIXED)

- Removed duplicate "Register" button from event cards
- Fixed button width overflow
- Added loading states to prevent registration status flickering

### 4. CSP Violations (FIXED)

Added required hashes to `netlify/edge-functions/security-headers.ts`:

- `sha256-gHUVPg/ygmuHop+u65qJwyip1pg0/k2Ch2Va8wmwlgY=`

## Current Status

✅ **Event Detail Page**: `/events/e2e-open-showcase` - Working correctly
✅ **Registration Page**: `/events/e2e-open-showcase/register` - Fully functional
✅ **Payment Options**: Both Square and e-transfer options available (when enabled)
✅ **Loading States**: No flickering or UI issues

## Deployment Commands

### Standard Deploy

```bash
git push  # Triggers Netlify auto-deploy
```

### Force Fresh Deploy (if cache issues occur)

```bash
pnpm build
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

## Test Accounts

- `test@example.com` / `testpassword123` - Already registered for E2E Open Showcase
- `teamcreator@example.com` / `testpassword123` - Not registered (use for testing)

## Key Learnings

1. **TanStack Router Requirements**: Parent routes must have `<Outlet />` for child routes to render
2. **Netlify Cache Issues**: Can be bypassed with manual CLI deployment
3. **CSP Hashes**: Must be added proactively when inline scripts are detected

## Original Investigation Notes

The original issue involved the client bundle being updated correctly but the server-rendered HTML remaining stale. The JS asset at `/_slug.register-DHkfY7sG.js` contained the new registration form code, but the SSR output wasn't being refreshed by Netlify's build process.

Evidence gathered:

- Client bundle contained `Register for {event.name}` and payment radio markup
- Server HTML only showed old summary view
- No hydration occurred to replace the stale HTML
- CSP warnings were resolved after adding hashes

The solution involved both fixing the routing structure and forcing a fresh deployment to bypass cache issues.
