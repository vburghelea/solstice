## Connections-only Visibility

Some lists and actions are gated by social relationships to reduce unwanted interactions:

- Games and Campaigns marked `protected` are presented as ‚ÄúConnections-only‚Äù. They are visible in lists and eligible for ‚Äúapply‚Äù only when the viewer is connected to the organizer (either follow direction) and neither side has blocked the other.
- Direct navigation to a protected item still honors block rules; if blocked, the UI renders a neutral restriction banner without leaking private state.
- Admin/mod tooling may bypass in moderation contexts but should avoid leaking state on user-facing surfaces.

Developer notes:

- Back-end queries enforce ‚Äúconnections-only‚Äù by requiring a follower/followed-by relation and absence of blocks.
- Client surfaces should hide or disable ‚ÄúApply‚Äù when the viewer and organizer are blocked either way.
