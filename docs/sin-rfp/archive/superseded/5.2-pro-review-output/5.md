## 1. Progress Summary

### What the docs _collectively_ imply

Across the backlog tracker, catch-up context, route-tree plan, and technical-debt notes, the story is:

- **Phase 0 (docs)**: basically complete _as documents_.
- **Phase 1–4 (features + admin UI)**: a lot is implemented and wired, but there are **material gaps in production readiness** (infra configuration, verification evidence, E2E coverage) and **there are at least some serious access-control risks documented** (depending on whether the Feb 2025 findings were fully fixed).

### My completion estimate (based on docs only)

Because I cannot see the actual repository code state here (only documentation), the best I can do is an “evidence-weighted” estimate:

- **Feature implementation (what’s built in code, per claims): ~80–90%**
  Forms, reporting workflows, privacy/DSAR, audit, notifications, basic analytics/export appear substantially implemented.
- **Security hardening closure (are there no high-risk authZ gaps?): ~60–80%**
  The _route-tree-implementation-review.md_ lists several “High” authZ issues. The backlog later claims “Issues 01–11” patched. Those two documents are not reconciled, so confidence is reduced.
- **Production readiness / RFP-defensible evidence: ~55–70%**
  Because key “evidence” items are still marked as not executed or only templated (backup restore tests), and infra items still show as pending (SES verification, secrets, queue deployment status).

If you want a single blended number: **~65–75% “SIN-ready”**. That’s lower than the backlog’s stated **~85%** mainly because:

- “✅ Complete” is being used even where **infra configuration + verification + testing** are explicitly still pending.
- Some **security findings are unresolved or at least not documented as resolved**.

## 2. Gaps Found

Below are requirement-level gaps (from **SIN-REQUIREMENTS.md**) that are either **not tracked**, **only partially addressed**, or **missing evidence** in the provided docs.

### Training & Onboarding (TO-AGG-001/2/3) — not tracked

These requirements appear **absent from the backlog progress tracker** and not mentioned as implemented:

- **TO-AGG-001 Template Support & Integration**
  Requires a _centralized templates tab_ and contextual template access from each data entry item. Not surfaced in the Phase 0–4 tracker.
- **TO-AGG-002 Guided Learning & Walkthroughs**
  Onboarding/data upload tutorials not tracked as features.
- **TO-AGG-003 Reference Materials & Support (FAQ, guides)**
  No evidence of an in-app guides/FAQ system.

**Impact:** even with strong core workflows, adoption and sector onboarding (PSO/club staff) will be rough, and this is explicitly in the RFP requirements.

### UI-AGG-006 Support inquiries & feedback — not tracked

- **UI-AGG-006 User Support & Feedback Mechanism** (submit inquiries/feedback + admin managed responses) does not appear in Phase 0–4 delivery or technical debt.
  This is a real product gap, not “nice to have,” per requirements.

### Data governance discoverability (DM-AGG-003) — partially covered

- RBAC and org scoping are covered, but the requirement also calls for **data cataloging and indexing capabilities for discoverability**.
  Nothing in these docs indicates a catalog/index/search layer beyond per-screen filtering.

### Continuous data quality monitoring (DM-AGG-004) — partial

Forms validation and file validation exist, but DM-AGG-004 calls for **continuous monitoring** with automated checks. I see validation at submission time, but not an ongoing “quality monitor” job/dashboard.

### Bulk import lane 2 infrastructure (DM-AGG-006) — explicitly partial

- The backlog tracker says **Bulk Import & Data Migration is 🟡 Partial (80%)** and calls out:
  **“Missing: ECS task definition wiring.”**
  So the _core requirement for 20M+ rows_ is not fully production wired.

### Backups / DR evidence (DM-AGG-005) — missing execution evidence

Phase 0 includes DR plan + retention policy, but:

- **Backup restore test results are only a template** (explicitly called out in backlog checklist as still needed).
- Audit retention docs talk about Glacier + Object Lock, while technical debt indicates archival/WORM storage is still follow-up work.

### Analytics depth (RP-AGG-005) — likely partial depending on interpretation

RP-AGG-005 explicitly mentions **ad-hoc charts/pivots**. Current docs emphasize:

- report builder (filters/columns) + exports
  But not clearly pivot/chart-building for non-technical users. If “exports + saved filters” is acceptable as “self-service analytics” for MVP, then you’re OK. If the RFP evaluator expects actual pivot/chart UI, that’s a gap.

---

## 3. Documentation Issues

These are **internal inconsistencies**, missing updates, or places where “complete” isn’t aligned with documented remaining work.

### A) Backlog document contains outdated “To Build” mappings

In **SIN-IMPLEMENTATION-BACKLOG-V2.md**:

- The “Security Controls Mapped to SIN Requirements” table still shows many items as **“To Build”** even though later sections + progress tracker mark them implemented (MFA, lockout, privacy, audit).
  This is confusing to evaluators and to engineers.

**Fix:** Update that mapping table to reflect current status and link to evidence files/tests.

### B) “✅ Complete” used while infra/secrets are still pending

**SIN-IMPLEMENTATION-TECHNICAL-DEBT.md** says “Deployed to dev” and marks some items “Implemented,” but later checklist still has:

- secrets not configured
- SES not verified
- queue creation/deploy pending
- manual testing not done
- E2E tests incomplete (audit/security access tests still TODO)

**Fix:** adopt a stronger Definition of Done in the backlog tracker:

- ✅ Complete = code + tests + deployed infra + basic verification evidence.

### C) Route-tree review doc is “in progress” and not reconciled with Dec 2025 patch claims

**route-tree-implementation-review.md** (Feb 2025) lists multiple **High** findings.
**SIN-IMPLEMENTATION-BACKLOG-V2.md** (Dec 2025) claims security patches were applied.

But the review doc:

- doesn’t list which findings were fixed
- doesn’t link to PRs/commits
- doesn’t include “verification steps / tests added”

**Fix:** Add a “Status” column per finding (Open / Fixed / Verified) + reference.

### D) Phase 0 docs promise controls that technical debt says are still future work

Examples:

- Backup/DR and audit retention mention Glacier/Object Lock archival.
- Technical debt explicitly lists implementing proper WORM/Glacier archival as follow-up.

This isn’t wrong as a _target architecture_, but it’s a documentation risk if you present Phase 0 docs as “implemented controls” vs “planned controls.”

**Fix:** Add “Implementation Status” callouts in Phase 0 docs:

- “Implemented now” vs “Planned for production hardening” with dates/phases.

### E) Progress tracker is missing a requirements coverage matrix

There is no single matrix that maps each **Requirement ID** (DM/RP/SEC/TO/UI) to:

- implementation module(s)
- tests
- docs evidence
- status

Right now it’s very feature-centric, not requirement-centric.

## 4. Security Findings

### 4.1 What’s already in `route-tree-implementation-review.md` (and why it matters)

The review doc’s “High” findings are serious classes of issues:

- **Cross-org data exposure / tampering** risks (saved reports scoping, reporting queries unauthenticated)
- **Privilege escalation** risks (admin-only org/privacy/notification actions missing admin enforcement)
- **Unauthenticated enumeration** risks (reporting cycles/tasks/submissions, saved reports listing)

Even if these were fixed later, they are critical enough that they should have:

- regression tests
- a documented closure trail
- explicit “no unauthenticated access” guarantees in server functions

### 4.2 Security/compliance issues _not_ called out in the route-tree review doc (but visible in other docs)

These aren’t necessarily “bugs,” but they are security/compliance gaps or risks that should be tracked:

1. **Export abuse controls**
   - Technical debt explicitly notes **no rate limiting on exports** (beyond MFA/step-up).
     That’s a data exfiltration risk category and should be tracked as a security hardening item.

2. **Email sender/domain hygiene**
   - Using a personal gmail FROM address is called out as debt.
     Deliverability + anti-spoofing (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) matters, and in compliance reviews this often gets questioned.

3. **Data residency exceptions inventory**
   - Data residency doc lists optional processors with “Global/TBD.”
     You should explicitly track: “If OAuth enabled” / “If Square enabled” → DPA + residency risk acceptance.

4. **Backup/DR evidence gap**
   - Missing executed restore test results is an operational security risk (availability + recoverability).
     This should be tracked as a release gate, not just a template.

5. **“Complete” without E2E authZ coverage**
   - Technical debt lists missing E2E tests for audit/security endpoint authorization.
     Given the sensitivity of audit/security data, lack of automated access tests is a security regression risk.

### 4.3 Is the security findings document “complete”?

No. It states “Findings (Partial)” and the scope shows it’s being appended. Also, it focuses on specific modules and misses broader classes of risks such as:

- CSRF strategy (if applicable) and cookie security verification
- consistent session enforcement patterns across _all_ server functions
- rate limiting across authentication & export endpoints
- file upload malware scanning policy (beyond MIME/size validation)
- header-based org context misuse across clients (admin pages)

That doesn’t mean those are broken; it means they are **not covered by the review document**, so the document is incomplete as an audit artifact.

---

## 5. Recommendations

### Priority 0 — Reconcile the truth across documents (fast, high leverage)

- Add a **single source of truth** for implementation status:
  - For each “High” finding in `route-tree-implementation-review.md`, add:
    - Status: Open / Fixed / Verified
    - Link to the patch/PR
    - Test coverage added (unit/e2e)

- Update the backlog tracker “Overall progress” after this reconciliation.

This prevents a situation where the backlog says “85% done” while the security review still reads as “high-risk open issues.”

### Priority 1 — Close the access-control classes of bugs with a systematic sweep

Regardless of whether the Feb 2025 issues are fixed, the pattern risk is clear:

- inconsistent use of **require session**
- inconsistent use of **require admin**
- inconsistent **org scoping**

Action:

- Do a **module-by-module authZ audit checklist** for every server fn:
  - Session required? (yes unless explicitly public)
  - Tenant feature gate present?
  - Org scoping enforced by default?
  - Admin-only actions require global admin?
  - Delegated access handled where intended?

- Add E2E tests for the “can’t access” cases (audit/security/reporting/reports/org admin).

### Priority 2 — Fix the “production readiness” blockers

These are release gating items implied by your own docs:

- **ECS batch worker wiring** for Lane 2 imports (DM-AGG-006)
- **SES domain verification + SPF/DKIM/DMARC**
- **SQS + DLQ + alarms** verified in deployed environment
- **Backup restore drill executed** + fill the appendix table with results
- **Document archival strategy** aligned with what Phase 0 docs promise

### Priority 3 — Track missing RFP requirements explicitly as Phase 5 backlog

Even if you decide they’re MVP-deferred, you should track them so requirements coverage is defensible:

- TO-AGG-001 templates hub + contextual templates
- TO-AGG-002 walkthroughs
- TO-AGG-003 guides/FAQ
- UI-AGG-006 support/feedback intake + admin response workflow
- DM-AGG-003 data catalog/indexing (even a minimal metadata/search layer)

### Priority 4 — Tighten the documentation so it’s evaluator-ready

- Add a **Requirements Coverage Matrix** in the backlog doc:
  - Req ID → module(s) → status → evidence link(s) → tests

- Add “Implementation Status” callouts in Phase 0 docs:
  - “Implemented now” vs “Planned”

- Ensure no sections still read like “pre-implementation baseline” (e.g., “To Build” tables).

---

If you want the single most actionable next step: **turn the route-tree review findings into a tracked closure list (with tests), then update the backlog progress numbers to match that reality.** That one move will make the progress tracker trustworthy and will surface what’s truly left for Phase 0–4 readiness vs Phase 5+ enhancements.
