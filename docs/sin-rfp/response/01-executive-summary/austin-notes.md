- **Tone**: Formal, following example RFP style
- **Structure**: Welcome statement → Philosophy → Key Highlights → Proposed Solution

## Key Decisions

### 1. Core Message (THE One Thing)

**De-risked delivery via working prototype that shows level of care.**

The prototype is the primary differentiator. Lead with it prominently in the first paragraph.

### 2. Company Name

**Austin Wallace Tech** - official company name for submission.

### 3. Welcome Statement

Follow example format:

> "Austin Wallace Tech is pleased to respond to viaSport's Strength in Numbers RFP..."

| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **De-risked Delivery**   | Working prototype, 90% built, load-tested at 20M rows    |
| **Domain Expertise**     | Sports data background (IQA, Devils, Clio), UBC BSc      |
| **Canadian & Compliant** | AWS ca-central-1, PIPEDA-aligned, 7-year audit retention |
| **Modern Architecture**  | Serverless, native BI platform, form builder             |

| Response time    | sub-250ms (p95)           |
| Requirements met | 21/25 in prototype        |
| Timeline         | ~18 weeks to full rollout |

**Note**: Do NOT include pricing in executive summary.

### 6. "Our Proposed Solution" Section

Include BOTH:

- High-level architecture overview (AWS services, PostgreSQL, serverless)
- What viaSport gets (BI platform, form builder, migration tooling, training)

### 7. Team Presentation

Assume team is finalized by submission:

- Austin Wallace - Project Lead / Data Engineer
- Will Siddal - Full Stack Developer
- Security Expert - (name TBD but role filled)
- UX Designer - (name TBD but role filled)

### 8. Personal Story

Use ONLY in context of professional and domain knowledge:

- Chair of IQA (30+ national governing bodies)
- UBC BSc in Analytical Sports Management
- New Jersey Devils data platform (10M rows/game)
- Clio data engineering (Databricks, $1M+ value)

Do NOT emphasize:

- Quadball/quidditch passion angle
- Side project framing
- Hobby/personal interest narrative

### 9. What NOT to Mention

- Partial requirements (4 of 25) - save for detailed sections
- Specific pricing - covered in Cost & Value section
- Team members still being recruited - assume finalized

### 10. Call to Action

Follow example RFP approach:

- Express interest in presentation/demo opportunity
- Offer to discuss further
- Professional close

## Source Documents Referenced

- Example RFP: `/docs/sin-rfp/source/DO-NOT-COMMIT-CONFIDENTIAL-example-rfp-real.txt`
- viaSport RFP: `/docs/sin-rfp/source/VIASPORT-PROVIDED-viasport-sin-rfp.md`
- System Requirements: `/docs/sin-rfp/source/VIASPORT-PROVIDED-system-requirements-addendum.md`

## Key Differentiators to Weave Throughout

1. **Working prototype** - 90% built, load tested, purpose-built for viaSport
2. **Principal-led delivery** - the person who built it is delivering it
3. **Unique domain expertise** - sports data management at enterprise scale
4. **Native BI platform** - built for governance, not bolted on
5. **Canadian data residency** - all data stays in ca-central-1
6. **Modern stack** - serverless, auto-scaling, low operational burden

## Framing Philosophy

From austin-notes (root):

> "DON'T say: 'I had a hobby project that happened to fit'"
> "DO say: 'When I saw this RFP, I knew I was uniquely qualified, so I built a working prototype to prove it'"

The prototype was PURPOSE-BUILT for viaSport's requirements. It demonstrates:

- Technical capability
- Domain understanding
- Commitment to the project
- Risk reduction for viaSport
