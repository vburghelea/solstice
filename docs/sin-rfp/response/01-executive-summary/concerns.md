# Concerns / Missing Inputs

- No pricing model, cost breakdown, or recurring support costs found; budget summary
  is still TBD. (docs/sin-rfp/response/06-cost-value/final.md)
- Company profile, staffing, locations, sector experience, and case studies are
  not present; required for vendor fit and capabilities sections. (docs/sin-rfp/response/02-vendor-fit/final.md, docs/sin-rfp/response/05-capabilities-experience/final.md)
- No metrics or outcomes from similar implementations are documented for the
  executive summary evidence targets. (docs/sin-rfp/response/01-executive-summary/notes.md)
- Executive summary evidence folder is empty; no architecture diagram export or
  supporting visuals yet. (docs/sin-rfp/response/01-executive-summary/evidence/)
- Requirements status conflicts between coverage matrix (some "Implemented") and
  verification report (mostly "Partial"); needs reconciliation before claims.
  (docs/sin-rfp/requirements/requirements-coverage-matrix.md, docs/sin-rfp/review-plans/requirements-verification-report-2025-12-28.md)
- Verification report notes missing seeded data and partial validation of several
  workflows; executive summary claims must mark these as planned/in progress.
  (docs/sin-rfp/review-plans/requirements-verification-report-2025-12-28.md)
- Migration strategy uses synthetic placeholders pending real BCAR/BCSI exports;
  field mappings and row counts need confirmed source data. (docs/sin-rfp/phase-0/migration-strategy.md)
- Data residency, backup/DR, and audit retention docs note pending evidence
  (SES enforcement, Glacier/Object Lock, DR drill results); avoid "fully complete"
  claims until verified. (docs/sin-rfp/phase-0/data-residency.md, docs/sin-rfp/phase-0/backup-dr-plan.md, docs/sin-rfp/phase-0/audit-retention-policy.md)
- Delivery schedule only has phase ranges (17-24 weeks) without calendar dates,
  staffing assumptions, or dependencies. (docs/sin-rfp/phase-0/phased-delivery-plan.md)
