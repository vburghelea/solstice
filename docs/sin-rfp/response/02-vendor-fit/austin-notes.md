## Narrative Framing

### Why Austin Wallace Tech exists

"Incorporated specifically to serve viaSport because I'm passionate about sports data and believe I can deliver exceptional results. This isn't a side project for a big consultancy - it's my primary focus."

### Why small/new is a strength

- **Principal-led**: Direct access to the person who built the platform
- **No hand-offs**: Same team from prototype through production
- **Agile**: No bureaucracy, fast decisions
- **Proven at scale**: Austin's background shows enterprise-grade delivery (Devils, Clio, Teck)

### The sports angle (USE THIS)

- Don't hide the quadball background - it shows genuine passion
- Chair of IQA = executive leadership of international sports organization
- UBC degree literally called "Analytical Sports Management"
- Built Qdrill for real users (Team Canada)
- This isn't a vendor who "also does sports" - this is someone who LIVES sports data

### Framing the prototype (IMPORTANT)

- **DON'T say**: "I had a hobby project that happened to fit"
- **DO say**: "When I saw this RFP, I knew I was uniquely qualified, so I built a working prototype to prove it"
- Solstice was PURPOSE-BUILT for viaSport's requirements, not a coincidence
- The sports background explains WHY Austin could build it so fast - domain expertise
- Qdrill (separate project) = proof of shipping real products athletes use
- Solstice = deliberate investment to de-risk viaSport's decision
