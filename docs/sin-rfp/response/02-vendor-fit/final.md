## Proposed Solution Statement

Austin Wallace Tech proposes the Solstice platform: a purpose-built information management system designed specifically for viaSport's Strength in Numbers requirements.

### Key Differentiators

**1. Working Prototype, Not a Proposal**

A functional prototype already exists, meeting all 25 system requirements as documented in the System Requirements Addendum. This prototype has been load-tested with 20.1 million rows of data, achieving sub-250 millisecond response times with zero server errors. viaSport can evaluate a working system, not a proposal document.

**2. Principal-Led Delivery**

The architect and sole developer of the prototype will lead delivery. This eliminates the risk of knowledge transfer failures between sales, design, and implementation teams. viaSport will work directly with the person who understands the system most deeply.

**3. Domain Expertise in Sport Data**

Austin Wallace's background combines enterprise data engineering (Devils, Clio, Teck) with executive leadership in amateur sport governance (IQA Chair, 30+ national governing bodies). His UBC degree in Analytical Sports Management was designed specifically for this intersection. This is not a vendor who "also does sports." This is a team that understands sport sector data challenges from firsthand experience.

**4. British Columbia Based**

All team members are based in British Columbia. The company understands the local context, regulatory environment, and sport sector landscape.

**5. Canadian Data Residency**

All data is hosted exclusively in AWS ca-central-1 (Montreal), ensuring compliance with Canadian privacy statutes including PIPEDA. No data leaves Canadian jurisdiction.

### Benefits to viaSport

- **Reduced Risk:** Evaluate a working system before committing, not a vendor's promises.
- **Accelerated Timeline:** 18 weeks to full rollout because the platform already exists.
- **Direct Accountability:** Principal-led delivery with no organizational layers between viaSport and the technical team.
- **Sector Understanding:** A team that has led amateur sport organizations, not just built software for them.
- **Long-term Sustainability:** Modern architecture (serverless, infrastructure as code) minimizes ongoing operational burden.
