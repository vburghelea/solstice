## Continuity of Services

Continuity is supported by the architecture and delivery model:

- **Infrastructure as Code:** All AWS resources are defined in SST and version controlled.
- **Operational Runbooks:** Deployment and recovery procedures are documented and maintained.
- **Automated Testing:** CI tests provide regression coverage for core workflows.
- **Principal Accountability:** Austin Wallace remains the constant delivery lead through rollout.

If a team member changes, the codebase, infrastructure definitions, and operational documentation enable efficient transition.

## Proposed Solution Statement

Austin Wallace Tech proposes the Solstice platform, a purpose-built information management system aligned to the Strength in Numbers requirements.

### Key Differentiators

**1. Working Prototype, Not a Proposal**

A functional prototype already exists and is available for evaluation. It addresses the majority of System Requirements Addendum items today and has been load-tested at production scale with 20.1 million rows.

**2. Principal-Led Delivery**

The architect and primary developer of the prototype will lead delivery. This reduces knowledge transfer risk and provides direct accountability.

**3. Domain Expertise in Sport Data**

Austin Wallace combines enterprise data engineering experience with leadership in amateur sport governance. This team understands sport sector reporting and data governance from firsthand experience.

**4. British Columbia Based**

The core team is based in British Columbia and remaining roles are expected to be BC based.

**5. Canadian Data Residency**

All data is hosted in AWS ca-central-1 (Canada). No data leaves Canadian jurisdiction.

### Benefits to viaSport

- **Reduced Risk:** Evaluate a working system before committing.
- **Accelerated Timeline:** 18 weeks to rollout because the platform exists today.
- **Direct Accountability:** Principal-led delivery with no organizational layers.
- **Sector Understanding:** Experience leading amateur sport organizations, not just building software.
- **Sustainability:** Serverless architecture and infrastructure as code reduce operating overhead.
