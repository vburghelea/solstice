# Update Notes - Reporting (RP-AGG)

## 2026-01-04 13:46 PST

- RP-AGG-002: Reporting metadata fields (agreement/NCCP/fiscal/contact) are implemented and editable in the reporting portal, so the status can move from Partial to Comply; evidence: `src/features/reporting/reporting.schemas.ts`, `src/features/reporting/reporting.mutations.ts`, `src/routes/dashboard/sin/reporting.tsx`, `src/db/schema/organizations.schema.ts`.
- RP-AGG-002: Delegated access rights are implemented via delegated access records, org admin UI, and access resolution, so cite them explicitly in the response; evidence: `src/db/schema/organizations.schema.ts`, `src/features/organizations/organizations.mutations.ts`, `src/features/organizations/organizations.queries.ts`, `src/features/organizations/components/organization-admin-panel.tsx`, `src/features/organizations/organizations.access.ts`.
- RP-AGG-001: Server-side validation enforces required fields and file constraints but does not validate email/phone/date formats unless custom validation rules are configured; clarify this scope vs. "valid contact info" claims; evidence: `src/features/forms/forms.schemas.ts`, `src/features/forms/forms.utils.ts`, `src/features/forms/forms.mutations.ts`, `src/components/form-fields/ValidatedDatePicker.tsx`, `src/components/form-fields/ValidatedPhoneInput.tsx`.
- RP-AGG-003: Reminder cadence defaults to 14/7/3/1 days and is configurable per task via reminderConfig, with scheduled notifications processed by cron; mention the extra 14-day default and configurability; evidence: `src/features/reporting/reporting.mutations.ts`, `src/lib/notifications/scheduler.ts`, `src/cron/process-notifications.ts`, `src/db/schema/notifications.schema.ts`.
- RP-AGG-005: JSON export is available in the BI pivot export flow, but the report builder exports only CSV/XLSX; update language to reflect both paths; evidence: `src/features/bi/bi.mutations.ts`, `src/features/bi/bi.schemas.ts`, `src/features/bi/components/pivot-builder/PivotBuilder.tsx`, `src/features/reports/reports.schemas.ts`, `src/features/reports/components/report-builder-shell.tsx`.
- RP-AGG-004: File handling is limited to single-file uploads (arrays rejected and maxFiles forced to 1), so call out the single-file assumption; evidence: `src/features/forms/forms.utils.ts`, `src/features/forms/forms.mutations.ts`, `src/features/forms/components/form-builder-shell.tsx`.
