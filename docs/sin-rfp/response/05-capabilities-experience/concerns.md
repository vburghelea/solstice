# Concerns and Missing Inputs

- No company profile data in repo (incorporation date, size, locations, org
  structure) to substantiate experience claims.
- Partners/subcontractors are not identified anywhere; confirm if none, or
  provide names, roles, oversight, and continuity plan.
- Case study specifics are missing (timeline, scale, user counts, uptime,
  adoption metrics, impact metrics, reference contacts, permission to name).
- Quadball Canada appears as a tenant/client but the repo does not confirm
  production status or permission to use as a public reference.
- viaSport SIN implementation is documented but verification shows partial
  compliance and missing integrations; avoid overstating "success" without
  qualification. Evidence: docs/sin-rfp/review-plans/requirements-verification-report-2025-12-28.md.
- No explicit responsible AI policy; if AI is claimed, provide governance
  guidance or state AI is not used today.
- External API strategy is unclear; requirements note optional integrations but
  no public API documentation or partner auth model is defined.
- The section evidence folder is empty; if we need evidence artifacts, add or
  link to docs/sin-rfp/review-plans/evidence/ screenshots.
