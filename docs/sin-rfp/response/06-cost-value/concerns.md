# Cost and Value Concerns / Missing Inputs

- No pricing model, rate card, or total budget numbers exist in repo; section cannot be completed without confirmed pricing.
- No documented change management / change order process to cite.
- Evidence folder is empty; no pricing worksheets for Appendix H and no optional add-on detail for Appendix I.
- Infra cost estimates in `docs/sin-rfp/requirements/tickets/INFRA-001-neon-to-rds-migration.md` are internal and based on assumptions; need approval and current AWS pricing validation before use.
- Migration plan uses synthetic data volumes (20M+ rows) pending real exports; actual data scope could materially change timeline and cost.
- No documented in-kind/value-add contributions or discounting policy.
