# Concerns and Missing Inputs - Delivery Schedule

- No milestone table/Gantt or concrete dates in repo; only phase durations. Need
  start/end dates, sequencing, and any blackout windows.
- No project governance/communications cadence documented (steering committee,
  status reporting, escalation); only decision register and DR incident comms.
- No project team roster, role assignments, or org chart/resumes in repo.
- Evidence folder is empty; no milestone table/Gantt or org chart artifacts.
- Dependencies on viaSport inputs not documented (legacy data extracts, SME
  workshops, validation windows, access to systems).
- Audit retention policy targets Object Lock + audit archive for 2026-02; confirm
  dependency in delivery schedule.
- Gap-closure plan lists open items that may affect schedule (retention
  automation, accessibility verification, notification delivery verification,
  analytics verification).
- If ops portal scope is enabled, dual-portal doc flags scope creep and
  dependencies on payments + seeded data; requires scope decision.
