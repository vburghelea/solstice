# Concerns / Missing Inputs - Appendices

- Appendices evidence folder is empty; no packaged artifacts yet.
  (`docs/sin-rfp/response/08-appendices/evidence/`)
- Requirements status conflicts between the coverage matrix and the verification
  report; reconcile before publishing the appendix matrix.
  (`docs/sin-rfp/requirements/requirements-coverage-matrix.md`,
  `docs/sin-rfp/review-plans/requirements-verification-report-2025-12-28.md`)
- Architecture diagrams exist only as mermaid in the reference doc; no exported
  images for submission packaging.
  (`docs/sin-rfp/phase-0/architecture-reference.md`)
- Migration strategy relies on synthetic placeholders; real BCAR/BCSI extracts,
  mapping validation, and reconciliation logs are not in repo.
  (`docs/sin-rfp/phase-0/migration-strategy.md`,
  `docs/sin-rfp/legacy-data-samples/README.md`)
- No migration runbook outputs (audit trail, error reports, reconciliation
  reports) captured yet.
- Security documentation is marked partial and lacks compliance attestations,
  insurance certificate, and DR drill evidence; Object Lock/Glacier and SES
  enforcement are pending.
  (`docs/sin-rfp/phase-0/security-controls.md`,
  `docs/sin-rfp/phase-0/audit-retention-policy.md`,
  `docs/sin-rfp/phase-0/backup-dr-plan.md`,
  `docs/sin-rfp/phase-0/data-residency.md`)
- Training materials are not documented beyond UI evidence screenshots; no
  audience-specific training outlines, facilitator guides, or support SLAs.
- Case studies, references, team bios/resumes, pricing worksheets, and optional
  add-ons/value-adds are not present in the repo.
