# Writing Style Guide - Austin's RFP Voice

## Primary Reference

**Always follow the tone, style, and word choice of:**
`/docs/sin-rfp/source/DO-NOT-COMMIT-CONFIDENTIAL-example-rfp-real.txt`

This is the canonical example for RFP writing. Match its formal, professional tone exactly.

## Anti-AI Writing Rules

### Never Use

- **Em dashes (—)** - dead giveaway of AI writing. Use commas, periods, or parentheses instead.
- Flowery adjectives or marketing superlatives
- "Unique combination of" or similar filler phrases
- Vague percentages as selling points ("90% complete")

### Prefer

- Direct, concrete statements
- Specific numbers when they add credibility (20.1M rows, sub-250ms)
- Simple explanations of technical terms: "SST (infrastructure as code)" not "SST (Serverless Stack)"
- "Performance" over "developer productivity" - focus on outcomes, not process

## Tone Observations from Austin's Edits

### 1. Show, Don't Tell

**Before:** "This level of pre-existing development significantly reduces delivery risk"
**Austin's approach:** Add the actual demo link with credentials. Let them see it.

### 2. Less Marketing, More Professional

**Before:** "90% of functionality is already built and tested"
**After:** "the extensive prototyping work already completed"

Why: Specific percentages can sound like a sales pitch. Professional language is more credible.

### 3. Simpler Role Titles

**Before:** "Full Stack Developer"
**After:** "Senior Developer"

Why: Less jargon, more universally understood.

### 4. Outcome-Focused Language

**Before:** "longevity, maintainability, and developer productivity"
**After:** "longevity, maintainability, and performance"

Why: viaSport cares about performance. Developer productivity is our internal concern.

### 5. Confidence Through Action

Adding live demo credentials directly in the executive summary is bold. It says "we have nothing to hide, try it yourself." This is more persuasive than any amount of description.

## Punctuation Alternatives to Em Dashes

| Instead of                       | Use                                |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| X—a custom degree combining Y    | X, a custom degree combining Y     |
| X—not greenfield development     | X, not greenfield development      |
| The technology stack—TanStack... | The technology stack (TanStack...) |

## General Principles

1. **Be concrete** - specific numbers, live demos, verifiable claims
2. **Be professional** - formal but not stiff, confident but not salesy
3. **Be direct** - say what you mean without padding
4. **Let work speak** - show the prototype, don't just describe it
5. **Respect the reader** - they're evaluating many proposals, be clear and scannable
