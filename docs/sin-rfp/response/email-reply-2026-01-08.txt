Hello Adam and Joe,

Thank you for the clarification on timing and budget. I understand the desire to let the RFP process inform investment decisions, it makes sense given the solution-dependent nature of costs.

The Fall 2026 operational target for core functionality is helpful context. I'll structure my proposal around that timeline with a phased approach through 2027 for additional capabilities.

With the Friday deadline approaching, I have a few technical questions below. I recognize some may not be easily answered on short notice, where that's the case, I'll clearly state our assumptions in the submission.

Legacy Migration (BCAR/BCSI)
1. What export methods are available for BCAR and BCSI (database access, API, built-in exports, etc.)?
2. Are you able to share any existing data dictionary or schema documents, or even better, redacted data samples?
3. Do BCAR/BCSI contain attachments that must be migrated?

RP-AGG-002 (Aggregation & Metadata)
4. What is the expected metadata set at launch (e.g., contribution agreements, NCCP fields, fiscal periods, org profiles, delegated access, contacts)?
5. Are any fields validated against authoritative sources (e.g., NCCP registry), or will the new system be the system of record?

Identity & Access
6. Is single sign-on required at launch? If yes, which identity provider(s) and protocol (SAML/OIDC)?

No need to rush, any answers you can provide will sharpen the proposal, and I'll document assumptions for the rest.

Thanks again for your help,
Austin Wallace
