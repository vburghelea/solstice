Austin note: My preferred way to iterate on this is by using Comments if possible. Please be direct, “this is crap” is a fine comment.
Please highlight any direct changes you make so I can feed it back into the system that is going to generate code; do not worry about wording changes yet. At this point higher (e.g. section-level) feedback is the most valuable as I will be regenerating this if we change the structure. 
1: Everyone checks this from a structural point of view (“needs this section here”, “needs to focus more on x”, “we don’t need x”), not a details pov; Tuesday
2: Nail down the structure; Tuesday
3: Edit to right structure with AI with the right structure; Tuesday 
4: I go through and do a hand edit; Wednesday

Standard Assumptions and Security Posture
The statements below apply across this response unless noted.
1.1 Data Residency and Privacy Summary
Primary data stores (RDS PostgreSQL, S3 object storage, backups, and audit archives) are hosted in AWS Canada (Central) (ca-central-1). Authenticated content is configured to avoid edge caching. Email notifications are delivered to recipients and may traverse external networks.
1.2 Security Model Summary
The security model follows the AWS shared responsibility approach: AWS secures the underlying cloud infrastructure, and we implement and operate the application controls, configuration, and monitoring required for viaSport's use case. The platform implements MFA, role-based access control, organization scoping, encryption in transit and at rest, and an immutable audit log with tamper-evident hashing. Security evidence is summarized in Appendix D: Security Architecture Summary. AWS compliance reports (SOC, ISO) are available via AWS Artifact upon request.
1.3 Prototype and Data Provenance Summary
A working prototype is available for evaluation in the sin-uat environment. No viaSport confidential data was used. Performance testing is run in sin-perf using synthetic data designed to match the scale characteristics described in the RFP. Performance and accessibility evidence is summarized in Appendix C: Performance Evidence. Demo credentials are listed in Appendix A: Live Demo Access, and a 15-minute validation path is provided in the Prototype Evaluation Guide.

Key Highlights
De-risked Delivery A working prototype is available for evaluation. This reduces delivery risk and allows evaluators to validate requirements directly. Access details are in Appendix A: Live Demo Access. The Prototype Evaluation Guide provides a 15-minute validation path tied to requirement IDs. See Section 1.3 for the standard prototype and data provenance summary.

Requirements Coverage The prototype covers the majority of the System Requirements Addendum today. Three requirements remain partial and are explicitly scoped with viaSport dependencies and delivery approach. The System Requirements Compliance Crosswalk provides the requirement-by-requirement view.

Security and Residency See Section 1.1 for data residency and privacy, and Section 1.2 for the security model summary and evidence references.

Delivery Timeline The proposed 30-week timeline targets Fall 2026 launch with comprehensive UX research and community engagement. The timeline enables proper user research with viaSport staff and PSO representatives, UAT with accessibility validation, and phased rollout. The core platform is already built, so the additional time focuses on getting the user experience right rather than building new features.

Proposed Solution Statement
Austin Wallace Tech proposes the Solstice platform, a purpose-built, reliable, and secure information management system aligned to the Strength in Numbers requirements.
Key Differentiators
1. Working Prototype, Not a Proposal

A functional prototype already exists and is available for evaluation. It addresses the majority of System Requirements Addendum items today and has been load-tested at production scale with 20.1 million rows.

2. Principal-Led Delivery

The architect and primary developer of the prototype will lead delivery. This reduces knowledge transfer risk and provides direct accountability.

3. Domain Expertise in Sport Data

The team combines enterprise data engineering with direct sport sector operations experience. Soleil Heaney brings perspective as a PSO executive, ensuring the platform reflects how sport organizations actually work. [Soleil to confirm wording]

4. British Columbia Based

The core team is based in British Columbia and remaining roles are expected to be BC based.

5. Canadian Data Residency

See Section 1.1, Data Residency and Privacy Summary.

6. Security and Privacy by Design

Security and privacy are built into delivery from discovery through operations. See Section 1.2, Security Model Summary.

Our approach aligns with OWASP application security practices, including the OWASP Top 10 and OWASP ASVS as a verification framework.

Security by Design Approach

Security requirements up front: Define security and privacy requirements during discovery (access control, retention, audit, monitoring), then validate them in the prototype and UAT.
Threat modeling: Run threat modeling for the core workflows (authentication, imports, exports, delegated access) and track mitigations as delivery items.
Shift-left DevSecOps: Automated code and dependency scanning in CI so issues are found before deployment.
Zero-trust access model: MFA, RBAC, and organization scoping enforced server-side for all data access.
Data protection and Canadian hosting region: See Section 1.1.
Monitoring and anomaly response: Detect suspicious authentication patterns, alert administrators, and apply automated lockout controls.
Immutable audit and integrity: Tamper-evident audit logging and retention controls to support forensic review and regulatory reporting.
Benefits to viaSport
Reduced Risk: Evaluate a working system before committing.
Accelerated Timeline: 18 weeks to rollout because the platform exists today.
Direct Accountability: Principal-led delivery with no organizational layers.
Sector Understanding: Experience leading amateur sport organizations, not just building software.
Secure and Safe: Embedding security and privacy by design from day 1 of development.
Sustainability: Serverless architecture and infrastructure as code reduce operating overhead.
Solution Overview
Workflow Summary
The Solstice platform supports the full reporting lifecycle from PSO submission to viaSport oversight and analytics.

PSOs submit data through forms, file uploads, or imports.
Validation rules check required fields and formatting on submission.
Reporting status is tracked with reminders and resubmission workflows.
Analytics and dashboards surface trends with role-based access controls.
Audit logs capture data changes, exports, and admin actions.
Multi-Tenant Model
Each organization has isolated data and role-based permissions. viaSport admins can view cross-organization reporting and analytics, while PSOs only access their own records.
viaSport Administrator Capabilities
Configure forms and reporting cycles
Manage organization access and delegated roles
Monitor submission status and compliance
Review audit logs and security events
Set retention policies and legal holds
Export analytics with audit logging
PSO Capabilities
Submit reports and supporting files
Track submission status and deadlines
Correct validation errors and resubmit
View organization-level dashboards
Export approved datasets within role permissions
Migration Summary
Legacy data is extracted, mapped, validated, and imported with an auditable trail and rollback support. See Service Approach: Data Migration for the detailed migration plan and cutover steps.
Service Approach: Data Submission and Reporting Web Portal
UX Strategy and Approach
The Solstice portal is designed to make data submission efficient for non-technical administrators. The UX approach is role-based, task-focused, and aligned to reporting deadlines.

User Group
Primary Tasks
UX Focus
viaSport Administrators
Oversight, analytics, compliance review
Cross-org dashboards, audit access, admin tools
PSO Reporters
Data submission, report tracking
Streamlined forms, progress tracking, deadline awareness
Data Stewards
Data quality, imports
Validation tools, error resolution, bulk operations

Role-Based Portal Design
Each user sees a personalized dashboard based on role and organization. The dashboard surfaces relevant actions, pending tasks, and submission status without requiring deep navigation.
Navigation and Workflow
Dashboard-led navigation: Cards and summaries link directly to forms, reporting tasks, analytics, and support.
Command palette: Keyboard navigation (Cmd or Ctrl plus K) to jump to pages, forms, and records.
Contextual links: Templates, guides, and support appear alongside relevant tasks.
Responsive Design
The interface adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports. Core workflows remain available on mobile for reviewers and administrators on the go.
Accessibility
The interface is built on Radix UI primitives and shadcn/ui components, which provide keyboard navigation and ARIA defaults. Accessibility evidence is summarized in Section 1.3.
UX Refinement Process
During Planning and Discovery we will:

Validate navigation structure against real viaSport workflows
Identify friction points from legacy system usage
Refine dashboard widgets to surface the most relevant information
Apply viaSport branding and terminology

Detailed functional compliance for forms, submissions, and reporting lives in System Requirements Compliance Crosswalk (DM-AGG-001 and RP-AGG-003).

Encryption Standards
In Transit: TLS 1.2+ for client and service communication.

At Rest: AES-256 via AWS KMS for database storage and S3 objects.

Encryption evidence is summarized in Section 1.2.
Audit Log Retention and Archival
Audit logs are immutable and archived to S3 Deep Archive based on retention policy configuration. Retention durations and archive schedules will be finalized with viaSport (TBD). Legal holds are supported to prevent deletion.
Why PostgreSQL (Not a Columnar Warehouse)
viaSport's scale of 20M historical rows with 1M rows per year is well within PostgreSQL capability. A dedicated columnar warehouse would add cost and complexity without benefit at this scale.

Migration Sequence
Organizations and hierarchies
Users and role assignments
Historical submissions
Documents and attachments
Mapping Process
Mapping templates define source fields, target fields, transformation rules, and validation requirements. Templates are reviewed and approved by viaSport before execution.
Cleansing
Data quality issues are handled through:

Format normalization for dates and numeric values
Enum mapping to align legacy values with new fields
Duplicate detection and manual review workflows
Validation
Every imported record is validated against form definitions and required fields. Validation errors are logged with row-level detail for correction.
Rollback
Imports are tagged with an import_job_id. Imports can be rolled back within the configured window (7 days by default) if issues are discovered after load.
Audit Trail and Success Verification
Audit Trail
Migration actions are logged with:

Import job creation, status changes, and completion
Mapping template creation and updates
Row-level validation errors
Rollback events

Import jobs and audit logs provide traceability for each migration run. Retention durations are configurable and will be confirmed with viaSport (TBD).
Success Verification
Migration success is verified through reconciliation:

Check
Method
Row counts
Source count matches target count
Checksums
Hash comparison of key fields
Spot checks
Manual verification of sample records by viaSport
Referential integrity
Foreign keys validated

Data Quality Targets and Defect Workflow
Metric
Target
Successful import rate
99%+ of records
Validation pass rate
95%+ on first attempt
Duplicate detection
100% of exact duplicates flagged
Referential integrity
100% of relationships valid


Defects are classified by severity and resolved before moving to the next migration phase.
Technical Infrastructure
Import Processing
Large imports run in two lanes:

Interactive lane: Validation and import for smaller files inside the app.
Batch lane: ECS Fargate worker for large files in perf and prod; local fallback available in dev.
Checkpointing and Errors
Checkpointed processing allows resumable jobs.
Row-level errors are captured and can be reviewed or re-imported.
Dependencies on viaSport
Migration execution requires:

Legacy system access (export capability or direct database access)
Schema documentation for BCAR and BCSI
Data dictionary and field mapping approval
SME availability for validation and sign-off

Import tooling is ready today. Extraction approach will be finalized during Discovery based on legacy system capabilities. See System Requirements Compliance Crosswalk (DM-AGG-006) for detailed compliance mapping.
Cutover and Change Management
A successful migration includes technical data movement and a managed transition for viaSport staff and PSOs.

Security Testing
Security vulnerability scanning runs on every commit to identify issues early followed by scheduled and pre-release scans to identify run-time issues.
Security testing covers authentication, authorization, and audit integrity, plus application vulnerability testing.

Automated security checks

SAST and dependency scanning run in CI on each change to identify common vulnerabilities early.
DAST runs against a staging environment on a schedule and again prior to major releases.

OWASP Top 10:2025 coverage

Our security testing program maps to the OWASP Top 10 categories. The full mapping is provided in Appendix J: OWASP Top 10:2025 Mapping.

Operational monitoring

In production, application-level detection is combined with AWS monitoring and logging (CloudWatch/CloudTrail) to support detection, alerting, and incident response. High-severity security events (account lockouts, anomaly flags) emit CloudWatch metrics for alerting.

Functional security testing validates:

MFA and password recovery
Session expiry and step-up authentication
Role-based access enforcement
Audit log integrity and hash chain verification
Account lockout and anomaly detection

Security evidence is summarized in Section 1.2.

AI Enablement Foundation (Built)
The platform includes a production-ready AI foundation layer that enables rapid delivery of AI features during the engagement. This infrastructure is fully implemented:

Component
Description
AWS Bedrock integration
Claude, Amazon Nova, and Cohere models via Bedrock in ca-central-1
Central AI service
Unified interface with retries, timeouts, and error handling
Prompt template registry
Versioned prompts with audit trail and rollback capability
Structured output validation
Zod schema validation ensuring AI responses match expected formats
Usage logging and costs
Per-request tracking of tokens, latency, cost estimates by org and user
Quota enforcement
Rate limiting and budget controls per tenant and user
Embedding support
Cohere and Amazon Titan embeddings for semantic search


AI features use AWS Bedrock with models hosted exclusively in ca-central-1. No AI provider outside Canada will be used without explicit written authorization from viaSport.
AI Feature Candidates
The following AI features are included in the contract scope. During Planning, we will conduct UX research with viaSport staff and PSO representatives to determine which features deliver the highest value and should be prioritized for implementation.

Feature
Description
Target Users
Value
AI report narratives
Generate natural language summaries from analytics dashboards for board reports and briefings
viaSport admins
Reduce manual report writing by 60-80%
Natural language query
Ask questions in plain English and receive structured answers from the data warehouse
viaSport admins, PSO
Self-service analytics without SQL
AI dashboard builder
Describe a visualization in words and generate chart configurations automatically
viaSport admins
Faster dashboard creation
Semantic document search
Search submissions and documents by meaning rather than exact keywords
All users
Find relevant records faster
Data quality AI
Detect anomalies and outliers in submissions with plain-language explanations
viaSport admins
Catch errors before they affect reports
Submission assistant
Contextual guidance and suggestions while completing forms based on historical patterns
PSO staff
Reduce submission errors and rework

Prioritization Approach
AI features will not be enabled without user research. Our approach:

Discovery interviews with viaSport staff and PSO representatives to understand pain points
Value mapping to identify which features address the highest-impact workflows
Prototype testing of prioritized features with real users before production release
Iterative rollout starting with the highest-value feature, gathering feedback before expanding

The foundation work is complete. We will implement the AI features that drive real value for viaSport and PSOs based on what we learn during research.
Responsible AI Approach
Principle
Implementation
Transparency
All AI-generated content is clearly labeled; users see when AI assisted
Human-in-the-loop
AI outputs require human review before publishing or external sharing
Privacy by design
No PII in prompts; data aggregated or anonymized before AI processing
No unauthorized training
viaSport data is never used for model training without explicit consent
Bias mitigation
Regular review of AI outputs for demographic or organizational bias
Audit trail
All AI requests logged with prompt version, user, timestamp, and response characteristics
Data residency
AWS Bedrock in ca-central-1 only; no non-Canadian AI providers without written consent

Open Standards, APIs, and Open Source
Open Standards
TOTP (RFC 6238) for MFA
CSV and Excel for import and export
JSON for data interchange
TLS 1.2+ for transport security
AES-256 for encryption at rest
APIs
Internal APIs are structured for extension. External integrations will be scoped with viaSport during Discovery.

Appendix D: Security Architecture Summary
Shared Responsibility Model
The security model follows the AWS shared responsibility approach: AWS secures the underlying cloud infrastructure, and we implement and operate the application controls, configuration, and monitoring required for viaSport's use case. AWS compliance reports (SOC, ISO) are available via AWS Artifact upon request.
Data Residency
Primary data stores (RDS PostgreSQL, S3 object storage, backups, and audit archives) are hosted in AWS Canada (Central) (ca-central-1). Authenticated content is configured to avoid edge caching. Email notifications are delivered to recipients and may traverse external networks.
Encryption
Scope
Standard
In Transit
TLS 1.2+
At Rest (Database)
AES-256 via AWS KMS
At Rest (Storage)
AES-256 via AWS KMS
Secrets
AWS Secrets Manager (SST-managed, deploy-time)

Authentication
Feature
Implementation
Multi-Factor Authentication
TOTP with backup codes
Password Requirements
Configurable password policy
Session Management
Secure cookies, configurable expiry
Account Lockout
Automatic after failed attempt threshold

Authorization
Feature
Implementation
Role-Based Access Control
Owner, Admin, Reporter, Viewer roles
Organization Scoping
All queries scoped to user's organization
Field-Level Permissions
Sensitive fields restricted by role
Step-Up Authentication
Required for admin actions and exports

Audit Trail
Feature
Implementation
Scope
All user actions, data changes, auth events
Immutability
Hash chain verification: each entry hashes the previous, rendering the trail mathematically immutable
Retention
Retention policies and legal holds (durations TBD)

Compliance
PIPEDA aligned data handling practices
AWS Data Processing Addendum (DPA) in place
CloudTrail API audit logging with CIS Benchmark alarms (root usage, IAM changes, security group changes)

Appendix J: OWASP Top 10:2025 Mapping
Our security testing program maps to the OWASP Top 10 categories:

A01: Broken Access Control - Attackers bypassing authorization to access other users' data (critical for SEC-AGG-001).
A02: Security Misconfiguration - Unsecured S3 buckets, default passwords, or overly permissive cloud settings.
A03: Software Supply Chain Failures - Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or compromised build pipeline.
A04: Cryptographic Failures - Weak encryption or plain-text data storage (directly impacts PIPEDA compliance).
A05: Injection - SQL, NoSQL, or command injection.
A06: Insecure Design - Architectural flaws that cannot be fixed by coding.
A07: Authentication Failures - Weak MFA, credential stuffing, or session hijacking (directly impacts SEC-AGG-001).
A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures - Tampering with updates or data without verification.
A09: Security Logging and Alerting Failures - Lack of real-time monitoring (directly impacts SEC-AGG-002 and SEC-AGG-004).
A10: Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions - Error messages that leak sensitive info or systems that fail open.
