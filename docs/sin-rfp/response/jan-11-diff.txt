-
-### Role-Based Portal Design
-
-Each user sees a personalized dashboard based on role and organization. The dashboard surfaces relevant actions, pending tasks, and submission status without requiring deep navigation.
-
-### Navigation and Workflow
-
-- **Dashboard-led navigation:** Cards and summaries link directly to forms, reporting tasks, analytics, and support.
-- **Command palette:** Keyboard navigation (Cmd or Ctrl plus K) to jump to pages, forms, and records.
-- **Contextual links:** Templates, guides, and support appear alongside relevant tasks.
-
-### Responsive Design
-
-The interface adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports. Core workflows remain available on mobile for reviewers and administrators on the go.
-
-### Accessibility
-
-The interface is built on Radix UI primitives and shadcn/ui components, which provide keyboard navigation and ARIA defaults. Accessibility evidence is summarized in Section 1.3.
-
-### UX Refinement Process
-
-During Planning and Discovery we will:
-
-- Validate navigation structure against real viaSport workflows
-- Identify friction points from legacy system usage
-- Refine dashboard widgets to surface the most relevant information
-- Apply viaSport branding and terminology
-
-Detailed functional compliance for forms, submissions, and reporting lives in **System Requirements Compliance Crosswalk** (DM-AGG-001 and RP-AGG-003).
