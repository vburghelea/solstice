Executive Summary
viaSport seeks a new foundational digital layer for sport in British Columbia. Austin Wallace Tech Corporation, a proudly local digital solutions provider, proposes Solstice as a strong fit for this work.

Solstice is a modern information management platform designed for sport-sector reporting, analytics, and governance. The technology is user-friendly and designed to make data submission, compliance tracking, and cross-organization analytics powerful yet intuitive. The system is designed for easy analytics generation, and data can be integrated and responsibly shared across open-source technologies. APIs can securely push reports on data ranging from participation trends to funding allocations to third-party applications in near-real time.

Austin Wallace Tech Corporation is uniquely fit to lead this work. Its founder, Austin Wallace, brings real-world experience as a former member of the Canadian National Quadball team to maximize the system's value for amateur sports leagues. As a British Columbian in sports, Wallace also has a personal stake in the success of viaSport's modernization. Wallace and his team are dedicated to bringing the same drive that propelled Wallace to globally leading the sport of quadball and making a major impact at the NHL to viaSport's modernization.

Solstice is a working baseline solution with the ability to handle all 25 requirements in the System Requirements Addendum from Day 1. Austin Wallace Tech Corporation does anticipate customization work to align the product with viaSport’s needs, but the underlying capabilities will be available immediately. By procuring Solstice, viaSport will be investing in a solution in which its specific needs, rather than foundational build work, will be the focus of development. viaSport and Austin Wallace Tech will be free to jointly invest their effort and project time on user experience, discovery, migration accuracy, accessibility validation, operational reliability, and adoption.

Solstice is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution which allows for easy scaling and AI-native integration. The initial subscription will last for a three-year base term with two optional one-year extensions. A one-time implementation fee will be charged to complete initial viaSport configuration, data migration, User Acceptance Testing (UAT), and rollout. The platform subscription and managed service provisions include hosting, monitoring, security patching, support, ongoing product updates, and up to 200 hours/year of enhancement capacity, with additional hours available on a supplemental basis.

Solstice's Service Level Agreement will provide viaSport clear accountability under its integrated, single-vendor delivery and operations model. Implementation and managed services are bundled into a single package, avoiding annual procurements for hosting and support.

Solution Overview
Solstice is a cloud-hosted platform with its artifacts and user data stored in AWS’s Canada-Central-1 region. AWS cloud storage is the gold standard for cloud hosting and allows Solstice to scale easily. The platform is capable of replacing viaSport’s data collection system in its entirety.

The platform is built by athletes who care deeply about sports governance and data. Solstice delivers analytics tuned for the realities of sport administration, not generic business dashboards. A PSO executive director can track their annual submission compliance at a glance. viaSport staff can compare participation growth across sports, identifying where women's programs are thriving and where investment gaps remain. Funding analysts can model how provincial grants flow to different regions and disciplines. And when the Ministry asks about sport's impact on British Columbians, the data is ready: participation trends, regional coverage, and program reach, without weeks of manual spreadsheet assembly.

Solstice's user experience is, by default, convenient and effective. However, to maximize user adoption, Austin Wallace Tech will work with viaSport to customize the UX to match viaSport workflows, making submitting reports as easy as possible for organizations. A working evaluation environment is available for review:

Additional detail and a guided evaluation walkthrough are available in **Appendix A: Prototype Evaluation Access**.

The cloud-native architecture and AI integration will vastly improve the administrative process for data collection and reporting. Solstice includes a production-ready AI foundation built on AWS Bedrock, hosted exclusively in AWS Canada (Central) for data residency compliance. The platform already supports natural language analytics queries—users can ask questions like "How many athletes registered in 2023 by sport?" and receive structured results without navigating complex filters. Additional AI capabilities (report narratives, semantic document search, data quality assistance) are available as governed, optional modules enabled only with viaSport's explicit approval.

By virtue of being a SaaS platform on AWS, scalability will be easy and affordable, with functionally no limit on computing power available to viaSport. AWS cloud operation is also highly sustainable—an Accenture study found customers running compute-heavy workloads could reduce carbon emissions by up to 94% by switching from on-premises to AWS cloud.[^1] Users will experience full quality and functionality regardless of scale thanks to the cloud-native architecture.

The solution is built on a modern, extensible architecture. New modules and functionality can be delivered quickly once prioritized through viaSport's governance process. API integration enables streamlined data exchange with external systems as needed.

Solution Specifics
Solstice offers a fully-developed and ready-to-implement website portal capable of handling user-driven reporting and data submission. While the portal is sleek and operational out of the gate, the portal is fully configurable to the needs of viaSport.
The system’s integration with AWS will allow for easy data storage and warehousing for both viaSport’s historical data and its ongoing data needs.
Historical data will be imported in five migration phases (discovery, mapping, pilot migration, full migration, and validation) and is expected to be completed by week 22. A full breakdown of the migration stages can be found in the Service Approach section.
The platform is fully realized at present, but can continue to be customized and designed for viaSport’s needs. For information about the cloud environment, security and access model, full system architecture, and process automations, see the Service Approach: Data Submission and Web Reporting Portal section.
Testing and quality assurance is integrated by default into the Austin Wallace Tech workflow. Examples of system security protocols, user acceptance testing, and defect resolution can be found in the UX Strategy and Approach section and the Backup, Recover, and Encryption sections.
Great software is nothing without an excited user base. Austin Wallace Tech will work with viaSport throughout the onboarding process, will offer bi-weekly office hours to check in on the continued success of the rollout, and will provide continuous training as new users join and new features are released. Administrators will be provided with supplemental training on how to manage users and access.
The Solstice prototype was tested on more than 20 million rows of synthetic data to validate its capabilities. See Appendix C for the full Performance Evaluation results.
The Austin Wallace Tech team brings relevant delivery experience from data-intensive environments. Austin Wallace combines enterprise data engineering experience (New Jersey Devils, processing 10M+ rows per game; Clio, production pipelines with SOC II compliance) with direct amateur sport governance as former Chair of the International Quidditch Association, where he led technology strategy for 30+ national governing bodies. The broader team includes specialists in UX research and accessibility (Ruslan Hétu), PSO operations and governance (Soleil Heaney, former Executive Director of Quadball Canada and Manager of Member Services at BC Soccer), and security/compliance advisory from leaders with Fortune 100 and BC public sector experience.
