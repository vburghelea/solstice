# RFP Response Restructure Plan

This document defines the structure, patterns, and actionable steps to finalize the viaSport SIN RFP response.

---

## Goals

1. **Make compliance obvious** — Evaluators can quickly confirm we meet each requirement
2. **Make prototype advantage unmissable** — "Built Today" is prominent in every requirement
3. **Eliminate redundancy** — Service Approach = methodology; System Requirements = compliance
4. **Be honest about gaps** — Clear "Remaining Scope" and "viaSport Dependencies" for every requirement
5. **Professional polish** — No "TBD" placeholders, no weak credentials in the document

---

## Source Documents

The response addresses two viaSport documents:

| Document | Purpose | Our Response |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `VIASPORT-PROVIDED-viasport-sin-rfp.md` | RFP structure, evaluation criteria | Sections 01-04, 06-09 |
| `VIASPORT-PROVIDED-system-requirements-addendum.md` | 25 specific requirements (DM/RP/SEC/TO/UI) | Section 05 |

---

```

---

## New Sections to Create

### 02-prototype-evaluation-guide.md

This is the "bridge" that makes the prototype strategy feel intentional. Place it early so evaluators understand how to use the prototype for validation.

```markdown
# Prototype Evaluation Guide

## Purpose

This prototype exists to de-risk delivery and demonstrate requirement alignment
before contract award. viaSport can evaluate a working system, not a proposal.

## Data Provenance

**No viaSport confidential data was used.** Performance testing used synthetic
data designed to match the scale characteristics described in the RFP:

| Table | Rows | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| form_submissions | 10.0M | Simulates 10+ years of PSO submissions |
| audit_logs | 7.0M | Realistic audit trail volume |
| notifications | 2.0M | Email/in-app notification history |
| bi_query_log | 1.0M | Analytics query patterns |
| **Total** | **20.1M** | Matches RFP "20+ million rows" context |

## What's Production-Ready Today

- Authentication with TOTP MFA and backup codes
- Role-based access control (owner, admin, reporter, viewer)
- Organization-scoped data isolation
- Tamper-evident audit log with hash chain verification
- Form builder with 8 field types including file uploads
- Submission tracking with version history
- Native BI platform (pivot tables, charts, export)
- Import wizard with field mapping, preview, rollback
- S3 storage with Object Lock for immutability
- Automated data retention and archival
- Help center with searchable guides and FAQ
- Support request system with priority and SLA tracking

## What Will Be Finalized With viaSport

| Item | Timing | Dependency |
|------|--------|------------|
| BCAR/BCSI extraction method | Discovery (Weeks 1-2) | Legacy system access |
| Form templates and reporting metadata | Discovery (Weeks 1-2) | viaSport data dictionary |
| Branding (logo, colors) | Development (Week 3) | Brand assets from viaSport |
| Program-specific fields (NCCP, contribution agreements) | Development (Weeks 3-8) | viaSport SME input |
| Independent penetration test | Pre-UAT (Week 8) | Security specialist |

## Demo Access

Demo credentials are provided via secure channel upon request. Accounts require
password reset on first login to ensure credential security.

**To request access:** Contact Austin Wallace at [email]

**Environment:** sin-perf (performance testing environment with production-like data)

## 15-Minute Demo Script

1. **Login & MFA** — Authenticate with email/password, complete TOTP challenge
2. **Dashboard** — Observe role-based content (admin vs reporter view)
3. **Form Builder** — Create a test form with required fields and file upload
4. **Submit Data** — Complete and submit the form, observe status tracking
5. **Version History** — Edit submission, view change history with attribution
6. **Analytics** — Navigate to BI, build pivot table, export to CSV
7. **Audit Logs** — Review recent actions, verify hash chain integrity
8. **Help Center** — Search for a topic, view contextual guidance
9. **Import Wizard** — Upload CSV, map fields, preview validation results

## Requirement Validation Crosswalk

| To validate... | Requirement | Demo path |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Form building | DM-AGG-001 | Dashboard → Forms → Create Form |
| File uploads | DM-AGG-001 | Form Builder → Add File Field → Submit |
| Import/rollback | DM-AGG-006 | Dashboard → Imports → New Import |
| Submission tracking | RP-AGG-003 | Dashboard → My Submissions |
| Self-service analytics | RP-AGG-005 | Analytics → New Query → Pivot |
| Export with access control | RP-AGG-005 | Pivot → Export → Verify scoping |
| MFA authentication | SEC-AGG-001 | Login flow |
| Role-based access | SEC-AGG-001 | Compare admin vs reporter dashboards |
| Audit trail | SEC-AGG-004 | Admin → Audit Logs → Filter |
| Hash chain verification | SEC-AGG-004 | Audit Logs → Verify Integrity |
| Guided walkthroughs | TO-AGG-002 | Help → Start Tour |
| Help center search | TO-AGG-003 | Help → Search |
| Support requests | UI-AGG-006 | Help → Submit Request |

## Prototype Positioning

> We built this prototype to prove feasibility and de-risk delivery. We still
> treat Discovery as mandatory to validate workflows, templates, and migration
> realities. The prototype is not a substitute for stakeholder alignment—it's
> an accelerator.
```

```

---

## Per-Requirement Block Pattern

Every requirement in Section 05 follows this structure:

```markdown
### XX-AGG-NNN: Title

**Requirement:**
> Quoted verbatim from the System Requirements Addendum.

**Built Today:**
- Bullet points describing what exists in the prototype
- Be specific: "8 field types" not "multiple field types"
- Include technical details where relevant

**Remaining Scope:**
- What's left to build (be honest)
- Or "None — fully implemented" if complete

**viaSport Dependencies:**
- What we need from viaSport to complete this
- Or omit section if no dependencies

**Approach:**
Brief description of how remaining scope will be addressed. Cross-reference
Section 04 methodology where applicable.

**Evidence:**
- Demo path: Dashboard → Forms → Create Form
- Appendix reference: See Appendix C for load test results
```

### Example Block

```markdown
### DM-AGG-006: Legacy Data Migration & Bulk Import

**Requirement:**
> The system shall provide tooling and configurable mapping templates to import
> historical data from CSV/Excel, legacy databases, or APIs, including validation,
> error-handling, and rollback.

**Built Today:**
- Import wizard with step-by-step interface (upload → map → preview → commit)
- CSV and Excel parsing with automatic type detection
- Field mapping with reusable templates
- Row-level validation with detailed error reporting
- Failed rows logged to S3 with error type and source data
- Job-wide rollback within 7-day window via import_job_id tagging
- Batch processing via AWS ECS Fargate (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM)
- Checkpointed processing for resumability on large imports
- File field imports with JSON payloads (storageKey/signedUrl)

**Remaining Scope:**
- BCAR/BCSI extraction method (depends on legacy system capabilities)
- Organization and user import pipelines (form submissions only today)
- Phone/postal format normalization beyond basic type parsing

**viaSport Dependencies:**
- Legacy system export capability or direct database access
- Schema documentation for BCAR/BCSI field mapping
- SME availability for field mapping review and approval

**Approach:**
Extraction method will be determined during Discovery (Weeks 1-2) based on
legacy system capabilities. See Section 04 Migration Methodology for phased
approach, validation strategy, and rollback procedures.

**Evidence:**
- Demo: Dashboard → Imports → New Import → Upload CSV
- Tested with multi-million row datasets in sin-perf environment
- ECS task deployed and verified operational
```

---

## Section 04: Service Approach (Methodology Focus)

Section 04 answers the RFP's "Service Approach and Responsiveness" questions with methodology, not per-requirement detail.

### File Structure

| File | Covers | RFP Questions Answered |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| `platform-infrastructure.md` | AWS services, hosting, tenancy, data residency, encryption, dev workflow, environments | "Data Warehousing" + "Platform Design" |
| `testing-qa.md` | Testing layers, UAT strategy, defect management | "Testing & Quality Assurance" |
| `migration-methodology.md` | Phased approach, validation, rollback, audit trail | "Data Migration" |
| `training-delivery.md` | Audiences, delivery model, help desk, SLAs | "Training and Onboarding" |

### Content Guidelines

- **Length:** ~3-4 pages per file, ~15 pages total
- **Focus:** Process, philosophy, approach
- **Cross-references:** "See Section 05 DM-AGG-006 for import wizard capabilities"
- **No per-requirement detail:** That belongs in Section 05

### Why Merge Data Warehousing + Platform Design?

The RFP separates these, but they overlap significantly:
- Both discuss AWS services
- Both discuss encryption and security
- Both discuss tenancy model

Merging into "Platform & Infrastructure" eliminates redundancy while still answering all RFP questions.

## Estimated Effort

| Phase | Hours | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Phase 1: Create new sections | 2 | Can use templates above |
| Phase 2: Restructure Section 04 | 2 | Merge and condense |
| Phase 3: Rewrite Section 05 | 4 | 25 requirements × 10 min each |
| Phase 4: Polish existing | 1 | Search/replace + additions |
| Phase 5: Assembly and review | 1 | Final compilation |
| **Total** | **10 hours** | |

Phases 2-4 can run in parallel after Phase 1 completes.

---

## Success Criteria

The restructured response should make it effortless for evaluators to:

1. **Confirm requirement compliance** — Master crosswalk table answers this in 60 seconds
2. **Understand what's real vs. planned** — Every requirement has explicit "Built Today" and "Remaining Scope"
3. **Validate claims via demo** — Prototype Evaluation Guide provides exact demo paths
4. **Assess delivery risk** — viaSport dependencies are explicit and scoped
5. **Navigate the document** — Clear structure matches RFP while eliminating redundancy

---

## Key Messaging to Maintain

Throughout the document, reinforce these themes:

1. **Prototype as accelerator, not substitute for discovery**
   > "We built this prototype to prove feasibility and de-risk delivery. We still treat Discovery as mandatory to validate workflows, templates, and migration realities."

2. **Data provenance**
   > "No viaSport confidential data was used. Performance testing used synthetic data designed to match RFP scale characteristics."

3. **Honest about gaps**
   > "Three requirements have remaining scope that depends on viaSport input or legacy system access."

4. **Security is production-ready**
   > "S3 Object Lock, tamper-evident audit logs, MFA, Canadian data residency, and encryption at rest/in-transit are all implemented."

---

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this plan
2. Execute Phase 1 (create new sections)
3. Execute Phases 2-4 in parallel
4. Execute Phase 5 (assembly)
5. Share compiled document for review
6. Convert to PDF/DOCX for submission

# Service Approach: Data Migration

## Migration Methodology

### Approach

Data migration follows a phased approach that minimizes risk and allows validation at each stage. The legacy systems (BCAR and BCSI) remain in read-only mode until migration is verified and signed off by viaSport.

### Migration Phases

| Phase                      | Duration  | Activities                                                                                             | Exit Criteria                    |
| -------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Discovery                  | Weeks 1-2 | Obtain sample exports, document legacy schemas, assess data quality, identify transformation rules     | Schema mapping document approved |
| Mapping and Transformation | Weeks 2-3 | Build mapping templates, define validation rules, create transformation scripts, test with sample data | Mapping templates validated      |
| Pilot Migration            | Weeks 3-4 | Migrate subset (one PSO), validate accuracy, refine mappings                                           | Pilot data verified by viaSport  |
| Full Migration             | Weeks 4-6 | Migrate in sequence: organizations, users, submissions, documents                                      | Reconciliation checks pass       |
| Validation and Cutover     | Weeks 6-7 | Full reconciliation, UAT on migrated data, viaSport sign-off, legacy set to archive                    | Sign-off received                |

### Migration Sequence

Data is migrated in dependency order to maintain referential integrity:

1. **Organizations:** Hierarchy of viaSport, PSOs, and clubs
2. **Users:** User accounts and role assignments
3. **Historical Submissions:** Form data linked to organizations
4. **Documents:** Files linked to submissions

### Mapping Process

Each data type requires a mapping template that defines:

- Source field in legacy system
- Target field in Solstice
- Transformation rules (format conversion, enum mapping, null handling)
- Validation rules (required fields, format checks, referential integrity)

Mapping templates are reviewed and approved by viaSport before migration execution.

### Cleansing

Data quality issues identified during Discovery are addressed through:

- **Format normalization:** Standardize date formats, phone numbers, postal codes
- **Enum mapping:** Map legacy values to new system values
- **Null handling:** Define defaults or flag for manual review
- **Duplicate detection:** Identify and flag potential duplicates for viaSport review

### Validation

Every imported record passes through validation:

- Schema validation (required fields, data types)
- Business rule validation (valid date ranges, referential integrity)
- Format validation (email format, postal code format)

Records that fail validation are logged with specific error messages for triage.

### Rollback

All imported records are tagged with an `import_job_id`. If issues are discovered after import:

- Entire import job can be rolled back by job ID
- Partial rollbacks supported for specific record types
- Legacy system remains available as source of truth until sign-off

## Audit Trail and Success Verification

### Audit Trail

Every migration action is logged:

| Event                    | Logged Information                             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Import job created       | Job ID, source, target, initiator, timestamp   |
| Mapping template applied | Template version, field mappings               |
| Record imported          | Source ID, target ID, transformation applied   |
| Validation error         | Record ID, field, error type, error message    |
| Rollback executed        | Job ID, records affected, initiator, timestamp |

Logs are stored in S3 and retained for 7 years, consistent with the platform's audit retention policy.

### Success Verification

Migration success is verified through reconciliation:

| Check                 | Method                                             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Row counts            | Source count matches target count (per table)      |
| Checksums             | Hash comparison of key fields                      |
| Spot checks           | Manual verification of sample records by viaSport  |
| Referential integrity | All foreign key relationships valid                |
| Business rules        | Sample queries confirm expected data relationships |

### Sign-Off Process

Migration is not considered complete until viaSport provides formal sign-off. Sign-off criteria:

1. All reconciliation checks pass
2. Spot checks verified by viaSport staff
3. UAT completed on migrated data
4. No blocking issues in defect log

## Data Quality Targets and Defect Workflow

### Data Quality Targets

| Metric                 | Target                           |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Successful import rate | 99%+ of records                  |
| Validation pass rate   | 95%+ on first attempt            |
| Duplicate detection    | 100% of exact duplicates flagged |
| Referential integrity  | 100% of relationships valid      |

### Defect Classification

| Severity | Definition                                            | Response                                     |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Critical | Data loss or corruption risk                          | Block migration, immediate resolution        |
| High     | Significant data quality issue affecting many records | Resolve before proceeding to next phase      |
| Medium   | Data quality issue affecting subset of records        | Queue for resolution, proceed with migration |
| Low      | Minor formatting or cosmetic issues                   | Log for post-migration cleanup               |

### Defect Workflow

1. **Detection:** Automated validation or manual review identifies issue
2. **Classification:** Assign severity based on impact
3. **Triage:** Determine resolution approach (automated fix, manual correction, accept as-is)
4. **Resolution:** Apply fix or document acceptance rationale
5. **Verification:** Confirm fix resolves issue
6. **Closure:** Update defect log with resolution

### Defect Reporting

viaSport receives regular defect reports during migration:

- Daily summary during active migration phases
- Detailed report before each phase sign-off
- Final reconciliation report at migration completion

## Technical Infrastructure

### Import Processing

Large-scale imports are processed using AWS ECS Fargate:

| Parameter  | Value                |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
| Compute    | 2 vCPU               |
| Memory     | 4 GB RAM             |
| Storage    | 50 GB                |
| Chunk size | 1,000 rows per batch |

### Checkpointing

Long-running imports use checkpointing for resumability:

- Progress saved after each chunk
- Failed imports can resume from last successful checkpoint
- No need to restart from beginning after transient failures

### Error Handling

- Row-level errors logged to S3
- Error reports include source row, error type, and suggested resolution
- Failed rows can be corrected and re-imported without affecting successful rows

## Dependencies on viaSport

Migration methodology will be finalized based on viaSport's legacy system capabilities. Key questions to resolve during Discovery:

1. **Export format:** Can BCAR/BCSI export to CSV/Excel, or is direct database access required?
2. **Schema documentation:** Does documentation exist for legacy data models?
3. **Data quality:** Are there known issues (duplicates, inconsistent formats) to plan for?
4. **Access:** Who maintains legacy systems and will be available during migration?

Our import infrastructure is production-ready. The extraction approach will be determined collaboratively based on legacy system capabilities.

# Executive Summary

Austin Wallace Tech is pleased to respond to viaSport British Columbia's Request for Proposal for the Strength in Numbers Project: B.C. Amateur Sport Information Management System Replacement. We believe that British Columbia's amateur sport sector deserves a modern, secure, and purpose-built information management platform that enables informed decision-making, reduces administrative burden, and sets a robust digital foundation for the province's next decade of sport development. That is why we have invested in building a working prototype specifically designed to meet viaSport's requirements.

Replacing legacy systems that have served the sector for over 15 years presents both an opportunity and a risk. The opportunity is to create a foundational digital layer for amateur sport in B.C.: a shared data and information platform that transforms how participation, funding, equity, and impact are understood. The risk is that new system development often encounters delays, cost overruns, and gaps between design and delivery. We have addressed this risk directly by building a functional prototype that already satisfies the majority of system requirements and has been load-tested at production scale with 20.1 million rows of data. This approach significantly de-risks viaSport's decision and demonstrates our commitment to delivering a proven solution, not a promise.

The key highlights of our response are as follows:

**De-Risked Delivery:** We are not proposing to build a system from scratch. A working prototype already exists, purpose-built for viaSport's Strength in Numbers requirements. This prototype has been load-tested with 20.1 million rows of historical data, achieving sub-250 millisecond response times (p95) with zero server errors. The prototype implements the majority of the System Requirements Addendum items today, with the remaining items scoped and scheduled for delivery. This level of pre-existing development significantly reduces delivery risk and accelerates the path to production.

A live prototype environment is available upon request; access details are provided in Appendix A (placeholders until final deployment).

**Domain Expertise:** Austin Wallace, Project Lead, brings a unique combination of enterprise data engineering experience and deep understanding of amateur sport governance. As Chair of the International Quidditch Association, he led data and technology strategy for 30+ national governing bodies worldwide. At the New Jersey Devils (NHL), he served as sole Data Developer, building an end-to-end data platform processing 10 million rows per game of NHL tracking data to support multi-million dollar player decisions. At Clio, he owns 10+ Databricks pipelines and unlocked over $1 million in value through responsible AI enablement. His B.Sc. from UBC in Analytical Sports Management, a custom degree combining business, statistics, and machine learning, was designed specifically for this intersection of sport and data.

Will Siddal, Senior Developer, brings 2+ years of full-stack development experience at Teck Resources, one of Canada's largest mining companies. At Teck, he built mission-critical reporting pipelines processing billions of rows annually, developed internal tools using React and TypeScript, and managed cloud infrastructure on AWS using Terraform. His experience spans the full stack: Python, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, and modern frontend frameworks. Will holds a degree from Simon Fraser University and is based in British Columbia.

**Canadian Data Residency & Compliance:** All data is hosted exclusively in AWS ca-central-1 (Montreal), ensuring compliance with Canadian privacy statutes including PIPEDA. The platform implements encryption at rest (AWS KMS) and in transit (TLS 1.2+), multi-factor authentication with TOTP and backup codes, role-based access control with organization-scoped permissions, and immutable audit logging with tamper-evident hash chains. Audit logs are retained for 7 years with archival to S3 Glacier Deep Archive. AWS maintains a Data Processing Addendum covering all services including SES for email delivery.

**Modern, Sustainable Architecture:** The platform is built on a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda, RDS PostgreSQL, S3, SQS, SES, and CloudFront. This approach eliminates server management overhead, scales automatically to handle peak loads (such as reporting deadline periods), and optimizes costs by charging only for actual usage. Infrastructure is defined as code using SST (infrastructure as code), enabling reproducible deployments, disaster recovery, and full audit trails of infrastructure changes. The technology stack (TanStack Start, React 19, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, and shadcn/ui) represents 2025 best practices for longevity, maintainability, and performance.

**Our Proposed Solution:**

The Solstice platform delivers a comprehensive information management system designed specifically for viaSport's requirements:

_Data Submission & Reporting Portal:_ A secure, responsive web portal with role-based dashboards for viaSport administrators, PSO reporters, and data stewards. The portal includes a customizable form builder, file upload capabilities, real-time submission tracking, and automated notifications. The interface is built on accessible Radix UI primitives and is tested for performance and usability (Lighthouse metrics available on request).

_Native Analytics Platform:_ Rather than integrating third-party tools such as Metabase or Superset, we built analytics directly into the platform to ensure every query respects tenancy boundaries, every export is audited, and every field-level permission is enforced. Users can build ad-hoc pivot tables and charts, export to CSV, Excel, or JSON, and access self-service analytics without developer intervention.

_Data Warehousing:_ PostgreSQL on AWS RDS provides the analytical backbone, with capacity tested at 20+ million rows and headroom to scale 10x or more. The architecture supports real-time data freshness without ETL delays, multi-AZ failover for high availability, and 35-day backup retention with quarterly disaster recovery drills.

_Migration Tooling:_ Production-ready import infrastructure handles CSV/Excel imports with configurable field mapping, validation rules, preview before commit, and rollback capabilities. Batch processing via AWS ECS Fargate supports large-scale imports with checkpointing for resumability. Migration methodology will be finalized collaboratively based on BCAR/BCSI system capabilities.

_Training & Onboarding:_ In-app guided walkthroughs, a searchable help center with categorized guides and FAQs, a centralized templates hub, and an integrated support request system with status tracking. All training content will be refined through UX interviews with viaSport stakeholders to ensure relevance to actual workflows.

**Proposed Timeline:**

We propose an 18-week implementation timeline from contract signing to full rollout:

| Phase                   | Duration | Milestone             |
| ----------------------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| Planning & Discovery    | 2 weeks  | Requirements sign-off |
| Development & Migration | 6 weeks  | Code complete         |
| User Acceptance Testing | 4 weeks  | UAT sign-off          |
| viaSport Training       | 2 weeks  | Soft launch           |
| PSO Rollout             | 4 weeks  | Full rollout          |

This accelerated timeline is possible because of the extensive prototyping work already completed. Remaining work is refinement, migration, and production hardening, not greenfield development. We acknowledge inherent project risks and commit to early, transparent communication if timeline adjustments become necessary.

**Team:**

| Role                         | Team Member       |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Project Lead / Data Engineer | Austin Wallace    |
| Senior Developer             | Will Siddal       |
| Security Expert              | TBD (in progress) |
| UX Designer                  | TBD (in progress) |

Austin Wallace, the architect and sole developer of the working prototype, will lead delivery directly. This principal-led approach ensures continuity from prototype through production, eliminates hand-off risk, and provides viaSport with direct access to the person who understands the system most deeply.

---

Austin Wallace Tech welcomes the opportunity to present the working prototype to viaSport and discuss how this solution can serve as the foundation for B.C. amateur sport's next decade of data-driven decision-making. We are prepared to participate in a virtual presentation and demonstration at viaSport's convenience.

# Service Approach: Data Submission and Reporting Web Portal

## UX Strategy and Approach

The Solstice platform is designed with a single guiding principle: make data submission intuitive and efficient for non-technical administrators. The platform serves three primary user groups, each with distinct needs:

| User Group              | Primary Tasks                           | UX Focus                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| viaSport Administrators | Oversight, analytics, compliance review | Cross-org dashboards, audit access, admin tools          |
| PSO Reporters           | Data submission, report tracking        | Streamlined forms, progress tracking, deadline awareness |
| Data Stewards           | Data quality, corrections, imports      | Validation tools, error resolution, bulk operations      |

### Role-Based Portal Design

Each user sees a personalized dashboard based on their role and organizational affiliation. The dashboard surfaces relevant actions, pending tasks, and submission status without requiring navigation through menus.

**Dashboard Elements by Role:**

- **Administrators:** Overdue submissions across organizations, pending access requests, system health indicators, analytics summaries.
- **Reporters:** Current submission status, upcoming deadlines, changes requested, recent activity.
- **Data Stewards:** Validation queues, import progress, data quality exceptions, bulk operations.

### Navigation and Workflow

The platform uses dashboard-led navigation with quick access cards for common tasks. Users can locate information through:

- **Command palette:** Keyboard-accessible search (Cmd/Ctrl+K) for instant navigation to any page, form, or record.
- **Contextual links:** Related actions appear alongside relevant data, reducing clicks to complete tasks.

### Responsive Design

The interface adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports. All core functionality is accessible on mobile devices, enabling PSO administrators to review and approve submissions while away from their desks.

### Accessibility

The interface is built on Radix UI primitives, which provide WCAG-compliant accessibility by default. This includes:

- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Focus indicators for interactive elements

Preliminary Lighthouse accessibility checks indicate strong compliance. A formal WCAG audit is available on request.

### UX Refinement Process

The current prototype provides a solid foundation. During the Planning phase, we will conduct UX interviews with viaSport stakeholders to:

- Validate navigation structure against actual workflows
- Identify pain points from legacy system usage
- Refine dashboard widgets to surface the most relevant information
- Apply viaSport branding and visual preferences

# Service Approach: Data Warehousing

## Hosting Solution, Tenancy Model, Data Residency, and Regulatory Alignment

### Hosting Solution

The platform is hosted entirely on Amazon Web Services (AWS), using a serverless architecture that eliminates infrastructure management overhead.

| Component        | AWS Service     | Purpose                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Application Tier | Lambda          | Serverless compute, auto-scaling        |
| Database         | RDS PostgreSQL  | Managed relational database             |
| Object Storage   | S3              | Documents, import files, audit archives |
| CDN              | CloudFront      | Edge caching, static asset delivery     |
| Message Queue    | SQS             | Asynchronous notification processing    |
| Email            | SES             | Transactional email delivery            |
| Scheduling       | EventBridge     | Cron jobs for automated tasks           |
| Secrets          | Secrets Manager | Credential storage                      |
| Encryption Keys  | KMS             | Key management for encryption at rest   |

### Data Residency

All data is hosted exclusively in AWS ca-central-1 (Montreal, Canada). No data is stored, processed, or transmitted outside Canadian jurisdiction.

| Data Type            | Storage Location        | Region       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ |
| Application database | RDS PostgreSQL          | ca-central-1 |
| Documents and files  | S3                      | ca-central-1 |
| Audit log archives   | S3 Glacier Deep Archive | ca-central-1 |
| Backups              | RDS automated backups   | ca-central-1 |

### Tenancy Model

The platform uses a multi-tenant architecture with organization-scoped access controls. All tenants share the same application infrastructure, but data isolation is enforced at the application layer:

- Every database query is scoped to the user's organization.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts actions based on user permissions.
- Field-level permissions control visibility of sensitive data elements.
- Cross-organization access requires explicit administrative privileges.

This model provides cost efficiency (shared infrastructure) while maintaining strict data isolation between organizations.

### Regulatory Alignment

| Requirement         | Implementation                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PIPEDA compliance   | Canadian data residency, encryption, access controls, audit logging |
| Data minimization   | Configurable retention policies, automated purging                  |
| Right to access     | User data export functionality                                      |
| Breach notification | Audit logging, anomaly detection, alerting                          |

AWS maintains a Data Processing Addendum (DPA) that covers all services used by the platform, including SES for email delivery. The DPA is available at: https://d1.awsstatic.com/legal/aws-dpa/aws-dpa.pdf

### Sub-Processors

| Service              | Provider | Purpose                   | Data Residency        |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Cloud Infrastructure | AWS      | Hosting, compute, storage | Canada (ca-central-1) |
| Email Delivery       | AWS SES  | Transactional emails      | Canada (ca-central-1) |

No additional sub-processors are used. All services are provided directly by AWS within Canadian jurisdiction.

## Backup, Recovery, and Encryption Standards

### Backup Strategy

| Parameter                | Value                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Backup frequency         | Continuous (point-in-time recovery)            |
| Backup retention         | 35 days                                        |
| Backup location          | AWS RDS automated backups, ca-central-1        |
| Cross-region replication | Not enabled (single-region for data residency) |

### Recovery Objectives

| Metric                         | Target  | Tested |
| ------------------------------ | ------- | ------ |
| Recovery Point Objective (RPO) | 1 hour  | Yes    |
| Recovery Time Objective (RTO)  | 4 hours | Yes    |

### High Availability

Production environment uses Multi-AZ deployment for automatic failover:

- Primary database instance in one Availability Zone
- Synchronous standby replica in a separate Availability Zone
- Automatic failover in case of primary instance failure
- No data loss during failover (synchronous replication)

### Disaster Recovery Testing

Disaster recovery drills are scheduled quarterly. The most recent drill on file confirmed:

- Point-in-time restore completed successfully
- Application reconnection automated
- RTO achieved within target (4 hours)
- No data loss observed

Evidence available: `/docs/sin-rfp/review-plans/evidence/DR-DRILL-sin-dev-20251230.md`

### Encryption Standards

**In Transit:**

| Protocol | Version | Scope                           |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| TLS      | 1.2+    | All client-server communication |
| TLS      | 1.2+    | All inter-service communication |

**At Rest:**

| Data Type  | Encryption Method | Key Management                  |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Database   | AES-256           | AWS KMS (customer-managed keys) |
| S3 objects | AES-256           | AWS KMS (customer-managed keys) |
| Backups    | AES-256           | AWS KMS (customer-managed keys) |

**Secrets Management:**

Application secrets (database credentials, API keys, authentication secrets) are stored in AWS Secrets Manager with automatic rotation capability.

### Audit Log Retention

| Log Type               | Retention Period | Storage Tier                                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Application audit logs | 7 years          | RDS (recent), S3 Glacier Deep Archive (archived) |
| Infrastructure logs    | 90 days          | CloudWatch Logs                                  |
| Access logs            | 90 days          | CloudWatch Logs                                  |

Audit logs are protected by a tamper-evident hash chain. Each log entry includes a hash of the previous entry, enabling detection of any modification or deletion.

### Why PostgreSQL (Not a Columnar Data Warehouse)

viaSport's data scale (20M historical rows, approximately 1M rows per year growth) is well within PostgreSQL's optimal range. A dedicated columnar warehouse such as Redshift or Snowflake would add unnecessary cost and complexity:

| Factor                        | PostgreSQL        | Columnar Warehouse          |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Optimal scale                 | Up to 500M+ rows  | Billions of rows            |
| viaSport projected (10 years) | 30M rows          | 30M rows                    |
| Operational complexity        | Low (managed RDS) | Higher (cluster management) |
| Estimated annual cost         | $3,000 to $6,000  | $12,000+ minimum            |
| Data freshness                | Real-time         | Requires ETL, often delayed |

PostgreSQL provides excellent analytical query performance at viaSport's scale while keeping data fresh (no ETL delays) and costs low. The architecture supports future migration to analytical extensions (TimescaleDB, DuckDB) if growth significantly exceeds projections.

# Service Approach: Platform Design and Customization

## Cloud Provider Services

### AWS Services

The platform is built entirely on Amazon Web Services, deployed in the ca-central-1 (Montreal) region for Canadian data residency.

| Service             | Purpose                                                                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CloudFront**      | Content delivery network for static assets and edge caching                 |
| **Lambda**          | Serverless application compute                                              |
| **RDS PostgreSQL**  | Managed relational database                                                 |
| **S3**              | Object storage for documents, imports, and audit archives                   |
| **SQS**             | Message queues for asynchronous notification processing                     |
| **SES**             | Transactional email delivery                                                |
| **EventBridge**     | Cron scheduling for automated jobs (retention, notifications, data quality) |
| **CloudWatch**      | Metrics, logs, and alarms                                                   |
| **CloudTrail**      | API audit logging                                                           |
| **GuardDuty**       | Threat detection                                                            |
| **Secrets Manager** | Credential storage with rotation                                            |
| **KMS**             | Encryption key management                                                   |

### Why AWS

| Factor           | Rationale                                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Canadian region  | ca-central-1 provides data residency compliance      |
| Serverless-first | Reduces operational burden, no server patching       |
| Mature services  | Battle-tested, well-documented, strong SLAs          |
| SST integration  | Infrastructure as Code tooling purpose-built for AWS |

### Why Serverless

The serverless architecture provides specific benefits for viaSport:

1. **No infrastructure management:** AWS handles server provisioning, patching, and scaling.
2. **Automatic scaling:** Application scales up during peak periods (reporting deadlines) and scales down during quiet periods.
3. **Cost efficiency:** Pay only for actual compute time, not idle capacity.
4. **High availability:** Lambda automatically distributes across multiple Availability Zones.

### Infrastructure as Code

All infrastructure is defined in TypeScript using SST (Serverless Stack). This approach provides:

| Benefit            | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reproducibility    | Any environment can be recreated from code                                    |
| Version control    | Infrastructure changes tracked in git alongside application code              |
| Audit trail        | Full history of what changed, when, and by whom                               |
| Disaster recovery  | Entire stack can be rebuilt from code if needed                               |
| Environment parity | Development, performance testing, and production use identical configurations |

## Development and Customization Process

### Environment Strategy

| Environment | Purpose                           | Infrastructure Tier                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| sin-dev     | Development and testing           | Minimal (t4g.micro, single-AZ)                    |
| sin-perf    | Performance testing, load testing | Production-like (t4g.large, 200GB)                |
| sin-prod    | Production                        | Full (t4g.large, 200GB, Multi-AZ, 35-day backups) |

Each environment is fully isolated with its own:

- Database instance
- S3 buckets
- Lambda functions
- Secrets
- Domain/URL

### Development Workflow

```
Developer writes code
        ↓
Pre-commit hooks run (lint, type check, format)
        ↓
Automated tests run
        ↓
Code review and merge
        ↓
Deploy to sin-dev (automatic)
        ↓
Deploy to sin-perf (manual, for load testing)
        ↓
Deploy to sin-prod (manual, after UAT sign-off)
```

### Quality Gates

Deployments are gated by standard quality checks:

| Gate          | Tooling                    | Purpose                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Linting       | Project linting rules      | Code style and error detection |
| Type checking | TypeScript                 | Compile-time error detection   |
| Formatting    | Project formatter          | Consistent code style          |
| Unit tests    | Automated unit tests       | Component and function testing |
| E2E tests     | Automated end-to-end tests | Full user flow testing         |

### Deployment Process

Deployments are executed using SST:

```
npx sst deploy --stage sin-prod
```

This single command:

1. Builds the application
2. Synthesizes infrastructure changes
3. Deploys Lambda functions
4. Updates database schema (if needed)
5. Invalidates CDN cache
6. Reports deployment status

### Rollback

If issues are discovered after deployment:

- Previous Lambda versions remain available for instant rollback
- Database migrations are versioned with rollback plans as needed
- SST maintains deployment history for reference

### Customization Capabilities

The platform supports customization without code changes:

| Customization         | Method                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Branding              | Tenant configuration (logo, colors, name)  |
| Forms                 | Form builder UI for custom data collection |
| Roles and permissions | Admin UI for role management               |
| Notifications         | Configurable notification templates        |
| Retention policies    | Admin-configurable retention periods       |

### Change Management

Changes to the production environment follow a defined process:

1. Change request submitted (by viaSport or development team)
2. Impact assessment (scope, risk, timeline)
3. Development and testing in sin-dev
4. Performance validation in sin-perf (if applicable)
5. UAT in sin-perf
6. Deployment to sin-prod
7. Post-deployment verification

Emergency changes (security patches, critical bug fixes) follow an expedited process with retrospective documentation.

# Service Approach: Testing and Quality Assurance

## QA Approach

### Testing Layers

The platform uses a multi-layer testing strategy to catch issues at different levels:

| Layer            | Tool                     | Purpose                                      | Frequency    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Unit/Integration | Vitest + Testing Library | Component and function testing               | Every commit |
| End-to-End       | Playwright               | Full user flow testing                       | Every commit |
| Property-Based   | Custom                   | Access control, audit integrity verification | Every commit |
| Performance      | Lighthouse, k6           | Load testing, Core Web Vitals                | Pre-release  |
| Security         | Manual + automated       | MFA, sessions, audit hash chain              | Pre-release  |

### Automated Testing

Automated tests run on commits and pull requests through the CI/CD pipeline. Merges are gated by passing tests where applicable.

**Test Coverage:**

- Unit tests for business logic and utility functions
- Integration tests for database operations and API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows (login, data submission, reporting)
- Property-based tests for access control rules (verifying users cannot access data outside their organization)

### Performance Testing

Performance testing is conducted in the sin-perf environment with production-scale data.

**Load Test Results (latest run; date TBD):**

| Metric              | Value             | Target           | Status   |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| Data volume         | 20.1 million rows | Production scale | Achieved |
| p95 latency         | 250ms             | <500ms           | Pass     |
| p50 latency         | 130ms             | N/A              | Pass     |
| Concurrent users    | 15                | N/A              | Pass     |
| Server errors (5xx) | 0                 | 0                | Pass     |

**Data Distribution:**

| Table                    | Rows  |
| ------------------------ | ----- |
| form_submissions         | 10.0M |
| audit_logs               | 7.0M  |
| notifications            | 2.0M  |
| bi_query_log             | 1.0M  |
| form_submission_versions | 0.1M  |

The platform handles 20 million rows with sub-250ms response times and zero server errors under concurrent load.

**Core Web Vitals (Lighthouse, latest prototype run; date TBD):**

| Metric                   | Value  | Target  | Status |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------- | ------ |
| Performance Score        | 93/100 | >80     | Pass   |
| Largest Contentful Paint | 2284ms | <2500ms | Pass   |
| Time to First Byte       | 380ms  | <500ms  | Pass   |
| Total Blocking Time      | 88ms   | <300ms  | Pass   |
| Cumulative Layout Shift  | 0      | <0.1    | Pass   |

### Security Testing

Security testing validates the platform's protection mechanisms:

| Area               | Testing Approach                                    |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Authentication     | MFA flow validation (TOTP, backup codes)            |
| Session management | Session expiry, concurrent session limits           |
| Access control     | Role-based access enforcement, organization scoping |
| Audit integrity    | Hash chain verification, tamper detection           |
| Anomaly detection  | Login pattern analysis, account lock triggers       |

Security testing is conducted before each release and after any changes to authentication or authorization logic.

### Defect Management

Defects discovered during testing are classified by severity:

| Severity | Definition                             | Response Time |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Critical | Security vulnerability, data loss risk | Immediate     |
| High     | Core functionality broken              | Same day      |
| Medium   | Non-critical functionality affected    | Within sprint |
| Low      | Cosmetic or minor UX issues            | Backlog       |

Defects will be tracked in a shared ticketing system accessible to viaSport.

## User Acceptance Testing Strategy

### UAT Approach

User Acceptance Testing validates that the platform meets viaSport's requirements from the user's perspective. Our UAT approach emphasizes collaboration and early feedback:

| Element       | Approach                                                   |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Environment   | Dedicated sin-perf environment with production-like data   |
| Access        | viaSport testers receive accounts with appropriate roles   |
| Visibility    | Test scenarios mapped to requirements, progress tracked    |
| Communication | Weekly demos, immediate platform access, visible ticketing |

### UAT Timeline

UAT is scheduled for 4 weeks during the implementation timeline:

| Week   | Focus                                                   |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Week 1 | Core workflows: login, navigation, data submission      |
| Week 2 | Reporting and analytics: dashboards, exports, queries   |
| Week 3 | Administration: user management, configuration, imports |
| Week 4 | Edge cases, regression testing, sign-off preparation    |

### Test Scenarios

Test scenarios are structured around the System Requirements Addendum:

**Key Differentiator: Native BI Platform**

Rather than integrating a third-party analytics tool such as Metabase or Superset, we built analytics directly into the platform. This approach was chosen after evaluating external tools against viaSport's governance requirements:

| Requirement             | External Tools                          | Native BI                           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Tenancy Enforcement     | Requires custom RLS/views per tenant    | Built into query layer              |
| Field-Level Access      | Complex configuration, often bypassed   | Enforced at query time              |
| Audit Logging           | Limited or paid-tier only               | Full integration with audit chain   |
| Canadian Data Residency | Extra configuration for build pipelines | Guaranteed (ca-central-1)           |
| Export Controls         | Often disabled or hard to audit         | Audited with step-up authentication |

This native approach ensures every query respects tenancy boundaries, every export is audited, and every field-level permission is enforced without the complexity and security gaps of integrating external tools.

**Evidence:** BI platform functional in prototype; users can build pivot tables and export data with access controls enforced.

## Case Studies

### Primary: Solstice Platform (for viaSport)

**Context:** viaSport issued an RFP to replace legacy information management systems (BCAR and BCSI) serving 60+ Provincial Sport Organizations. The RFP specified 25 system requirements across data management, reporting, security, training, and user interface.

**Approach:** Rather than responding with a proposal document, Austin Wallace Tech built a working prototype that demonstrates capability through a functioning system.

**Deliverables:**

| Component               | Description                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Submission Portal  | Form builder, file uploads, submission tracking, version history        |
| Native BI Platform      | Pivot tables, charts, export to CSV/Excel/JSON with tenancy enforcement |
| Role-Based Access       | Organization-scoped permissions, field-level access control             |
| Security Infrastructure | MFA, anomaly detection, tamper-evident audit logs                       |
| Import Tooling          | CSV/Excel import with mapping, validation, preview, rollback            |
| Training Framework      | Guided walkthroughs, help center, templates hub                         |

**Results:**

- Majority of system requirements addressed; remaining items scheduled in the implementation plan

The platform includes comprehensive automation for operational efficiency:

| Feature                 | Schedule        | Purpose                                                            |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Scheduled Notifications | Every 5 minutes | Process queued notifications, send email digests                   |
| Retention Enforcement   | Daily           | Purge data past retention period, archive audit logs to S3 Glacier |
| Data Quality Monitor    | Daily           | Scan submissions for completeness, flag data quality issues        |
| Notification Queue      | Event-driven    | Asynchronous email delivery with retry and dead-letter queue       |
| Batch Import Worker     | On-demand       | Process large CSV/Excel imports via ECS Fargate with checkpointing |
| Health Monitoring       | On-demand       | Database and service health checks with alerting                   |
| Audit Logging           | Real-time       | Immutable logging of all system actions                            |

**Technical Infrastructure:**

| Service         | Purpose                                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |

| AWS Lambda      | Serverless job execution                           |
| AWS SQS FIFO    | Notification queue with deduplication              |
| AWS ECS Fargate | Batch processing (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM, checkpointing) |
| AWS SES         | Email delivery with bounce handling                |
| AWS CloudWatch  | Metrics, alarms, and centralized logging           |

### AI Features (Roadmap)

The platform architecture is AI-ready, with specific features to be prioritized in collaboration with viaSport during the Planning phase.

**Proposed AI Features for Year 1:**

| Feature                | Description                                                 | Benefit                                        |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| AI Report Narratives   | Generate board-ready summaries from submitted data          | Reduce manual report writing                   |
| Natural Language Query | Ask questions about data in plain English                   | Self-service analytics for non-technical users |
| Data Quality AI        | Automatically detect anomalies and errors in submissions    | Improve data integrity                         |
| Submission Assistant   | Help PSOs complete forms correctly with contextual guidance | Reduce errors and support requests             |

**Why AI is Roadmap, Not Day-One:**

The RFP identifies AI-enabled features as desirable, not required. Our approach prioritizes:

1. Delivering core functionality first
2. Gathering real usage data to inform AI priorities
3. Collaborating with viaSport to identify highest-value AI applications
4. Implementing AI features with proper validation and testing

Austin Wallace's experience at Clio (authored company-wide AI best practices, achieved 20x increase in responsible AI adoption) informs this measured approach.

## Responsible AI Approach

When AI features are implemented, the following principles will govern their development and deployment:

### Transparency

- Clear indication when AI generates or assists with content
- Explanation of AI confidence levels where applicable
- Documentation of AI model sources and capabilities

### Human-in-the-Loop

- AI-generated reports require human review before publication
- AI suggestions are recommendations, not automatic actions
- Users can override or reject AI outputs

### Privacy Protection

- AI models do not train on viaSport data without explicit consent
- PII is excluded from AI processing where not essential
- AI features respect the same access controls as the rest of the platform

### Bias Awareness

- Regular review of AI outputs for unintended patterns
- Diverse test cases during AI feature development
- Feedback mechanisms for users to flag problematic outputs

## Open Standards, APIs, and Open Source

### Open Standards

| Standard        | Usage                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| TOTP (RFC 6238) | Multi-factor authentication    |
| CSV/Excel       | Data import and export formats |
| JSON            | Data interchange               |
| TLS 1.2+        | Transport security             |
| AES-256         | Encryption at rest             |

### APIs

The platform provides internal APIs and integration points. External APIs and webhooks can be exposed as needed and scoped collaboratively with viaSport during Planning.

**Note:** Integration requirements (e.g., third-party databases or services) will be defined with viaSport before implementation.

### Open Source

The platform is built on industry-standard open source technologies:

| Layer          | Technologies                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Frontend       | React 19, TanStack Start, TypeScript, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS |
| Backend        | TanStack Start, Node.js, Drizzle ORM                         |
| Database       | PostgreSQL                                                   |
| Infrastructure | SST (infrastructure as code)                                 |
| Testing        | Vitest, Playwright, Testing Library                          |
| Validation     | Zod                                                          |

This open source foundation ensures:

- **No vendor lock-in** for core technologies
- **Community support** and ongoing development
- **Auditability** of underlying code
- **Portability** if future migration is needed
- **Talent availability** for future development

The application code itself is proprietary, owned by Austin Wallace Tech, with full source code access provided to viaSport as part of the engagement.

# Cost and Value of Services

## Pricing Model Overview

Austin Wallace Tech proposes a fixed-price engagement with transparent pricing and milestone-based payments.

| Component         | Amount   | Period   |
| ----------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Implementation    | $600,000 | One-time |
| Annual Operations | $200,000 | Per year |

**Year 1 Total:** $800,000
**Year 2+ Total:** $200,000 per year

This pricing reflects the value delivered to viaSport, not cost-plus billing. The working prototype significantly de-risks this engagement: viaSport is paying for a proven solution adapted to their needs, not greenfield development.

## Cost Breakdown

### Implementation ($600,000)

| Phase                   | Activities                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Planning & Discovery    | Requirements validation, UX interviews, migration planning        |
| Development             | Remaining feature work, viaSport-specific configuration, branding |
| Data Migration          | Legacy data extraction, mapping, validation, import               |
| User Acceptance Testing | UAT environment, test support, defect resolution                  |
| Training                | viaSport administrator training, train-the-trainer sessions       |
| PSO Rollout             | Cohort-based PSO onboarding, go-live support                      |
| Production Deployment   | Production environment configuration, monitoring setup            |

All RFP requirements (DM-AGG, RP-AGG, SEC-AGG, TO-AGG, UI-AGG) are included, including completion of the remaining gaps identified in this draft.

### Annual Operations ($200,000/year)

| Category                 | Scope                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hosting & Infrastructure | AWS ca-central-1, Multi-AZ database, CDN, storage, compute       |
| Security                 | Ongoing monitoring, security patches, quarterly security reviews |
| Maintenance              | Bug fixes, dependency updates, performance optimization          |
| Support                  | Business hours support (24h response standard, 4h critical)      |
| Minor Enhancements       | Small improvements within existing feature scope                 |
| Disaster Recovery        | Maintained backups, quarterly DR drills                          |

### Payment Schedule

| Milestone        | Percentage | Amount   | Trigger                          |
| ---------------- | ---------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| Contract Signing | 25%        | $150,000 | Signed agreement                 |
| UAT Sign-Off     | 25%        | $150,000 | User acceptance testing complete |
| Go-Live          | 50%        | $300,000 | Production deployment            |

Annual operations billed quarterly in advance ($50,000 per quarter).

## Factors Affecting Timeline and Price

### Scope Changes

Changes to scope beyond the RFP requirements would trigger a change order process:

| Change Type                  | Process                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| New features not in RFP      | Scope assessment, proposal, mutual agreement          |
| Additional integrations      | Integration specification, impact assessment, pricing |
| Major infrastructure changes | Architecture review, proposal with options            |

The change management process ensures no work begins without mutual agreement on scope, timeline, and cost.

### Change Management Process

1. Change request submitted (by either party)
2. Impact assessment (scope, timeline, cost implications)
3. Proposal with options presented
4. Mutual agreement documented
5. Work proceeds only after sign-off

### Factors That Would NOT Trigger Price Adjustments

- Normal data volume growth within PostgreSQL capacity (tested to 20M+ rows, with headroom for projected growth)
- Reasonable support request volume
- Standard security updates and patches
- Configuration changes within existing features

## Optional Add-Ons

### Operations Portal (Events & Team Management)

**Estimated:** $50,000 to $100,000 implementation, plus ongoing support

The Solstice platform includes an operations portal (currently deployed for Quadball Canada) that enables event registration, team management, and membership features. This could be extended to viaSport and PSOs.

**Potential Value:**

- Single source of truth: reporting and operations in one system
- Reduced duplicate data entry for PSOs
- Better analytics: participation data linked to reporting
- Faster compliance: reporting validated against real event data

**Considerations:**

- Expands user base beyond reporters (players, parents, club admins)
- Increases support volume
- Requires scoping discussion to define exact requirements

This is offered as an option, not included in the base proposal.

### Extended Support Coverage (24/7)

**Estimated:** $30,000 to $50,000 per year additional

Standard support covers business hours (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm Pacific). Extended coverage would add:

- After-hours monitoring and response
- Critical issue escalation outside business hours
- Weekend and holiday coverage

This would be delivered via subcontractor arrangement.

## In-Kind and Value-Add Contributions

### Value-Add: Working Prototype

The most significant value-add is the working prototype itself. Rather than proposing to build a system, Austin Wallace Tech has already built one:

- 20,000+ lines of tested TypeScript
- Majority of system requirements addressed; remaining items scheduled in the implementation plan
- Load tested with 20.1 million rows
- Available for viaSport evaluation before contract signing

This represents substantial pre-investment that de-risks the engagement for viaSport.

### Value-Add: Source Code Access

Source code access can be provided under mutually agreed terms (e.g., escrow or direct access). This supports:

- Transparency: viaSport can audit the code at any time
- Continuity: If the engagement ends, viaSport retains access to the codebase
- Flexibility: Future development can be performed by any qualified team

### Pricing Philosophy

This pricing represents our best honest value. We do not inflate prices to offer discounts during negotiation. The figures above reflect:

- Efficient modern development practices
- Substantial pre-built functionality (prototype)
- Lean team without enterprise overhead
- Value-based pricing tied to outcomes, not hourly billing

Traditional government IT projects of comparable scope often run $1 to $2 million or more. Our pricing reflects the efficiency of a working prototype and a principal-led delivery model.

| Planning & Discovery    | 2 weeks  | UX interviews, requirements refinement, migration discovery | Requirements Sign-Off |
| Development & Migration | 6 weeks  | Feature refinement, viaSport configuration, data migration  | Code Complete         |
| User Acceptance Testing | 4 weeks  | viaSport testing, defect resolution, acceptance sign-off    | UAT Sign-Off          |
| viaSport Training       | 2 weeks  | Admin training, documentation handoff, support preparation  | Soft Launch           |
| PSO Rollout             | 4 weeks  | PSO onboarding, tiered training, support ramp-up            | Full Rollout          |

**Total Duration:** 18 weeks

### Why This Timeline is Achievable

Traditional information management system implementations of this scope typically require 24 to 36 weeks. Our accelerated timeline is possible because the working prototype already addresses the majority of system requirements:

| Traditional Phase         | Status        | Remaining Work                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Architecture              | Complete      | None                                 |
| Authentication & Security | Complete      | Production hardening                 |
| Core Features             | ~90% complete | UX refinements per viaSport feedback |
| Analytics Platform        | Complete      | None                                 |
| Migration Tooling         | Complete      | Extraction depends on legacy systems |

Remaining work is refinement and migration, not greenfield development.

## Risks, Assumptions, and Dependencies

### Dependencies on viaSport

The proposed timeline assumes prompt collaboration from viaSport on:

| Dependency         | Timing      | Impact if Delayed                   |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Legacy data access | Week 1      | Migration timeline at risk          |
| Brand assets       | Week 2      | Branding work delayed               |
| SME availability   | Weeks 1-2   | UX refinements based on assumptions |
| UAT testers        | Weeks 9-12  | UAT duration extended               |
| PSO coordination   | Weeks 15-18 | Rollout schedule impacted           |

### Assumptions

- viaSport can provide export capability or schema documentation for BCAR/BCSI
- viaSport staff are available for scheduled interviews and reviews
- No major scope changes after requirements sign-off
- PSOs are responsive to onboarding communications

### Risk Register

| Risk                       | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Legacy data access delayed | Medium     | High   | Begin migration discovery in Week 1; escalate early           |
| Data quality issues        | Medium     | Medium | Validation tooling built in; budget time in Development phase |
| viaSport SME availability  | Low        | Medium | Schedule interviews early; provide async options              |
| Scope creep                | Low        | High   | Weekly check-ins; formal change request process               |
| PSO adoption resistance    | Low        | Medium | Train-the-trainer approach; viaSport champions                |

### Timeline Commitment

This timeline represents our realistic assessment based on the working prototype and assumed collaboration. We acknowledge that external factors (data quality, legacy system access, stakeholder availability) could impact delivery.

We commit to:

- Early identification of risks and blockers
- Transparent communication if timeline adjustments become necessary
- Collaborative problem-solving to maintain schedule where possible

The working prototype significantly de-risks technical delivery. Remaining work is refinement and migration, not building from scratch.
