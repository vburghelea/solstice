# RFP Response Assembly Instructions

## Context

I am responding to the viaSport SIN RFP and want to assemble the first draft of the response. Explicit placeholders are acceptable at this stage.

## Source Files

- **`final.md`** - Current draft of each section, based on my austin-notes (not included in this bundle)
- **`update-notes.md`** - Agent-generated suggestions for updates based on current state of the codebase; these were created after final.md and may contain improvements or corrections
- **`example-rfp-sample.md`** - Sample excerpts from a real RFP response; use this as a reference for tone and style
- **`initial-template-rfp-response.md`** - Loose template for the response structure; can be modified as needed
- **`VIASPORT-PROVIDED-viasport-sin-rfp.md`** - The original RFP we are responding to
- **`VIASPORT-PROVIDED-system-requirements-addendum.md`** - Additional system requirements from viaSport

## Key Requirements

1. **Match the tone and style** of the example-rfp-sample.md - professional, detailed, confident but not boastful

2. **For sections corresponding to RFP requirements**, structure each as:
   - **The Requirement** - Copy of the original requirement from the RFP
   - **Our Response** - Our answer addressing the requirement
   - **Current State** - Where the feature/capability is at now
   - **Delivery Plan** - Our plan for where it will be once delivered

3. **Incorporate update-notes.md suggestions** where they improve upon the final.md content

4. **Use placeholders** where specific details are still needed (e.g., `[PLACEHOLDER: specific metric]`, `[TODO: confirm with team]`)

## Output

Assemble a cohesive first draft of the complete RFP response, organized according to the template structure but adapted as needed to best address the viaSport requirements.
