## Overview and Background

viaSport BC Society (viaSport) is an independent not-for-profit organization and a legacy entity of the Vancouver 2010 Olympics and Paralympic Games, operating as the provincial government's lead agency responsible for promoting and developing amateur sport in British Columbia.

For 15+ years viaSport has collected, stored and analyzed a substantial part of BC's amateur sport sector data, enabling informed decision-making, policy development and strategic planning.

Created over a decade ago, viaSport's information management systems are outdated and no longer meet the sport sector's fast-evolving information needs.

viaSport is seeking an experienced technology partner to design, implement, and support a modern, secure, and scalable solution that will transform how British Columbia's amateur sport sector captures, shares, and leverages information – setting a robust digital foundation for the province's next decade of sport development.

viaSport invites technology partners to propose innovative and integrated solutions that advance our reporting, analytics and information-sharing capabilities. Ideal submissions will demonstrate an integrated information ecosystem with automated and advanced analytics, including potential AI-enabled features. We welcome creative solutions that empower users, break down silos, and promote collaboration across the B.C. amateur sports sector.

viaSport welcomes responses from a range of partners, including product companies, data and analytics firms, research and innovation labs, and consortia that combine technology, data science, and sector expertise. Proposals that responsibly leverage open-source technologies, open standards, and interoperable APIs are accepted where they strengthen sustainability, transparency, and sector-wide value.

Beyond replacing legacy systems, this project is an opportunity to create a foundational digital layer for amateur sport in B.C. – a shared data and information platform that will shape how participation, funding, equity, and impact are understood for years to come. We are seeking a partner who can help viaSport responsibly embrace modern data management, interoperable APIs, automation, and AI-enabled insights. The goal is to move from static reports to living, trusted data assets that can power future programs, applications, and innovations across the entire sport ecosystem.
