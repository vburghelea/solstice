# Worklog — Stream K - Documentation, requirements, and evidence alignment

## Instructions

- Use `docs/sin-rfp/5.2-pro-review-output/consolidated-backlog.md` (Stream K - Documentation, requirements, and evidence alignment) as the source of truth.
- Keep this log updated during implementation and link any new ADRs.
- Follow TanStack Start server-only import patterns.
- Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check-types` before completing large task batches.
- Use Playwright MCP for UI verification when applicable.

## Scope (from consolidated backlog)

- [ ] K1 Update docs/sin-rfp/route-tree-implementation-review.md with per-item
      status and evidence links.
- [ ] K2 Update docs/sin-rfp/tickets/SIN-IMPLEMENTATION-BACKLOG-V2.md security
      controls table to reflect current implementation and evidence.
- [ ] K3 Add docs/sin-rfp/requirements-coverage-matrix.md mapping requirements
      to modules, tests, and evidence.
- [ ] K4 Add implementation-status callouts in Phase 0 docs to distinguish
      planned vs implemented items.
