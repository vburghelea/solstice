This file contains a packed representation of the entire repository's contents.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.
</purpose>

<file_format>
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  - File path as an attribute
  - Full contents of the file
</file_format>

<usage_guidelines>
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.
</usage_guidelines>

<notes>
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
- Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded
- Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)

description: Building or using forms
globs: 
alwaysApply: false

1.  **Custom Form Hook (`createFormHook`):**
    *   Define a single, project-wide custom hook (e.g., `useAppForm`) using `createFormHook`.
    *   Configure this hook with reusable field components (`fieldComponents`) based on our Shadcn UI library (e.g., wrappers around `Input`, `Select`, `Checkbox`).
    *   Configure form-level components (`formComponents`) like a standard `SubmitButton`.
    *   This centralizes form setup, enhances type safety, and reduces boilerplate in individual form implementations.
    *   Reference: [Quick Start](https://tanstack.com/form/latest/docs/framework/react/quick-start), [Philosophy](https://tanstack.com/form/latest/docs/philosophy)

2.  **Type Safety via Inference:**
    *   **Do not** use explicit generics like `useForm<MyFormData>()`.
    *   **Do** provide strongly-typed `defaultValues` to `useAppForm`. TanStack Form will infer the types for the form state, fields, and values.
    *   Reference: [Philosophy](https://tanstack.com/form/latest/docs/philosophy)

3.  **Reusable Field Components:**
    *   Create dedicated React components that wrap our standard UI elements (e.g., `ValidatedInput`, `ValidatedSelect`).
    *   These components should accept a `field` prop (from TanStack Form) and handle displaying values, errors, and wiring up `onChange`, `onBlur`, etc.
    *   Register these components in the `fieldComponents` option of `createFormHook`.

4.  **Validation (Zod Recommended):**
    *   Use a schema library like Zod for validation.
    *   Pass the Zod schema to the `validators` option (e.g., `onChange`, `onSubmit`) in `useAppForm`. Field-level validation functions are also possible but schema-based is preferred for consistency.
    *   Reference: [Quick Start](https://tanstack.com/form/latest/docs/framework/react/quick-start)

5.  **Form Construction:**
    *   Use the components provided by the custom hook instance (e.g., `form.AppField`, `form.AppForm`) to build forms.
    *   `form.AppField` takes a `name` (which is type-checked against `defaultValues`) and a `children` render prop that receives the `field` API.
    *   Pass the appropriate reusable field component within the `children` prop (e.g., `<field.ValidatedInput />`).
    *   Reference: [Quick Start](https://tanstack.com/form/latest/docs/framework/react/quick-start)

**Implementation Strategy:**

We should implement the foundational pieces first:
1.  Define the `createFormHook` setup in a shared location (e.g., `src/lib/form.ts`).
2.  Create the necessary reusable field components that integrate with Shadcn UI and the TanStack Form `field` API.
3.  Then, individual forms can import and use `useAppForm` and the associated components (`form.AppField`, etc.).

# Security Configuration

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Solstice application.

## Overview

The application implements multiple layers of security:

1. **Security Headers** - Applied via Netlify Edge Functions
2. **Secure Cookie Configuration** - Enhanced Better Auth settings
3. **Rate Limiting** - Protection against brute force attacks
4. **Password Validation** - Strong password requirements
5. **Content Security Policy (CSP)** - Protection against XSS attacks

## Security Headers

Security headers are automatically applied to all responses via a Netlify Edge Function located at `netlify/edge-functions/security-headers.ts`.

### Applied Headers:

- **Content-Security-Policy**: Restricts resource loading with nonce-based script validation
- **X-Frame-Options**: DENY - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: nosniff - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy**: strict-origin-when-cross-origin - Controls referrer information
- **X-XSS-Protection**: 1; mode=block - Legacy XSS protection
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts browser features
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS with preloading

## Cookie Configuration

Better Auth cookies are configured with enhanced security settings:

```typescript
{
  secure: true,              // HTTPS only in production
  sameSite: "lax",          // CSRF protection
  httpOnly: true,           // No JavaScript access
  path: "/",                // Available site-wide
  domain: process.env.COOKIE_DOMAIN // Optional domain restriction
}
```

## Rate Limiting

The application implements rate limiting for sensitive endpoints:

### Auth Endpoints

- **Window**: 15 minutes
- **Max Requests**: 5 per window
- **Endpoints**: Login, registration, password reset

### API Endpoints

- **Window**: 15 minutes
- **Max Requests**: 100 per window
- **Endpoints**: All API routes

Usage example:

```typescript
import { rateLimit, getClientIp } from "~/lib/security";

// In your API route
const clientIp = getClientIp(request.headers);
await rateLimit("auth", clientIp);
```

## Password Requirements

Strong password validation is enforced:

- **Minimum Length**: 8 characters
- **Required**: Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- **Strength Meter**: 0-5 scale for user feedback

Usage example:

```typescript
import { validatePassword, getPasswordStrength } from "~/lib/security";

const result = validatePassword(password);
if (!result.isValid) {
  // Show errors to user
  console.error(result.errors);
}

const strength = getPasswordStrength(password);
// Display strength indicator
```

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

The CSP is configured to:

- Allow self-hosted resources by default
- Use nonces for inline scripts
- Allow specific external resources (Google Fonts, OAuth providers)
- Block unsafe inline styles (except where necessary)
- Prevent object/embed elements
- Enforce HTTPS upgrades

### Nonce Implementation

The edge function automatically:

1. Generates a unique nonce for each request
2. Injects the nonce into all script tags
3. Includes the nonce in the CSP header

## Environment Variables

Add these optional security-related environment variables:

```env
# Cookie domain restriction (optional)
COOKIE_DOMAIN=.yourdomain.com

# OAuth allowed email domains (comma-separated)
OAUTH_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=yourdomain.com,trusted-partner.com
```

## Development vs Production

Security features that differ between environments:

### Development

- Cookies use HTTP (not HTTPS-only)
- Email verification not required
- CSP may be more permissive

### Production

- Cookies are HTTPS-only
- Email verification required
- Strict CSP enforcement
- HSTS header with preloading

## Testing Security

1. **Headers**: Use browser dev tools or `curl -I https://yoursite.com`
2. **CSP**: Check browser console for violations
3. **Cookies**: Inspect in browser dev tools
4. **Rate Limiting**: Test with rapid requests
5. **Password Validation**: Test with various password combinations

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:

1. **Redis-based Rate Limiting** - For distributed deployments
2. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** - Additional protection layer
3. **Security Monitoring** - Log and alert on security events
4. **2FA/MFA** - Two-factor authentication
5. **API Key Management** - For service-to-service auth

# Testing Guide

This directory contains the testing infrastructure for Solstice, using Vitest as the test runner.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests once
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with UI
pnpm test:ui

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

## Test Structure

- `setup.ts` - Global test setup and configuration
- `utils.tsx` - Common test utilities and custom render functions
- `mocks/` - Shared mocks for testing

## Writing Tests

### Component Tests

Use the custom `render` function from `~/tests/utils` which includes providers:

```tsx
import { render, screen } from "~/tests/utils";
import { Button } from "~/shared/ui/button";

describe("Button", () => {
  it("renders correctly", () => {
    render(<Button>Click me</Button>);
    expect(screen.getByRole("button")).toHaveText("Click me");
  });
});
```

### Testing with Auth

Use the auth mocks for testing authenticated features:

```tsx
import { createAuthMocks } from "~/tests/mocks/auth";

const { mockUser, mockSession } = createAuthMocks();
```

### Server Function Tests

Test server-side logic in isolation:

```ts
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";

describe("Server Function", () => {
  it("processes data correctly", () => {
    const result = myServerFunction(input);
    expect(result).toEqual(expected);
  });
});
```

## Test Environment

- Environment: jsdom (for browser-like testing)
- Test framework: Vitest
- Testing libraries: @testing-library/react, @testing-library/user-event
- Assertion library: @testing-library/jest-dom

## Coverage

Coverage reports are generated in the `coverage/` directory. View the HTML report by opening `coverage/index.html` in your browser.

## Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on other tests
2. **Mocking**: Mock external dependencies and API calls
3. **User-centric**: Test from the user's perspective using Testing Library queries
4. **Async handling**: Use `waitFor` for async operations
5. **Cleanup**: Tests automatically cleanup after each test via the setup file

# Solstice Project Rules

## Dependencies
- Use `pnpm dlx taze@latest --interactive --group` to check for dependency updates
- Always review breaking changes before updating major versions
- Test thoroughly after dependency updates

## Environment Variables
- All environment variables are validated using @t3-oss/env-core and zod
- Server-side env vars are defined in `src/lib/env.server.ts`
- Client-side env vars are defined in `src/lib/env.client.ts`
- Always add new env vars to the appropriate schema with proper validation

## Code Quality
- Use TypeScript strictly - no `any` types
- Follow the existing code patterns and file organization
- Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check-types` before committing
- Write tests for new features using Vitest

## Tech Stack
- TanStack Start (React meta-framework)
- Better Auth for authentication
- Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- Tailwind CSS v4 with shadcn/ui components
- Vite 7+ (requires Node.js 20.19+)
- Netlify for deployment

# 🚀 Solstice – Full-Stack Development Guide

Welcome to the Solstice project! This guide teaches modern full-stack web development through a real-world application while serving as a complete technical reference.

## 🎯 What is Full-Stack Development?

Full-stack development means building both the **frontend** (what users see) and **backend** (server logic and data) of a web application. Think of it like building a restaurant:

- **Frontend**: The dining room, menu, and presentation
- **Backend**: The kitchen, recipes, and ingredient storage
- **Database**: The pantry and inventory system
- **Deployment**: The actual restaurant building and location

## 🏗️ Core Principles & Architecture

### Design Principles

| Principle                   | In Practice                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **End-to-End Type Safety**  | Shared types, strict `tsconfig`, generated route & schema types                |
| **Feature-Based Structure** | All code for a feature (UI, tests, logic) lives together                       |
| **Server/Client Isolation** | `serverOnly()` wrapper and env modules prevent accidental bundle leaks         |
| **Security by Default**     | Secure cookies, CSP, rate limiting, password strength checks—all on by default |
| **Automated Confidence**    | CI runs lint, type-check, tests, build; Husky guards commits                   |

### High-Level Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB;
  subgraph Browser["Browser (Client)"]
    UI["React UI / TanStack Start SSR"]
    Store["React Query (Cache)"]
    AuthClient["Better Auth JS"]
  end

  subgraph Edge["Netlify Edge"]
    EdgeFn["Edge Functions (Security Headers)"]
  end

  subgraph Server["Application Server"]
    Router["TanStack Router"]
    API["API Routes"]
    AuthSrv["Better Auth Middleware"]
  end

  subgraph DB["Neon PostgreSQL"]
    Pg[(Postgres)]
  end

  UI -->|HTTPS| EdgeFn
  EdgeFn --> Router
  Store <--> UI
  AuthClient <--> UI

  Router --> API
  API --> AuthSrv
  AuthSrv --> Pg
  Router --> Pg

  AuthClient -->|OAuth| AuthSrv
```

_Figure 1: High-level architecture showing request flow from browser to database._

Let's understand each component in the architecture:

**Browser Layer:**

- **React UI**: Your application's interface, server-side rendered by TanStack Start for fast initial loads
- **React Query**: Manages client-side state and caches server data to minimize unnecessary requests
- **Better Auth JS**: Handles authentication state and OAuth flows on the client side

**Edge Layer:**

- **Edge Functions**: Netlify runs these at the CDN edge to add security headers before content reaches users

**Application Server:**

- **TanStack Router**: File-based routing that maps your `src/routes/` files to URLs
- **API Routes**: Type-safe endpoints defined in `src/routes/api/` that handle data operations
- **Better Auth Middleware**: Protects routes and validates sessions on every request

**Database:**

- **Neon PostgreSQL**: Serverless Postgres that scales automatically and provides connection pooling

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

| Layer               | Library / Tool               | Why                                                          | Think of it as                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Runtime**         | React 19, TanStack Start     | File-based routing with first-class data loaders             | The foundation and walls of your house      |
| **Auth**            | Better Auth                  | Unified email/password + OAuth with serverless support       | The security system and door locks          |

## 🔧 Key Modules Explained

### Environment Management (`src/lib/env.*.ts`)

- Two Zod-backed schemas: one for server (`env.server.ts`), one for client (`env.client.ts`)
- Validation happens **before** anything else runs; unsafe access crashes fast
- All env vars are typed and validated

### Database Layer (`src/db`)

- **Schema**: All tables live in `schema/` files using Drizzle's fluent API
- **Connections**: `connections.ts` exposes:
  - `pooledDb()` for serverless handlers
  - `unpooledDb()` for migrations/scripts
  - `getDb()` which auto-selects based on environment

### Authentication (`src/lib/auth`)

- **Server side**: Lazy-initialized Better Auth instance with Drizzle adapter
- **Client side**: Small facade that lazy-loads the Better Auth React client

### Routing

- Page routes live in `src/routes/`
- Use `createFileRoute` (client) or `createAPIFileRoute` (API)
- `routeTree.gen.ts` is auto-generated—**never edit by hand**
- Use `beforeLoad` for server-side protection

### Forms (`src/lib/form.ts`)

- Single `useAppForm` hook wraps TanStack Form
- Registers common field components (`ValidatedInput`, etc.)
- Always supply typed `defaultValues`; generics are inferred

## 💻 Development Workflow

### Setup

1. **Install prerequisites**: Node 20+, pnpm, Docker
2. `pnpm install`
3. Copy `.env.example` → `.env` and fill values
4. `docker-compose up -d` (local Postgres)
5. `pnpm db:push` (creates tables)
6. `pnpm dev` – Starts development server

### Common Commands

| Task                 | Command                | Description                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Start dev server** | `pnpm dev`             | Runs app locally on port 3000 |
| **Run tests**        | `pnpm test`            | Executes all test suites      |
| **Type check**       | `pnpm check-types`     | Verifies TypeScript types     |
| **Lint code**        | `pnpm lint`            | Checks code style             |
| **Build app**        | `pnpm build`           | Creates production build      |
| **Start database**   | `docker-compose up -d` | Runs PostgreSQL locally       |
| **Push schema**      | `pnpm db:push`         | Updates database schema       |

### TypeScript Practices

| Rule                 | Example                                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Prefer inference     | `const user = await db.select()` – no manual generics |
| `any` is banned      | `tsconfig` sets `strict` and `noImplicitAny`          |
| Narrow errors        | Use custom error shapes in handlers                   |
| Keep helpers generic | `cn()` utility accepts any `ClassValue` union         |

## 🤝 Contributing to the Project

### Workflow

1. **Branch** from `main`: `git checkout -b feat/short-description`
2. **Implement** following existing patterns:
   - New feature → new folder under `src/features/`
   - Reusable piece → `src/components/` or `src/shared/`
3. **Add/update tests** alongside the code (`*.test.tsx`)
4. **Run local checks**: lint, types, tests, build
5. **Commit** (atomic, descriptive). Husky will block on errors
6. **Push & PR**. GitHub Actions runs CI; Netlify posts preview URL

### Review Checklist

- [ ] Tests pass (`pnpm test`)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (`pnpm check-types`)
- [ ] No linting errors (`pnpm lint`)
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns
- [ ] Documentation updated if behavior changed

## 🛠️ Practical Examples

### Adding a New Feature (Todo List)

Here's how to implement a complete feature from database to UI:

**Step 1: Database Schema**

```typescript
// src/db/schema/todos.ts
import { pgTable, text, boolean, timestamp } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";
import { createInsertSchema, createSelectSchema } from "drizzle-zod";

export const todos = pgTable("todos", {
  id: text("id")
    .primaryKey()
    .$defaultFn(() => crypto.randomUUID()),
  userId: text("user_id").notNull(),
  title: text("title").notNull(),
  completed: boolean("completed").default(false),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow(),
});

// Auto-generate Zod schemas for validation
export const insertTodoSchema = createInsertSchema(todos);
export const selectTodoSchema = createSelectSchema(todos);
export type Todo = typeof todos.$inferSelect;
export type NewTodo = typeof todos.$inferInsert;
```

**Step 2: Push Schema to Database**

```bash
pnpm db:push  # Creates the table in your database
```

**Step 3: API Route**

```typescript
// src/routes/api/todos/$.ts
import { createAPIFileRoute } from "@tanstack/start/api";
import { z } from "zod";
import { getDb } from "@/db/connections";
import { todos, insertTodoSchema } from "@/db/schema/todos";
import { requireAuth } from "@/lib/auth/middleware/auth-guard";
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";

export const APIRoute = createAPIFileRoute("/api/todos")({
  GET: async ({ request }) => {
    const user = await requireAuth(request);
    const db = getDb();
    const userTodos = await db.select().from(todos).where(eq(todos.userId, user.id));
    return Response.json(userTodos);
  },

  POST: async ({ request }) => {
    const user = await requireAuth(request);
    const body = await request.json();
    const validated = insertTodoSchema.parse({
      ...body,
      userId: user.id,
    });

    const db = getDb();
    const [newTodo] = await db.insert(todos).values(validated).returning();
    return Response.json(newTodo);
  },
});
```

**Step 4: Frontend Hook**

```typescript
// src/features/todos/hooks/useTodos.ts
import { useQuery, useMutation, useQueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import type { Todo, NewTodo } from "@/db/schema/todos";

export function useTodos() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();

  const todosQuery = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["todos"],
    queryFn: async () => {
      const res = await fetch("/api/todos");
      if (!res.ok) throw new Error("Failed to fetch todos");
      return res.json() as Promise<Todo[]>;
    },
  });

  const createTodo = useMutation({
    mutationFn: async (newTodo: Omit<NewTodo, "userId">) => {
      const res = await fetch("/api/todos", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify(newTodo),
      });
      if (!res.ok) throw new Error("Failed to create todo");
      return res.json();
    },
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["todos"] });
    },
  });

  return {
    todos: todosQuery.data ?? [],
    isLoading: todosQuery.isLoading,
    error: todosQuery.error,
    createTodo: createTodo.mutate,
  };
}
```

**Step 5: Page Component**

```typescript
// src/routes/todos/index.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { useTodos } from '@/features/todos/hooks/useTodos'
import { TodoList } from '@/features/todos/components/TodoList'
import { AddTodoForm } from '@/features/todos/components/AddTodoForm'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/todos')({
  component: TodosPage,
})

function TodosPage() {
  const { todos, isLoading, error, createTodo } = useTodos();

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto p-4">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">My Todos</h1>
      <AddTodoForm onSubmit={createTodo} />
      <TodoList todos={todos} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Notice how TypeScript types flow automatically from the database schema through the API to the frontend - no manual type definitions needed!

### Quick Answers

| Question                                    | Answer                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Where is the global React Query client?** | Created in `src/router.tsx`, injected via TanStack Router context                      |
| **Can I import server code on the client?** | No. Anything importing `env.server` or `serverOnly()` will fail. Keep boundaries clear |
| **How do I add a Netlify edge function?**   | Drop a `*.ts` file in `netlify/edge-functions/`, export `default` handler              |
| **Which test env is used?**                 | Vitest jsdom. Global stubs are set in `tests/setup.ts`                                 |
| **How do I debug failing tests?**           | Use `pnpm test:watch` and add `console.log` or `screen.debug()`                        |

### Security Best Practices

1. **Never Trust User Input**: Always validate with Zod
2. **Use Environment Variables**: Never hardcode secrets
3. **Implement Proper Authentication**: Use Better Auth's built-in features
4. **Database Security**: Drizzle handles parameterized queries automatically

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit secrets to the repository
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use least-privilege access for all tokens
- Review and audit secret usage periodically
- Remove unused secrets promptly

## Local Development

For local development, create a `.env` file in the project root with the same variables. The `.env` file is gitignored and should never be committed.

Example `.env` file:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/solstice_dev
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_dev_client_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_dev_client_secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_dev_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_dev_client_secret
```

# Design Document

## Overview

The user profile extension enhances the existing Better Auth user system by adding comprehensive profile fields required for membership management, team participation, and age verification. This design extends the current `user` table with additional columns while maintaining backward compatibility and following established patterns in the codebase.

The solution provides a foundation for profile completion validation, privacy settings management, and audit trail functionality that will support downstream features like membership purchases and team roster management.

## Architecture

### Database Layer Design

The design extends the existing `user` table in `src/db/schema/auth.schema.ts` rather than creating a separate profile table. This approach:

- Maintains referential integrity with existing Better Auth relationships
- Simplifies queries by avoiding joins for basic profile data
- Follows the established pattern of extending core entities
- Supports the existing authentication flow without breaking changes

### Schema Extension Strategy

```typescript
// Additional fields to be added to the existing user table
export const user = pgTable("user", {
  // ... existing fields (id, name, email, etc.)

  // Profile completion tracking
  profileComplete: boolean("profile_complete")
    .$defaultFn(() => false)
    .notNull(),

  // Required profile fields
  dateOfBirth: timestamp("date_of_birth"),
  emergencyContact: text("emergency_contact"), // JSON string

  // Optional profile fields
  gender: text("gender"),
  pronouns: text("pronouns"),
  phone: text("phone"),

  // Privacy and preferences
  privacySettings: text("privacy_settings"), // JSON string

  // Audit and versioning
  profileVersion: integer("profile_version")
    .$defaultFn(() => 1)
    .notNull(),
  profileUpdatedAt: timestamp("profile_updated_at").$defaultFn(() => new Date()),
});
```

### Data Validation Strategy

Profile data will be validated using Zod schemas that enforce:

- Date of birth format validation and reasonable age ranges
- Emergency contact structure (name, relationship, phone/email)
- Privacy settings structure validation
- Optional field constraints (pronouns, gender options)

## Components and Interfaces

### Server Functions Architecture

The design follows the established feature-based organization pattern:

```
src/features/profile/
├── profile.queries.ts     # Read operations
├── profile.mutations.ts   # Write operations
├── profile.types.ts       # TypeScript interfaces
├── profile.schemas.ts     # Zod validation schemas
└── __tests__/
    ├── profile.queries.test.ts
    └── profile.mutations.test.ts
```

### Core Server Functions

#### Query Functions

- `getUserProfile(userId: string)` - Retrieve complete user profile
- `getProfileCompletionStatus(userId: string)` - Check if profile is complete
- `validateProfileData(profileData: ProfileInput)` - Validate profile input

#### Mutation Functions

- `updateUserProfile(userId: string, profileData: ProfileInput)` - Update profile
- `completeUserProfile(userId: string, profileData: ProfileInput)` - Complete initial profile
- `updatePrivacySettings(userId: string, settings: PrivacySettings)` - Update privacy preferences

### Type System Design

```typescript
// Core profile interfaces
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  profileComplete: boolean;
  dateOfBirth?: Date;
  emergencyContact?: EmergencyContact;
  gender?: string;
  pronouns?: string;
  phone?: string;
  privacySettings?: PrivacySettings;
  profileVersion: number;
  profileUpdatedAt?: Date;
}

interface EmergencyContact {
  name: string;
  relationship: string;
  phone?: string;
  email?: string;
}

interface PrivacySettings {
  showEmail: boolean;
  showPhone: boolean;
  showBirthYear: boolean;
  allowTeamInvitations: boolean;
}

// Input types for mutations
interface ProfileInput {
  dateOfBirth: Date;
  emergencyContact: EmergencyContact;
  gender?: string;
  pronouns?: string;
  phone?: string;
  privacySettings?: PrivacySettings;
}
```

## Data Models

### Profile Completion Logic

The system determines profile completion based on required fields:

```typescript
function isProfileComplete(profile: UserProfile): boolean {
  return !!(
    profile.dateOfBirth &&
    profile.emergencyContact?.name &&
    profile.emergencyContact?.relationship &&
    (profile.emergencyContact?.phone || profile.emergencyContact?.email)
  );
}
```

### Privacy Settings Structure

Privacy settings use a structured approach with sensible defaults:

```typescript
const defaultPrivacySettings: PrivacySettings = {
  showEmail: false,
  showPhone: false,
  showBirthYear: true,
  allowTeamInvitations: true,
};
```

### Emergency Contact Validation

Emergency contact data is stored as JSON text and validated for completeness:

```typescript
const emergencyContactSchema = z
  .object({
    name: z.string().min(1, "Emergency contact name is required"),
    relationship: z.string().min(1, "Relationship is required"),
    phone: z.string().optional(),
    email: z.string().email().optional(),
  })
  .refine(
    (data) => data.phone || data.email,
    "Either phone or email is required for emergency contact",
  );
```

## Error Handling

### Validation Error Strategy

The design implements comprehensive error handling:

- **Field-level validation**: Individual field constraints and format validation
- **Cross-field validation**: Ensuring emergency contact has at least one contact method
- **Business rule validation**: Age verification, reasonable date ranges
- **Database constraint errors**: Handling unique constraints and foreign key violations

### Error Response Format

```typescript
interface ProfileError {
  field?: string;
  message: string;
  code:
    | "VALIDATION_ERROR"
    | "MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELD"
    | "INVALID_FORMAT"
    | "DATABASE_ERROR";
}

interface ProfileOperationResult {
  success: boolean;
  data?: UserProfile;
  errors?: ProfileError[];
}
```

### Graceful Degradation

The system handles partial profile data gracefully:

- Allows saving incomplete profiles with `profileComplete: false`
- Provides clear indication of missing required fields
- Supports incremental profile completion

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Approach

Each server function will have comprehensive unit tests covering:

#### Query Function Tests

- Valid user ID returns complete profile data
- Invalid user ID returns appropriate error
- Profile completion status calculation accuracy
- Privacy settings retrieval and defaults

#### Mutation Function Tests

- Valid profile data updates successfully
- Invalid data returns validation errors
- Profile completion status updates correctly
- Version tracking increments properly
- Audit trail timestamps update

#### Validation Tests

- Date of birth format and range validation
- Emergency contact completeness validation
- Privacy settings structure validation
- Cross-field validation rules

### Integration Testing

Database integration tests will verify:

- Schema migration applies correctly
- Indexes perform as expected
- Constraint violations handled properly
- Transaction rollback on errors

### Test Data Strategy

Test utilities will provide:

- Valid profile data fixtures
- Invalid data scenarios for error testing
- Partial profile data for completion testing
- Privacy settings variations

## Migration Strategy

### Database Migration Plan

The migration will be implemented as a single Drizzle migration file:

```sql
-- Add profile fields to existing user table
ALTER TABLE "user"
ADD COLUMN "profile_complete" boolean DEFAULT false NOT NULL,
ADD COLUMN "date_of_birth" timestamp,
ADD COLUMN "emergency_contact" text,
ADD COLUMN "gender" text,
ADD COLUMN "pronouns" text,
ADD COLUMN "phone" text,
ADD COLUMN "privacy_settings" text,
ADD COLUMN "profile_version" integer DEFAULT 1 NOT NULL,
ADD COLUMN "profile_updated_at" timestamp DEFAULT now();

-- Create indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX "user_profile_complete_idx" ON "user" ("profile_complete");
CREATE INDEX "user_date_of_birth_idx" ON "user" ("date_of_birth");
```

### Backward Compatibility

The migration maintains full backward compatibility:

- All new fields are nullable or have defaults
- Existing user records remain functional
- Authentication flows continue unchanged
- Profile completion defaults to `false` for existing users

### Data Integrity Measures

- Profile version tracking prevents concurrent update conflicts
- Timestamp tracking provides audit trail
- JSON validation ensures structured data storage
- Soft validation allows incremental profile building

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the current user authentication system to include comprehensive profile data required for membership management, team roster functionality, and age verification. Currently, the system only captures basic user information (name, email) during signup, but many downstream features require additional profile fields such as date of birth, emergency contact information, and privacy preferences.

The user profile extension will serve as the foundation for the member onboarding flow, membership purchase validation, and team management features that follow in the development roadmap.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to provide comprehensive profile information during registration, so that I can participate in memberships, teams, and events that require age verification and emergency contact details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes signup THEN the system SHALL capture additional profile fields including date of birth, gender, emergency contact, pronouns, and privacy settings
2. WHEN profile data is stored THEN the system SHALL validate date of birth format and ensure emergency contact information is complete
3. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL maintain an audit trail with timestamps and version tracking
4. IF a user provides privacy settings THEN the system SHALL store these preferences in a structured JSONB format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want profile data to be stored with proper data integrity and security measures, so that sensitive user information is protected and compliant with privacy regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN profile data is stored THEN the system SHALL use appropriate database constraints and indexes for performance
2. WHEN sensitive data is handled THEN the system SHALL implement soft-delete patterns to prevent data loss
3. WHEN profile updates occur THEN the system SHALL track modification timestamps and maintain data versioning
4. IF emergency contact data is stored THEN the system SHALL ensure it includes name, relationship, and contact information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want server functions for profile management, so that I can build user interfaces and integrate profile data with other system features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN profile server functions are implemented THEN the system SHALL provide query functions for retrieving user profiles
2. WHEN profile mutations are needed THEN the system SHALL provide server functions for creating and updating profile data
3. WHEN profile data is accessed THEN the system SHALL include proper TypeScript typing and Zod validation schemas
4. IF profile operations fail THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages and maintain data consistency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage for profile functionality, so that profile features work reliably and regressions are caught early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN profile server functions are implemented THEN the system SHALL include unit tests covering all query and mutation operations
2. WHEN profile validation is implemented THEN the system SHALL include tests for all validation scenarios including edge cases
3. WHEN database schema changes are made THEN the system SHALL include migration tests to ensure data integrity
4. IF profile operations involve error handling THEN the system SHALL include tests for error scenarios and recovery

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want my profile to indicate completion status, so that the system can guide me through required onboarding steps before accessing advanced features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's profile is evaluated THEN the system SHALL determine if required fields are complete
2. WHEN profile completion status changes THEN the system SHALL update the user record accordingly
3. WHEN downstream features check profile status THEN the system SHALL provide a reliable indicator of profile completeness
4. IF required profile fields are missing THEN the system SHALL identify which specific fields need completion

## Environment Variables

All environment variables are validated at startup using Zod schemas:

- **Server-side**: `src/lib/env.server.ts` (DATABASE_URL, BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, etc.)
- **Client-side**: `src/lib/env.client.ts` (VITE\_ prefixed variables only)
- **Required**: DATABASE_URL, VITE_BASE_URL, BETTER_AUTH_SECRET (production)

## Code Style Conventions

- **Imports**: Auto-organized with prettier-plugin-organize-imports
- **Quotes**: Double quotes, semicolons required
- **Line Length**: 90 characters
- **Trailing Commas**: Always
- **Path Aliases**: `~/` and `@/` for src directory
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, no `any` types, use type inference
- **Components**: Function components only, PascalCase naming
- **Files**: kebab-case for files, camelCase for functions/variables

## Form Development Guidelines

Follow the centralized form pattern using TanStack Form:

1. **Use `useAppForm` hook** from `src/lib/form.ts` (configured with `createFormHook`)
2. **Type safety via inference** - provide strongly-typed `defaultValues`, avoid explicit generics
3. **Reusable field components** - use `ValidatedInput`, `ValidatedSelect` etc. from form hook
4. **Zod validation** - pass Zod schemas to `validators` option for consistent validation
5. **Form construction** - use `form.AppField` with `name` prop and render prop pattern

## Database Connection Patterns

- **Use `db()` by default** - automatically selects pooled/unpooled based on environment
- **Use `pooledDb()` explicitly** - for API routes and serverless functions (< 30 seconds)
- **Use `unpooledDb()` explicitly** - for migrations and long-running operations (> 30 seconds)
- **Connection priority**: Custom overrides → Netlify auto-setup → fallback to DATABASE_URL

## Security Requirements

- **Rate limiting** on auth endpoints (5 requests/15min) and API routes (100 requests/15min)
- **Strong password validation** with strength meter (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- **Secure cookies** in production (HTTPS-only, HttpOnly, SameSite=lax)
- **CSP headers** with nonce-based script validation via Netlify Edge Functions
- **PIPEDA compliance** for Canadian privacy laws

## Documentation Automation

- **After significant `src/lib/` changes**: Run `pnpm docs:reference` to update API docs
- **After database schema updates**: Run `pnpm docs:erd` to regenerate ERD diagrams
- **Use `pnpm docs:all`** to update all automated documentation
- **Update project docs** in `docs/quadball-plan/` when implementing new features

title: Drizzle ORM Adapter
description: Integrate Better Auth with Drizzle ORM.
---

Drizzle ORM is a powerful and flexible ORM for Node.js and TypeScript. It provides a simple and intuitive API for working with databases, and supports a wide range of databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more.
Read more here: [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/).

## Example Usage

Make sure you have Drizzle installed and configured.
Then, you can use the Drizzle adapter to connect to your database.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { drizzleAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/drizzle";
import { db } from "./database.ts";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: drizzleAdapter(db, {
    // [!code highlight]
    provider: "sqlite", // or "pg" or "mysql" // [!code highlight]
  }), // [!code highlight]
  //... the rest of your config
});
```

## Schema generation & migration

The [Better Auth CLI](/docs/concepts/cli) allows you to generate or migrate
your database schema based on your Better Auth configuration and plugins.

To generate the schema required by Better Auth, run the following command:

```bash title="Schema Generation"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```

To generate and apply the migration, run the following commands:

```bash title="Schema Migration"
npx drizzle-kit generate # generate the migration file
npx drizzle-kit migrate # apply the migration
```

## Additional Information

The Drizzle adapter expects the schema you define to match the table names. For example, if your Drizzle schema maps the `user` table to `users`, you need to manually pass the schema and map it to the user table.

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { db } from "./drizzle";
import { drizzleAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/drizzle";
import { schema } from "./schema";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: drizzleAdapter(db, {
    provider: "sqlite", // or "pg" or "mysql"
    schema: {
      ...schema,
      user: schema.users,
    },
  }),
});
```

If all your tables are using plural form, you can just pass the `usePlural` option:
```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: drizzleAdapter(db, {
    ...
    usePlural: true,
  }),
});
```

<file path="docs/better-auth/authentication/apple.mdx">

title: Apple
description: Apple provider setup and usage.
---
<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Get your OAuth credentials
        To use Apple sign in, you need a client ID and client secret. You can get them from the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list).

        You will need an active **Apple Developer account** to access the developer portal and generate these credentials.

        Follow these steps to set up your App ID, Service ID, and generate the key needed for your client secret:

        1.  **Navigate to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles:**
            In the Apple Developer Portal, go to the "Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles" section.

        2.  **Create an App ID:**
            *   Go to the `Identifiers` tab.
            *   Click the `+` icon next to Identifiers.
            *   Select `App IDs`, then click `Continue`.
            *   Select `App` as the type, then click `Continue`.
            *   **Description:** Enter a name for your app (e.g., "My Awesome App"). This name may be displayed to users when they sign in.
            *   **Bundle ID:** Set a bundle ID. The recommended format is a reverse domain name (e.g., `com.yourcompany.yourapp`). Using a suffix like `.ai` (for app identifier) can help with organization but is not required (e.g., `com.yourcompany.yourapp.ai`).
            *   Scroll down to **Capabilities**. Select the checkbox for `Sign In with Apple`.
            *   Click `Continue`, then `Register`.

        3.  **Create a Service ID:**
            *   Go back to the `Identifiers` tab.
            *   Click the `+` icon.
            *   Select `Service IDs`, then click `Continue`.
            *   **Description:** Enter a description for this service (e.g., your app name again).
            *   **Identifier:** Set a unique identifier for the service. Use a reverse domain format, distinct from your App ID (e.g., `com.yourcompany.yourapp.si`, where `.si` indicates service identifier - this is for your organization and not required). **This Service ID will be your `clientId`.**
            *   Click `Continue`, then `Register`.

        4.  **Configure the Service ID:**
            *   Find the Service ID you just created in the `Identifiers` list and click on it.
            *   Check the `Sign In with Apple` capability, then click `Configure`.
            *   Under **Primary App ID**, select the App ID you created earlier (e.g., `com.yourcompany.yourapp.ai`).
            *   Under **Domains and Subdomains**, list all the root domains you will use for Sign In with Apple (e.g., `example.com`, `anotherdomain.com`).
            *   Under **Return URLs**, enter the callback URL. `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/apple`. Add all necessary return URLs.
            *   Click `Next`, then `Done`.
            *   Click `Continue`, then `Save`.

        5.  **Create a Client Secret Key:**
            *   Go to the `Keys` tab.
            *   Click the `+` icon to create a new key.
            *   **Key Name:** Enter a name for the key (e.g., "Sign In with Apple Key").
            *   Scroll down and select the checkbox for `Sign In with Apple`.
            *   Click the `Configure` button next to `Sign In with Apple`.
            *   Select the **Primary App ID** you created earlier.
            *   Click `Save`, then `Continue`, then `Register`.
            *   **Download the Key:** Immediately download the `.p8` key file. **This file is only available for download once.** Note the Key ID (available on the Keys page after creation) and your Team ID (available in your Apple Developer Account settings).

        6.  **Generate the Client Secret (JWT):**
            Apple requires a JSON Web Token (JWT) to be generated dynamically using the downloaded `.p8` key, the Key ID, and your Team ID. This JWT serves as your `clientSecret`.

            You can use the guide below from [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accountorganizationaldatasharing/creating-a-client-secret) to understand how to generate this client secret. You can also use our built in generator [below](#generate-apple-client-secret-jwt) to generate the client secret JWT required for 'Sign in with Apple'.


    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to add it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

        You also need to add `https://appleid.apple.com` to the `trustedOrigins` array in your auth instance configuration to allow communication with Apple's authentication servers.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            socialProviders: {
                apple: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.APPLE_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.APPLE_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                    // Optional
                    appBundleIdentifier: process.env.APPLE_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER as string, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            },
            // Add appleid.apple.com to trustedOrigins for Sign In with Apple flows
            trustedOrigins: ["https://appleid.apple.com"], // [!code highlight]
        })
        ```

        On native iOS, it doesn't use the service ID but the app ID (bundle ID) as client ID, so if using the service ID as `clientId` in `signIn.social` with `idToken`, it throws an error: `JWTClaimValidationFailed: unexpected "aud" claim value`. So you need to provide the `appBundleIdentifier` when you want to sign in with Apple using the ID Token.
    </Step>
</Steps>


## Usage

### Sign In with Apple

To sign in with Apple, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
- `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `apple`.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"  /
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
const authClient =  createAuthClient()

const signIn = async () => {
    const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
        provider: "apple"
    })
}
```


### Sign In with Apple With ID Token

To sign in with Apple using the ID Token, you can use the `signIn.social` function to pass the ID Token. 

This is useful when you have the ID Token from Apple on the client-side and want to use it to sign in on the server.

<Callout>
 If ID token is provided no redirection will happen, and the user will be signed in directly.
</Callout>

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
await authClient.signIn.social({
    provider: "apple",
    idToken: {
        token: // Apple ID Token,
        nonce: // Nonce (optional)
        accessToken: // Access Token (optional)
    }
})
```

<Steps>
    <Step> 
        ### Get your Discord credentials
        To use Discord sign in, you need a client ID and client secret. You can get them from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

        Make sure to set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/discord` for local development. For production, you should set it to the URL of your application. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.
    </Step>

  <Step>
        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

        ```ts title="auth.ts" 
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        
        export const auth = betterAuth({ 
            socialProviders: {
                discord: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            },
        })
        ```
    </Step>
       <Step>
        ### Sign In with Discord 
        To sign in with Discord, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
        - `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `discord`.

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        const authClient =  createAuthClient()
        
        const signIn = async () => {
            const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
                provider: "discord"
            })
        }

title: Email & Password
description: Implementing email and password authentication with Better Auth.
---

Email and password authentication is a common method used by many applications. Better Auth provides a built-in email and password authenticator that you can easily integrate into your project.

<Callout type="info">
  If you prefer username-based authentication, check out the{" "}
  <Link href="/docs/plugins/username">username plugin</Link>. It extends the
  email and password authenticator with username support.
</Callout>

## Enable Email and Password

To enable email and password authentication, you need to set the `emailAndPassword.enabled` option to `true` in the `auth` configuration.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  emailAndPassword: { // [!code highlight]
    enabled: true, // [!code highlight]
  }, // [!code highlight]
});
```

<Callout type="info">
  If it's not enabled, it'll not allow you to sign in or sign up with email and
  password.
</Callout>

## Usage

### Sign Up

To sign a user up, you can use the `signUp.email` function provided by the client.

<APIMethod path="/sign-up/email" method="POST">
```ts
type signUpEmail = {
    /**
     * The name of the user.
     */
    name: string = "John Doe"
    /**
     * The email address of the user.
     */
    email: string = "john.doe@example.com"
    /**
     * The password of the user. It should be at least 8 characters long and max 128 by default.
     */
    password: string = "password1234"
    /**
     * An optional profile image of the user.
     */
    image?: string = "https://example.com/image.png"
    /**
     * An optional URL to redirect to after the user signs up.
     */
    callbackURL?: string = "https://example.com/callback"
}
```
</APIMethod>

<Callout>
  These are the default properties for the sign up email endpoint, however it's possible that with [additional fields](/docs/concepts/typescript#additional-fields) or special plugins you can pass more properties to the endpoint.
</Callout>


### Sign In

To sign a user in, you can use the `signIn.email` function provided by the client.  

<APIMethod path="/sign-in/email" method="POST" requireSession>
```ts
type signInEmail = {
    /**
     * The email address of the user.
     */
    email: string = "john.doe@example.com"
    /**
     * The password of the user. It should be at least 8 characters long and max 128 by default.
     */
    password: string = "password1234"
    /**
     * If false, the user will be signed out when the browser is closed. (optional) (default: true)
     */
    rememberMe?: boolean = true
    /**
     * An optional URL to redirect to after the user signs in. (optional)
     */
    callbackURL?: string = "https://example.com/callback"
}
```
</APIMethod>

<Callout>
  These are the default properties for the sign in email endpoint, however it's possible that with [additional fields](/docs/concepts/typescript#additional-fields) or special plugins you can pass different properties to the endpoint.
</Callout>


### Sign Out

To sign a user out, you can use the `signOut` function provided by the client.

<APIMethod path="/sign-out" method="POST" requireSession noResult>
```ts
type signOut = {
}
```
</APIMethod>

you can pass `fetchOptions` to redirect onSuccess
  
```ts title="auth-client.ts" 
await authClient.signOut({
  fetchOptions: {
    onSuccess: () => {
      router.push("/login"); // redirect to login page
    },
  },
});
```

### Email Verification

To enable email verification, you need to pass a function that sends a verification email with a link. The `sendVerificationEmail` function takes a data object with the following properties:

- `user`: The user object.
- `url`: The URL to send to the user which contains the token.
- `token`: A verification token used to complete the email verification.

and a `request` object as the second parameter.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { sendEmail } from "./email"; // your email sending function

export const auth = betterAuth({
  emailVerification: {
    sendVerificationEmail: async ( { user, url, token }, request) => {
      await sendEmail({
        to: user.email,
        subject: "Verify your email address",
        text: `Click the link to verify your email: ${url}`,
      });
    },
  },
});
```

On the client side you can use `sendVerificationEmail` function to send verification link to user. This will trigger the `sendVerificationEmail` function you provided in the `auth` configuration.

Once the user clicks on the link in the email, if the token is valid, the user will be redirected to the URL provided in the `callbackURL` parameter. If the token is invalid, the user will be redirected to the URL provided in the `callbackURL` parameter with an error message in the query string `?error=invalid_token`.

#### Require Email Verification

If you enable require email verification, users must verify their email before they can log in. And every time a user tries to sign in, sendVerificationEmail is called.

<Callout>
  This only works if you have sendVerificationEmail implemented and if the user
  is trying to sign in with email and password.
</Callout>

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
  emailAndPassword: {
    requireEmailVerification: true,
  },
});
```

If a user tries to sign in without verifying their email, you can handle the error and show a message to the user.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
await authClient.signIn.email(
  {
    email: "email@example.com",
    password: "password",
  },
  {
    onError: (ctx) => {
      // Handle the error
      if (ctx.error.status === 403) {
        alert("Please verify your email address");
      }
      //you can also show the original error message
      alert(ctx.error.message);
    },
  }
);
```

#### Triggering manually Email Verification

You can trigger the email verification manually by calling the `sendVerificationEmail` function.

```ts
await authClient.sendVerificationEmail({
  email: "user@email.com",
  callbackURL: "/", // The redirect URL after verification
});
```

### Request Password Reset

To allow users to reset a password first you need to provide `sendResetPassword` function to the email and password authenticator. The `sendResetPassword` function takes a data object with the following properties:

- `user`: The user object.
- `url`: The URL to send to the user which contains the token.
- `token`: A verification token used to complete the password reset.

and a `request` object as the second parameter.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { sendEmail } from "./email"; // your email sending function

export const auth = betterAuth({
  emailAndPassword: {
    enabled: true,
    sendResetPassword: async ({user, url, token}, request) => {
      await sendEmail({
        to: user.email,
        subject: "Reset your password",
        text: `Click the link to reset your password: ${url}`,
      });
    },
    onPasswordReset: async ({ user }, request) => {
      // your logic here
      console.log(`Password for user ${user.email} has been reset.`);
    },
  },
});
```

Additionally, you can provide an `onPasswordReset` callback to execute logic after a password has been successfully reset.

Once you configured your server you can call `requestPasswordReset` function to send reset password link to user. If the user exists, it will trigger the `sendResetPassword` function you provided in the auth config.

<APIMethod path="/request-password-reset" method="POST">
```ts
type requestPasswordReset = {
    /**
     * The email address of the user to send a password reset email to 
     */
    email: string = "john.doe@example.com"
    /**
     * The URL to redirect the user to reset their password. If the token isn't valid or expired, it'll be redirected with a query parameter `?error=INVALID_TOKEN`. If the token is valid, it'll be redirected with a query parameter `?token=VALID_TOKEN 
     */
    redirectTo?: string = "https://example.com/reset-password"
}
```
</APIMethod>

When a user clicks on the link in the email, they will be redirected to the reset password page. You can add the reset password page to your app. Then you can use `resetPassword` function to reset the password. It takes an object with the following properties:

- `newPassword`: The new password of the user.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const { data, error } = await authClient.resetPassword({
  newPassword: "password1234",
  token,
});
```

<APIMethod path="/reset-password" method="POST">
```ts
const token = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get("token");

if (!token) {
  // Handle the error
}

type resetPassword = {
    /**
     * The new password to set 
     */
    newPassword: string = "password1234"
    /**
     * The token to reset the password 
     */
    token: string
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Update password
A user's password isn't stored in the user table. Instead, it's stored in the account table. To change the password of a user, you can use one of the following approaches:


<APIMethod path="/change-password" method="POST" requireSession>
```ts
type changePassword = {
    /**
     * The new password to set 
     */
    newPassword: string = "newpassword1234"
    /**
     * The current user password 
     */
    currentPassword: string = "oldpassword1234"
    /**
     * When set to true, all other active sessions for this user will be invalidated
     */
    revokeOtherSessions?: boolean = true
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Configuration

**Password**

Better Auth stores passwords inside the `account` table with `providerId` set to `credential`.

**Password Hashing**: Better Auth uses `scrypt` to hash passwords. The `scrypt` algorithm is designed to be slow and memory-intensive to make it difficult for attackers to brute force passwords. OWASP recommends using `scrypt` if `argon2id` is not available. We decided to use `scrypt` because it's natively supported by Node.js.

You can pass custom password hashing algorithm by setting `passwordHasher` option in the `auth` configuration.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { scrypt } from "scrypt"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    //...rest of the options
    emailAndPassword: {
        password: {
            hash: // your custom password hashing function
            verify: // your custom password verification function
        }
    }
})
```

title: Facebook
description: Facebook provider setup and usage.
---

<Steps>
    <Step> 
        ### Get your Facebook credentials
        To use Facebook sign in, you need a client ID and client Secret. You can get them from the [Facebook Developer Portal](https://developers.facebook.com/).
        Select your app, navigate to **App Settings > Basic**, locate the following:  
        - **App ID**: This is your `clientId`
        - **App Secret**: This is your `clientSecret`.

        <Callout type="warn">
        Avoid exposing the `clientSecret` in client-side code (e.g., frontend apps) because it’s sensitive information.
        </Callout>

        Make sure to set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/facebook` for local development. For production, you should set it to the URL of your application. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.
    </Step>

  <Step>
        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"  
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        
        export const auth = betterAuth({
            socialProviders: {
                facebook: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            },
        })
        ```

        <Callout>
        BetterAuth also supports Facebook Login for Business, all you need
        to do is provide the `configId` as listed in **Facebook Login For Business > Configurations** alongside your `clientId` and `clientSecret`. Note that the app must be a Business app and, since BetterAuth expects to have an email address and account id, the configuration must be of the "User access token" type. "System-user access token" is not supported.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
       <Step>
        ### Sign In with Facebook
        To sign in with Facebook, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
        - `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `facebook`.

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/auth-client"
        const authClient = createAuthClient()

        const signIn = async () => {
            const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
                provider: "facebook"
            })
        }
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Additional Configuration

### Scopes
By default, Facebook provides basic user information. If you need additional permissions, you can specify scopes in your auth configuration:

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    socialProviders: {
        facebook: {
            clientId: process.env.FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID as string,
            clientSecret: process.env.FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
            scopes: ["email", "public_profile", "user_friends"], // Overwrites permissions
            fields: ["user_friends"], // Extending list of fields
        },
    },
})
```

Additional options:
- `scopes`: Access basic account information (overwrites).
    - Default: `"email", "public_profile"`
- `fields`: Extend list of fields to retrieve from the Facebook user profile (assignment).
    - Default: `"id", "name", "email", "picture"`

### Sign In with Facebook With ID or Access Token

To sign in with Facebook using the ID Token, you can use the `signIn.social` function to pass the ID Token.

This is useful when you have the ID Token from Facebook on the client-side and want to use it to sign in on the server.

<Callout>
 If ID token is provided no redirection will happen, and the user will be signed in directly.
</Callout>

For limited login, you need to pass `idToken.token`, for only `accessToken` you need to pass `idToken.accessToken` and `idToken.token` together because of (#1183)[https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/issues/1183].


```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
    provider: "facebook",
    idToken: {  // [!code highlight]
        ...(platform === 'ios' ?  // [!code highlight]
            { token: idToken }  // [!code highlight]
            : { token: accessToken, accessToken: accessToken }), // [!code highlight]
    },
})
```

For a complete list of available permissions, refer to the [Permissions Reference](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions).

<Steps>
    <Step> 
        ### Get your GitHub credentials
        To use GitHub sign in, you need a client ID and client secret. You can get them from the [GitHub Developer Portal](https://github.com/settings/developers).

        Make sure to set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github` for local development. For production, you should set it to the URL of your application. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.

        Important: You MUST include the user:email scope in your GitHub app. See details below.
    </Step>

  <Step>
        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

                    clientId: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            },
        })
        ```
    </Step>
       <Step>
        ### Sign In with GitHub
        To sign in with GitHub, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
        - `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `github`.

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"  
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        const authClient =  createAuthClient()
        
        const signIn = async () => {
            const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
                provider: "github"
            })
        }
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

### Setting up your Github app

Github has two types of apps: Github apps and OAuth apps.

For OAuth apps, you don't have to do anything special (just follow the steps above). For Github apps, you DO have to add one more thing, which is enable it to read the user's email:

1. After creating your app, go to *Permissions and Events* > *Account Permissions* > *Email Addresses* and select "Read-Only"

2. Save changes. 

That's all! Now you can copy the Client ID and Client Secret of your app!

If you get "email_not_found" error, it's because you selected a Github app & did not configure this part!
</Callout>

### Why don't I have a refresh token?

Github doesn't issue refresh tokens for OAuth apps. For regular OAuth apps,
GitHub issues access tokens that remain valid indefinitely unless the user revokes them,
the app revokes them, or they go unused for a year.
There's no need for a refresh token because the access token doesn't expire on a short interval like Google or Discord.

<Steps>
    <Step> 
        ### Get your GitLab credentials
        To use GitLab sign in, you need a client ID and client secret. [GitLab OAuth documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/oauth2.html).

        Make sure to set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/gitlab` for local development. For production, you should set it to the URL of your application. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.
    </Step>

  <Step>
        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        
        export const auth = betterAuth({
            socialProviders: {
                gitlab: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.GITLAB_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                    issuer: process.env.GITLAB_ISSUER as string, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            },
        })
        ```
    </Step>
       <Step>
        ### Sign In with GitLab
        To sign in with GitLab, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
        - `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `gitlab`.

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"  
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        const authClient =  createAuthClient()
        
        const signIn = async () => {
            const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
                provider: "gitlab"

<Steps>
    <Step> 
        ### Get your Google credentials
        To use Google as a social provider, you need to get your Google credentials. You can get them by creating a new project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).

        In the Google Cloud Console > Credentials > Authorized redirect URIs, make sure to set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` for local development. For production, make sure to set the redirect URL as your application domain, e.g. `https://example.com/api/auth/callback/google`. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.
    </Step>

  <Step>
        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to pass the `clientId` and `clientSecret` to `socialProviders.google` in your auth configuration.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"   
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        
        export const auth = betterAuth({
            socialProviders: {
                google: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            },
        })
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

### Sign In with Google

To sign in with Google, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
- `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `google`.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"  /
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
const authClient =  createAuthClient()

const signIn = async () => {
    const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
        provider: "google"
    })
}
```

### Sign In with Google With ID Token

To sign in with Google using the ID Token, you can use the `signIn.social` function to pass the ID Token.

This is useful when you have the ID Token from Google on the client-side and want to use it to sign in on the server.

<Callout>
 If ID token is provided no redirection will happen, and the user will be signed in directly.
</Callout>

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
    provider: "google",
    idToken: {
        token: // Google ID Token,
        accessToken: // Google Access Token
    }
})
```

<Callout>
    If you want to use google one tap, you can use the [One Tap Plugin](/docs/plugins/one-tap) guide.
</Callout>

### Always ask to select an account

If you want to always ask the user to select an account, you pass the `prompt` parameter to the provider, setting it to `select_account`.  

```ts
socialProviders: {
    google: {
        prompt: "select_account", // [!code highlight]
        clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID as string,
        clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
    },
}
```

### Requesting Additional Google Scopes

If your application needs additional Google scopes after the user has already signed up (e.g., for Google Drive, Gmail, or other Google services), you can request them using the `linkSocial` method with the same Google provider.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const requestGoogleDriveAccess = async () => {
    await authClient.linkSocial({
        provider: "google",
        scopes: ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file"],
    });
};

// Example usage in a React component
return <button onClick={requestGoogleDriveAccess}>Add Google Drive Permissions</button>;
```

This will trigger a new OAuth flow that requests the additional scopes. After completion, your account will have the new scope in the database, and the access token will give you access to the requested Google APIs.

<Callout>
Ensure you're using Better Auth version 1.2.7 or later to avoid "Social account already linked" errors when requesting additional scopes from the same provider.
</Callout>


### Always get refresh token

Google only issues a refresh token the first time a user consents to your app.
If the user has already authorized your app, subsequent OAuth flows will only return an access token, not a refresh token.

To always get a refresh token, you can set the `accessType` to `offline`, and `prompt` to `select_account+consent` in the provider options.

```ts
socialProviders: {
    google: {
        clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID as string,
        clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
        accessType: "offline", // [!code highlight]
        prompt: "select_account+consent", // [!code highlight]
    },
}
```

<Callout>
    **Revoking Access:** If you want to get a new refresh token for a user who has already authorized your app,
    you must have them revoke your app's access in their Google account settings, then re-authorize.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Usage

### Sign In with Notion

To sign in with Notion, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
- `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `notion`.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"  
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
const authClient =  createAuthClient()

const signIn = async () => {
    const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
        provider: "notion"
    })
}
```

### Notion Integration Types

Notion supports different integration types. When creating your integration, you can choose between:

- **Public integrations**: Can be installed by any Notion workspace
- **Internal integrations**: Limited to your own workspace

For most authentication use cases, you'll want to create a public integration to allow users from different workspaces to sign in.

### Requesting Additional Notion Scopes

If your application needs additional Notion capabilities after the user has already signed up, you can request them using the `linkSocial` method with the same Notion provider and additional scopes.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"

Better Auth providers out of the box support for the [Generic Oauth Plugin](/docs/plugins/generic-oauth) which allows you to use any social provider that implements the OAuth2 protocol or OpenID Connect (OIDC) flows.

To use a provider that is not supported out of the box, you can use the [Generic Oauth Plugin](/docs/plugins/generic-oauth).

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Add the plugin to your auth config

    To use the Generic OAuth plugin, add it to your auth config.

    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
    import { genericOAuth } from "better-auth/plugins" // [!code highlight]

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        // ... other config options
        plugins: [
            genericOAuth({ // [!code highlight]
                config: [ // [!code highlight]
                    { // [!code highlight]
                        providerId: "provider-id", // [!code highlight]
                        clientId: "test-client-id", // [!code highlight]
                        clientSecret: "test-client-secret", // [!code highlight]
                        discoveryUrl: "https://auth.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration", // [!code highlight]
                        // ... other config options // [!code highlight]
                    }, // [!code highlight]
                    // Add more providers as needed // [!code highlight]
                ] // [!code highlight]
            }) // [!code highlight]
        ]
    })
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add the client plugin

    Include the Generic OAuth client plugin in your authentication client instance.

    ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
    import { genericOAuthClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

    const authClient = createAuthClient({
        plugins: [
            genericOAuthClient()
        ]
    })
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

title: Reddit
description: Reddit provider setup and usage.
---

<Steps>
    <Step> 
        ### Get your Reddit Credentials
        To use Reddit sign in, you need a client ID and client secret. You can get them from the [Reddit Developer Portal](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps).

        1. Click "Create App" or "Create Another App"
        2. Select "web app" as the application type
        3. Set the redirect URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/reddit` for local development
        4. For production, set it to your application's domain (e.g. `https://example.com/api/auth/callback/reddit`)
        5. After creating the app, you'll get the client ID (under the app name) and client secret

        If you change the base path of the auth routes, make sure to update the redirect URL accordingly.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        
        export const auth = betterAuth({
            socialProviders: {
                reddit: {
                    clientId: process.env.REDDIT_CLIENT_ID as string,
                    clientSecret: process.env.REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
                },
            },
        })
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Sign In with Reddit
        To sign in with Reddit, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
        - `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `reddit`.

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        const authClient = createAuthClient()
        
        const signIn = async () => {
            const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
                provider: "reddit"
            })
        }
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Additional Configuration

### Scopes
By default, Reddit provides basic user information. If you need additional permissions, you can specify scopes in your auth configuration:

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    socialProviders: {
        reddit: {
            clientId: process.env.REDDIT_CLIENT_ID as string,
            clientSecret: process.env.REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
            duration: "permanent",
            scope: ["read", "submit"] // Add required scopes
        },
    },
})
```

Common Reddit scopes include:
- `identity`: Access basic account information
- `read`: Access posts and comments
- `submit`: Submit posts and comments
- `subscribe`: Manage subreddit subscriptions
- `history`: Access voting history

For a complete list of available scopes, refer to the [Reddit OAuth2 documentation](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/oauth).

<Steps>
    <Step> 
        ### Get your Slack credentials
        To use Slack as a social provider, you need to create a Slack app and get your credentials.

        1. Go to [Your Apps on Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click "Create New App"
        2. Choose "From scratch" and give your app a name and select a development workspace
        3. In your app settings, navigate to "OAuth & Permissions"
        4. Under "Redirect URLs", add your redirect URL:
           - For local development: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/slack`
           - For production: `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/slack`
        5. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret from the "Basic Information" page

        <Callout>
            Slack requires HTTPS for redirect URLs in production. For local development, you can use tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a secure tunnel.
        </Callout>
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to pass the `clientId` and `clientSecret` to `socialProviders.slack` in your auth configuration.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            socialProviders: {
                slack: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.SLACK_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            },
        })
        ```
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Usage

### Sign In with Slack

To sign in with Slack, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:

- `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `slack`.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
const authClient = createAuthClient();

const signIn = async () => {
  const data = await authClient.signIn.social({ provider: "slack" });
};
```

### Requesting Additional Scopes

By default, Slack uses OpenID Connect scopes: `openid`, `profile`, and `email`. You can request additional Slack scopes during sign-in:

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const signInWithSlack = async () => {
  await authClient.signIn.social({
    provider: "slack",
    scopes: ["channels:read", "chat:write"], // Additional Slack API scopes
  });
};
```

### Workspace-Specific Sign In

If you want to restrict sign-in to a specific Slack workspace, you can pass the `team` parameter:

```ts title="auth.ts"
socialProviders: {
    slack: {
        clientId: process.env.SLACK_CLIENT_ID as string,
        clientSecret: process.env.SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET as string,
        team: "T1234567890", // Your Slack workspace ID
    },
}
```

### Using Slack API After Sign In

After successful authentication, you can access the user's Slack information through the session. The access token can be used to make requests to the Slack API:

```ts
const session = await authClient.getSession();
if (session?.user) {
  // Access Slack-specific data
  const slackUserId = session.user.id; // This is the Slack user ID
  // The access token is stored securely on the server
}
```

<Callout>
  The Slack provider uses OpenID Connect by default, which provides basic user
  information. If you need to access other Slack APIs, make sure to request the
  appropriate scopes during sign-in.

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Get your TikTok Credentials
        To integrate with TikTok, you need to obtain API credentials by creating an application in the [TikTok Developer Portal](https://developers.tiktok.com/apps).

        Follow these steps:
        1. Create an account on the TikTok Developer Portal
        2. Create a new application
        3. Set up a sandbox environment for testing
        4. Configure your redirect URL (must be HTTPS)
        5. Note your Client ID, Client Secret and Client Key

        <Callout type="info">
            - The TikTok API does not work with localhost. You need to use a public domain for the redirect URL and HTTPS for local testing. You can use [NGROK](https://ngrok.com/) or another similar tool for this.
            - For testing, you will need to use the [Sandbox mode](https://developers.tiktok.com/blog/introducing-sandbox), which you can enable in the TikTok Developer Portal.
            - The default scope is `user.info.profile`. For additional scopes, refer to the [Available Scopes](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/tiktok-api-scopes/) documentation.
        </Callout>

        Make sure to set the redirect URL to a valid HTTPS domain for local development. For production, you should set it to the URL of your application. If you change the base path of the auth routes, you should update the redirect URL accordingly.

        <Callout type="info">
            - The TikTok API does not provide email addresses. As a workaround, this implementation uses the user's `username` value for the `email` field, which is why it requires the `user.info.profile` scope instead of just `user.info.basic`.
            - For production use, you will need to request approval from TikTok for the scopes you intend to use.
        </Callout>
    </Step>

  <Step>
        ### Configure the provider
        To configure the provider, you need to import the provider and pass it to the `socialProviders` option of the auth instance.

        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth" 
        
        export const auth = betterAuth({
            socialProviders: {
                twitter: { // [!code highlight]
                    clientId: process.env.TWITTER_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
                    clientSecret: process.env.TWITTER_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
                }, // [!code highlight]
            },
        })
        ```
    </Step>
       <Step>
        ### Sign In with Twitter 
        To sign in with Twitter, you can use the `signIn.social` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:
        - `provider`: The provider to use. It should be set to `twitter`.

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"  
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        const authClient =  createAuthClient()
        
        const signIn = async () => {
            const data = await authClient.signIn.social({
                provider: "twitter"
            })
        }
        ```

<file path="docs/better-auth/concepts/api.mdx">
---
title: API
description: Better Auth API.
---

When you create a new Better Auth instance, it provides you with an `api` object. This object exposes every endpoint that exist in your Better Auth instance. And you can use this to interact with Better Auth server side.

Any endpoint added to Better Auth, whether from plugins or the core, will be accessible through the `api` object.

## Calling API Endpoints on the Server

To call an API endpoint on the server, import your `auth` instance and call the endpoint using the `api` object.

```ts title="server.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { headers } from "next/headers";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    //...
})

// calling get session on the server
await auth.api.getSession({
    headers: await headers() // some endpoint might require headers
})
```

### Body, Headers, Query

Unlike the client, the server needs the values to be passed as an object with the key `body` for the body, `headers` for the headers, and `query` for query parameters.

```ts title="server.ts"
await auth.api.getSession({
    headers: await headers()
})

await auth.api.signInEmail({
    body: {
        email: "john@doe.com",
        password: "password"
    },
    headers: await headers() // optional but would be useful to get the user IP, user agent, etc.
})

await auth.api.verifyEmail({
    query: {
        token: "my_token"
    }
})
```

<Callout>
Better auth API endpoints are built on top of [better-call](https://github.com/bekacru/better-call), a tiny web framework that lets you call REST API endpoints as if they were regular functions and allows us to easily infer client types from the server.
</Callout>

### Getting `headers` and `Response` Object

When you invoke an API endpoint on the server, it will return a standard JavaScript object or array directly as it's just a regular function call.

But there are times where you might want to get the `headers` or the `Response` object instead. For example, if you need to get the cookies or the headers.

#### Getting `headers`

To get the `headers`, you can pass the `returnHeaders` option to the endpoint.

```ts
const { headers, response } = await auth.api.signUpEmail({
	returnHeaders: true,
	body: {
		email: "john@doe.com",
		password: "password",
		name: "John Doe",
	},
});
```

The `headers` will be a `Headers` object. Which you can use to get the cookies or the headers.

```ts
const cookies = headers.get("set-cookie");
const headers = headers.get("x-custom-header");
```

#### Getting `Response` Object

To get the `Response` object, you can pass the `asResponse` option to the endpoint.

```ts title="server.ts"
const response = await auth.api.signInEmail({
    body: {
        email: "",
        password: ""
    },
    asResponse: true
})
```

### Error Handling

When you call an API endpoint in the server, it will throw an error if the request fails. You can catch the error and handle it as you see fit. The error instance is an instance of `APIError`.

```ts title="server.ts"
import { APIError } from "better-auth/api";

try {
    await auth.api.signInEmail({
        body: {
            email: "",
            password: ""
        }
    })
} catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof APIError) {
        console.log(error.message, error.status)
    }
}
```

title: CLI
description: Built-in CLI for managing your project.
---

Better Auth comes with a built-in CLI to help you manage the database schemas, initialize your project, and generate a secret key for your application.

## Generate

The `generate` command creates the schema required by Better Auth. If you're using a database adapter like Prisma or Drizzle, this command will generate the right schema for your ORM. If you're using the built-in Kysely adapter, it will generate an SQL file you can run directly on your database.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```

### Options

- `--output` - Where to save the generated schema. For Prisma, it will be saved in prisma/schema.prisma. For Drizzle, it goes to schema.ts in your project root. For Kysely, it’s an SQL file saved as schema.sql in your project root.
- `--config` - The path to your Better Auth config file. By default, the CLI will search for a auth.ts file in **./**, **./utils**, **./lib**, or any of these directories under `src` directory.
- `--yes` - Skip the confirmation prompt and generate the schema directly.


## Migrate

The migrate command applies the Better Auth schema directly to your database. This is available if you’re using the built-in Kysely adapter. For other adapters, you'll need to apply the schema using your ORM's migration tool.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest migrate
```

### Options

- `--config` - The path to your Better Auth config file. By default, the CLI will search for a auth.ts file in **./**, **./utils**, **./lib**, or any of these directories under `src` directory.
- `--yes` - Skip the confirmation prompt and apply the schema directly.

## Init

The `init` command allows you to initialize Better Auth in your project.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest init
```

### Options

- `--name` - The name of your application. (Defaults to your `package.json`'s `name` property.)
- `--framework` - The framework your codebase is using. Currently, the only supported framework is `nextjs`.
- `--plugins` - The plugins you want to use. You can specify multiple plugins by separating them with a comma.
- `--database` - The database you want to use. Currently, the only supported database is `sqlite`.
- `--package-manager` - The package manager you want to use. Currently, the only supported package managers are `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `bun`. (Defaults to the manager you used to initialize the CLI.)

## Secret

The CLI also provides a way to generate a secret key for your Better Auth instance.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx @better-auth/cli@latest secret
```

## Common Issues

**Error: Cannot find module X**

If you see this error, it means the CLI can’t resolve imported modules in your Better Auth config file. We're working on a fix for many of these issues, but in the meantime, you can try the following:

- Remove any import aliases in your config file and use relative paths instead. After running the CLI, you can revert to using aliases.

title: Client
description: Better Auth client library for authentication.
---

Better Auth offers a client library compatible with popular frontend frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte, and more. This client library includes a set of functions for interacting with the Better Auth server. Each framework's client library is built on top of a core client library that is framework-agnostic, so that all methods and hooks are consistently available across all client libraries.

## Installation

If you haven't already, install better-auth.

```package-install 
npm i better-auth
```

## Create Client Instance

Import `createAuthClient` from the package for your framework (e.g., "better-auth/react" for React). Call the function to create your client. Pass the base URL of your auth server. If the auth server is running on the same domain as your client, you can skip this step.

<Callout type="info">
If you're using a different base path other than `/api/auth`, make sure to pass the whole URL, including the path. (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/custom-path/auth`)

## Usage

Once you've created your client instance, you can use the client to interact with the Better Auth server. The client provides a set of functions by default and they can be extended with plugins.

**Example: Sign In**

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
const authClient = createAuthClient()

await authClient.signIn.email({
    email: "test@user.com",
    password: "password1234"
})
```

### Hooks

On top of normal methods, the client provides hooks to easily access different reactive data. Every hook is available in the root object of the client and they all start with `use`.

**Example: useSession**

            </Tab>

### Fetch Options

The client uses a library called [better fetch](https://better-fetch.vercel.app) to make requests to the server. 

Better fetch is a wrapper around the native fetch API that provides a more convenient way to make requests. It's created by the same team behind Better Auth and is designed to work seamlessly with it.

You can pass any default fetch options to the client by passing `fetchOptions` object to the `createAuthClient`.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"

const authClient = createAuthClient({
    fetchOptions: {
        //any better-fetch options
    },
})
```         

You can also pass fetch options to most of the client functions. Either as the second argument or as a property in the object.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
await authClient.signIn.email({
    email: "email@email.com",
    password: "password1234",
}, {
    onSuccess(ctx) {
            //      
    }
})

//or

await authClient.signIn.email({
    email: "email@email.com",
    password: "password1234",
    fetchOptions: {
        onSuccess(ctx) {
            //      
        }
    },
})
```


### Handling Errors

Most of the client functions return a response object with the following properties:
- `data`: The response data.
- `error`: The error object if there was an error.

the error object contains the following properties:
- `message`: The error message. (e.g., "Invalid email or password")
- `status`: The HTTP status code.
- `statusText`: The HTTP status text.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const { data, error } = await authClient.signIn.email({
    email: "email@email.com",
    password: "password1234"
})
if (error) {
    //handle error
}
```

If the actions accepts a `fetchOptions` option, you can pass `onError` callback to handle errors.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"

await authClient.signIn.email({
    email: "email@email.com",
    password: "password1234",
}, {
    onError(ctx) {
        //handle error
    }
})

//or
await authClient.signIn.email({
    email: "email@email.com",
    password: "password1234",
    fetchOptions: {
        onError(ctx) {
            //handle error
        }
    }
})
```

Hooks like `useSession` also return an error object if there was an error fetching the session. On top of that, they also return a `isPending` property to indicate if the request is still pending.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const { data, error, isPending } = useSession()
if (error) {
    //handle error
}
```

#### Error Codes

The client instance contains $ERROR_CODES object that contains all the error codes returned by the server. You can use this to handle error translations or custom error messages.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const authClient = createAuthClient();

type ErrorTypes = Partial<
	Record<
		keyof typeof authClient.$ERROR_CODES,
		{
			en: string;
			es: string;
		}
	>
>;

const errorCodes = {
	USER_ALREADY_EXISTS: {
		en: "user already registered",
		es: "usuario ya registrada",
	},
} satisfies ErrorTypes;

const getErrorMessage = (code: string, lang: "en" | "es") => {
	if (code in errorCodes) {
		return errorCodes[code as keyof typeof errorCodes][lang];
	}
	return "";
};


const { error } = await authClient.signUp.email({
	email: "user@email.com",
	password: "password",
	name: "User",
});
if(error?.code){
    alert(getErrorMessage(error.code, "en"));
}
```

### Plugins

You can extend the client with plugins to add more functionality. Plugins can add new functions to the client or modify existing ones. 

**Example: Magic Link Plugin**
```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
import { magicLinkClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

const authClient = createAuthClient({
    plugins: [
        magicLinkClient()
    ]
})
```

once you've added the plugin, you can use the new functions provided by the plugin.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
await authClient.signIn.magicLink({
    email: "test@email.com"
})
```

<file path="docs/better-auth/concepts/cookies.mdx">
---
title: Cookies
description: Learn how cookies are used in Better Auth.
---

Cookies are used to store data such as session tokens, OAuth state, and more. All cookies are signed using the `secret` key provided in the auth options.

### Cookie Prefix

Better Auth cookies will follow `${prefix}.${cookie_name}` format by default. The prefix will be "better-auth" by default. You can change the prefix by setting `cookiePrefix` in the `advanced` object of the auth options.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    advanced: {
        cookiePrefix: "my-app"
    }
})
```

### Custom Cookies

All cookies are `httpOnly` and `secure` if the server is running in production mode.

If you want to set custom cookie names and attributes, you can do so by setting `cookieOptions` in the `advanced` object of the auth options.

By default, Better Auth uses the following cookies:

- `session_token` to store the session token
- `session_data` to store the session data if cookie cache is enabled
- `dont_remember` to store the `dont_remember` flag if remember me is disabled

Plugins may also use cookies to store data. For example, the Two Factor Authentication plugin uses the `two_factor` cookie to store the two-factor authentication state.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    advanced: {
        cookies: {
            session_token: {
                name: "custom_session_token",
                attributes: {
                    // Set custom cookie attributes
                }
            },
        }
    }
})
```

### Cross Subdomain Cookies

Sometimes you may need to share cookies across subdomains. For example, if you have `app.example.com` and `auth.example.com`, and if you authenticate on `auth.example.com`, you may want to access the same session on `app.example.com`.

<Callout type="warn">
The `domain` attribute controls which domains can access the cookie. Setting it to your root domain (e.g. `example.com`) makes the cookie accessible across all subdomains. For security, you should:

1. Only enable cross-subdomain cookies if it's necessary
2. Set the domain to the most specific scope needed (e.g. `app.example.com` instead of `.example.com`)
3. Be cautious of untrusted subdomains that could potentially access these cookies
4. Consider using separate domains for untrusted services (e.g. `status.company.com` vs `app.company.com`)
</Callout>

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    advanced: {
        crossSubDomainCookies: {
            enabled: true,
            domain: "app.example.com", // your domain
        },
    },
    trustedOrigins: [
        'https://example.com',
        'https://app1.example.com',
        'https://app2.example.com',
    ],
})
```
### Secure Cookies

By default, cookies are secure only when the server is running in production mode. You can force cookies to be always secure by setting `useSecureCookies` to `true` in the `advanced` object in the auth options.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    advanced: {
        useSecureCookies: true
    }
})
```
</file>

<file path="docs/better-auth/concepts/database.mdx">

title: Database
description: Learn how to use a database with Better Auth.
---

## Adapters

Better Auth requires a database connection to store data. The database will be used to store data such as users, sessions, and more. Plugins can also define their own database tables to store data.

You can pass a database connection to Better Auth by passing a supported database instance in the database options. You can learn more about supported database adapters in the [Other relational databases](/docs/adapters/other-relational-databases) documentation.

## CLI

Better Auth comes with a CLI tool to manage database migrations and generate schema.

### Running Migrations

The cli checks your database and prompts you to add missing tables or update existing ones with new columns. This is only supported for the built-in Kysely adapter. For other adapters, you can use the `generate` command to create the schema and handle the migration through your ORM.

```bash
npx @better-auth/cli migrate
```

### Generating Schema

Better Auth also provides a `generate` command to generate the schema required by Better Auth. The `generate` command creates the schema required by Better Auth. If you're using a database adapter like Prisma or Drizzle, this command will generate the right schema for your ORM. If you're using the built-in Kysely adapter, it will generate an SQL file you can run directly on your database.

```bash
npx @better-auth/cli generate
```

See the [CLI](/docs/concepts/cli) documentation for more information on the CLI.

<Callout>
  If you prefer adding tables manually, you can do that as well. The core schema
  required by Better Auth is described below and you can find additional schema
  required by plugins in the plugin documentation.
</Callout>

## Secondary Storage

Secondary storage in Better Auth allows you to use key-value stores for managing session data, rate limiting counters, etc. This can be useful when you want to offload the storage of this intensive records to a high performance storage or even RAM.

### Implementation

To use secondary storage, implement the `SecondaryStorage` interface:

```typescript
interface SecondaryStorage {
  get: (key: string) => Promise<string | null>;
  set: (key: string, value: string, ttl?: number) => Promise<void>;
  delete: (key: string) => Promise<void>;
}
```

Then, provide your implementation to the `betterAuth` function:

```typescript
betterAuth({
  // ... other options
  secondaryStorage: {
    // Your implementation here
  },
});
```

**Example: Redis Implementation**

Here's a basic example using Redis:

```typescript
import { createClient } from "redis";
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

const redis = createClient();
await redis.connect();

export const auth = betterAuth({
	// ... other options
	secondaryStorage: {
		get: async (key) => {
			const value = await redis.get(key);
			return value ? value : null;
		},
		set: async (key, value, ttl) => {
			if (ttl) await redis.set(key, value, { EX: ttl });
			// or for ioredis:
			// if (ttl) await redis.set(key, value, 'EX', ttl)
			else await redis.set(key, value);
		},
		delete: async (key) => {
			await redis.del(key);
		}
	}
});
```

This implementation allows Better Auth to use Redis for storing session data and rate limiting counters. You can also add prefixes to the keys names.

## Core Schema

Better Auth requires the following tables to be present in the database. The types are in `typescript` format. You can use corresponding types in your database.

### User

Table Name: `user`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    {
      name: "id",

    {
      name: "updatedAt",
      type: "Date",
      description: "Timestamp of when the verification request was updated",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Custom Tables

Better Auth allows you to customize the table names and column names for the core schema. You can also extend the core schema by adding additional fields to the user and session tables.

### Custom Table Names

You can customize the table names and column names for the core schema by using the `modelName` and `fields` properties in your auth config:

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
  user: {
    modelName: "users",
    fields: {
      name: "full_name",
      email: "email_address",
    },
  },
  session: {
    modelName: "user_sessions",
    fields: {
      userId: "user_id",
    },
  },
});
```

<Callout>
  Type inference in your code will still use the original field names (e.g.,
  `user.name`, not `user.full_name`).
</Callout>

To customize table names and column name for plugins, you can use the `schema` property in the plugin config:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { twoFactor } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    twoFactor({
      schema: {
        user: {
          fields: {
            twoFactorEnabled: "two_factor_enabled",
            secret: "two_factor_secret",
          },
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Extending Core Schema

Better Auth provides a type-safe way to extend the `user` and `session` schemas. You can add custom fields to your auth config, and the CLI will automatically update the database schema. These additional fields will be properly inferred in functions like `useSession`, `signUp.email`, and other endpoints that work with user or session objects.

To add custom fields, use the `additionalFields` property in the `user` or `session` object of your auth config. The `additionalFields` object uses field names as keys, with each value being a `FieldAttributes` object containing:

- `type`: The data type of the field (e.g., "string", "number", "boolean").
- `required`: A boolean indicating if the field is mandatory.
- `defaultValue`: The default value for the field (note: this only applies in the JavaScript layer; in the database, the field will be optional).
- `input`: This determines whether a value can be provided when creating a new record (default: `true`). If there are additional fields, like `role`, that should not be provided by the user during signup, you can set this to `false`.

Here's an example of how to extend the user schema with additional fields:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  user: {
    additionalFields: {
      role: {
        type: "string",
        required: false,
        defaultValue: "user",
        input: false, // don't allow user to set role
      },
      lang: {
        type: "string",
        required: false,
        defaultValue: "en",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Now you can access the additional fields in your application logic.

```ts
//on signup
const res = await auth.api.signUpEmail({
  email: "test@example.com",
  password: "password",
  name: "John Doe",
  lang: "fr",
});

//user object
res.user.role; // > "admin"
res.user.lang; // > "fr"
```

<Callout>
  See the
  [TypeScript](/docs/concepts/typescript#inferring-additional-fields-on-client)
  documentation for more information on how to infer additional fields on the
  client side.
</Callout>

If you're using social / OAuth providers, you may want to provide `mapProfileToUser` to map the profile data to the user object. So, you can populate additional fields from the provider's profile.

**Example: Mapping Profile to User For `firstName` and `lastName`**

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  socialProviders: {
    github: {
      clientId: "YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID",
      clientSecret: "YOUR_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET",
      mapProfileToUser: (profile) => {
        return {
          firstName: profile.name.split(" ")[0],
          lastName: profile.name.split(" ")[1],
        };
      },
    },
    google: {
      clientId: "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID",
      clientSecret: "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET",
      mapProfileToUser: (profile) => {
        return {
          firstName: profile.given_name,
          lastName: profile.family_name,
        };
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### ID Generation

Better Auth by default will generate unique IDs for users, sessions, and other entities. If you want to customize how IDs are generated, you can configure this in the `advanced.database.generateId` option in your auth config.

You can also disable ID generation by setting the `advanced.database.generateId` option to `false`. This will assume your database will generate the ID automatically.

**Example: Automatic Database IDs**

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { db } from "./db";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: {
    db: db,
  },
  advanced: {
    database: {
      generateId: false,
    },
  },
});
```

### Database Hooks

Database hooks allow you to define custom logic that can be executed during the lifecycle of core database operations in Better Auth. You can create hooks for the following models: **user**, **session**, and **account**.

There are two types of hooks you can define:

#### 1. Before Hook

- **Purpose**: This hook is called before the respective entity (user, session, or account) is created or updated.
- **Behavior**: If the hook returns `false`, the operation will be aborted. And If it returns a data object, it'll replace the original payload.

#### 2. After Hook

- **Purpose**: This hook is called after the respective entity is created or updated.
- **Behavior**: You can perform additional actions or modifications after the entity has been successfully created or updated.

**Example Usage**

```typescript title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  databaseHooks: {
    user: {
      create: {
        before: async (user, ctx) => {
          // Modify the user object before it is created
          return {
            data: {
              ...user,
              firstName: user.name.split(" ")[0],
              lastName: user.name.split(" ")[1],
            },
          };
        },
        after: async (user) => {
          //perform additional actions, like creating a stripe customer
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

#### Throwing Errors

If you want to stop the database hook from proceeding, you can throw errors using the `APIError` class imported from `better-auth/api`.

```typescript title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { APIError } from "better-auth/api";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  databaseHooks: {
    user: {
      create: {
        before: async (user, ctx) => {
          if (user.isAgreedToTerms === false) {
            // Your special condition.
            // Send the API error.
            throw new APIError("BAD_REQUEST", {
              message: "User must agree to the TOS before signing up.",
            });
          }
          return {
            data: user,
          };
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

#### Using the Context Object

The context object (`ctx`), passed as the second argument to the hook, contains useful information. For `update` hooks, this includes the current `session`, which you can use to access the logged-in user's details.

```typescript title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  databaseHooks: {
    user: {
      update: {
        before: async (data, ctx) => {
          // You can access the session from the context object.
          if (ctx.context.session) {
            console.log("User update initiated by:", ctx.context.session.userId);
          }
          return { data };
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Much like standard hooks, database hooks also provide a `ctx` object that offers a variety of useful properties. Learn more in the [Hooks Documentation](/docs/concepts/hooks#ctx).

## Plugins Schema

Plugins can define their own tables in the database to store additional data. They can also add columns to the core tables to store additional data. For example, the two factor authentication plugin adds the following columns to the `user` table:

- `twoFactorEnabled`: Whether two factor authentication is enabled for the user.
- `twoFactorSecret`: The secret key used to generate TOTP codes.
- `twoFactorBackupCodes`: Encrypted backup codes for account recovery.

To add new tables and columns to your database, you have two options:

`CLI`: Use the migrate or generate command. These commands will scan your database and guide you through adding any missing tables or columns.
`Manual Method`: Follow the instructions in the plugin documentation to manually add tables and columns.

Both methods ensure your database schema stays up to date with your plugins' requirements.

description: Learn how to use email with Better Auth.
---

Email is a key part of Better Auth, required for all users regardless of their authentication method. Better Auth provides email and password authentication out of the box, and a lot of utilities to help you manage email verification, password reset, and more.


## Email Verification

Email verification is a security feature that ensures users provide a valid email address. It helps prevent spam and abuse by confirming that the email address belongs to the user. In this guide, you'll get a walk through of how to implement token based email verification in your app.
To use otp based email verification, check out the [OTP Verification](/docs/plugins/email-otp) guide.

### Adding Email Verification to Your App

To enable email verification, you need to pass a function that sends a verification email with a link.

- **sendVerificationEmail**: This function is triggered when email verification starts. It accepts a data object with the following properties:
  - `user`: The user object containing the email address.
  - `url`: The verification URL the user must click to verify their email.
  - `token`: The verification token used to complete the email verification to be used when implementing a custom verification URL.

and a `request` object as the second parameter.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from 'better-auth';
import { sendEmail } from './email'; // your email sending function

export const auth = betterAuth({
    emailVerification: {
        sendVerificationEmail: async ({ user, url, token }, request) => {
            await sendEmail({
                to: user.email,
                subject: 'Verify your email address',
                text: `Click the link to verify your email: ${url}`
            })
        }
    }
})
```

### Triggering Email Verification

You can initiate email verification in several ways:

#### 1. During Sign-up

To automatically send a verification email at signup, set `emailVerification.sendOnSignUp` to `true`. 

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from 'better-auth';

export const auth = betterAuth({
    emailVerification: {
        sendOnSignUp: true
    }
})
```

This sends a verification email when a user signs up. For social logins, email verification status is read from the SSO.

<Callout>
    With `sendOnSignUp` enabled, when the user logs in with an SSO that does not claim the email as verified, Better Auth will dispatch a verification email, but the verification is not required to login even when `requireEmailVerification` is enabled.
</Callout>

#### 2. Require Email Verification

If you enable require email verification, users must verify their email before they can log in. And every time a user tries to sign in, `sendVerificationEmail` is called.

<Callout>
    This only works if you have `sendVerificationEmail` implemented and if the user is trying to sign in with email and password.
</Callout>

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    emailAndPassword: {
        requireEmailVerification: true
    }
})
```

if a user tries to sign in without verifying their email, you can handle the error and show a message to the user.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
await authClient.signIn.email({
    email: "email@example.com",
    password: "password"
}, {
    onError: (ctx) => {
        // Handle the error
        if(ctx.error.status === 403) {
            alert("Please verify your email address")
        }
        //you can also show the original error message
        alert(ctx.error.message)
    }
})
```

#### 3. Manually

You can also manually trigger email verification by calling `sendVerificationEmail`.

```ts
await authClient.sendVerificationEmail({
    email: "user@email.com",
    callbackURL: "/" // The redirect URL after verification
})
```

### Verifying the Email

If the user clicks the provided verification URL, their email is automatically verified, and they are redirected to the `callbackURL`.

For manual verification, you can send the user a custom link with the `token` and call the `verifyEmail` function.

```ts
await authClient.verifyEmail({
    query: {
        token: "" // Pass the token here
    }
})
```

### Auto SignIn After Verification

To sign in the user automatically after they successfully verify their email, set the `autoSignInAfterVerification` option to `true`:

```ts
const auth = betterAuth({
    //...your other options
    emailVerification: {
        autoSignInAfterVerification: true
    }
})
```

### Callback after successful email verification

You can run custom code immediately after a user verifies their email using the `afterEmailVerification` callback. This is useful for any side-effects you want to trigger, like granting access to special features or logging the event.

The `afterEmailVerification` function runs automatically when a user's email is confirmed, receiving the `user` object and `request` details so you can perform actions for that specific user.

Here's how you can set it up:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from 'better-auth';

export const auth = betterAuth({
    emailVerification: {
        async afterEmailVerification(user, request) {
            // Your custom logic here, e.g., grant access to premium features
            console.log(`${user.email} has been successfully verified!`);
        }
    }
})
```

## Password Reset Email

Password reset allows users to reset their password if they forget it. Better Auth provides a simple way to implement password reset functionality.

You can enable password reset by passing a function that sends a password reset email with a link.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from 'better-auth';
import { sendEmail } from './email'; // your email sending function

export const auth = betterAuth({
    emailAndPassword: {
        enabled: true,
        sendResetPassword: async ({ user, url, token }, request) => {
            await sendEmail({
                to: user.email,
                subject: 'Reset your password',
                text: `Click the link to reset your password: ${url}`
            })
        }
    }
})
```

Check out the [Email and Password](/docs/authentication/email-password#forget-password) guide for more details on how to implement password reset in your app.
Also you can check out the [Otp verification](/docs/plugins/email-otp#reset-password) guide for how to implement password reset with OTP in your app.

title: Hooks
description: Better Auth Hooks let you customize BetterAuth's behavior
---

Hooks in Better Auth let you "hook into" the lifecycle and execute custom logic. They provide a way to customize Better Auth's behavior without writing a full plugin. 

<Callout>
We highly recommend using hooks if you need to make custom adjustments to an endpoint rather than making another endpoint outside of Better Auth.
</Callout>

## Before Hooks

**Before hooks** run *before* an endpoint is executed. Use them to modify requests, pre validate data, or return early.

### Example: Enforce Email Domain Restriction

This hook ensures that users can only sign up if their email ends with `@example.com`:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { createAuthMiddleware, APIError } from "better-auth/api";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    hooks: {
        before: createAuthMiddleware(async (ctx) => {
            if (ctx.path !== "/sign-up/email") {
                return;
            }
            if (!ctx.body?.email.endsWith("@example.com")) {
                throw new APIError("BAD_REQUEST", {
                    message: "Email must end with @example.com",
                });
            }
        }),
    },
});
```

### Example: Modify Request Context

To adjust the request context before proceeding:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { createAuthMiddleware } from "better-auth/api";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    hooks: {
        before: createAuthMiddleware(async (ctx) => {
            if (ctx.path === "/sign-up/email") {
                return {
                    context: {
                        ...ctx,
                        body: {
                            ...ctx.body,
                            name: "John Doe",
                        },
                    }
                };
            }
        }),
    },
});
```

## After Hooks

**After hooks** run *after* an endpoint is executed. Use them to modify responses.

### Example: Send a notification to your channel when a new user is registered

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { createAuthMiddleware } from "better-auth/api";
import { sendMessage } from "@/lib/notification"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    hooks: {
        after: createAuthMiddleware(async (ctx) => {
            if(ctx.path.startsWith("/sign-up")){
                const newSession = ctx.context.newSession;
                if(newSession){
                    sendMessage({
                        type: "user-register",
                        name: newSession.user.name,
                    })
                }
            }
        }),
    },
});
```

## Ctx

When you call `createAuthMiddleware` a `ctx` object is passed that provides a lot of useful properties. Including:

- **Path:** `ctx.path` to get the current endpoint path.
- **Body:** `ctx.body` for parsed request body (available for POST requests).
- **Headers:** `ctx.headers` to access request headers.
- **Request:** `ctx.request` to access the request object (may not exist in server-only endpoints).
- **Query Parameters:** `ctx.query` to access query parameters.
- **Context**: `ctx.context` auth related context, useful for accessing new session, auth cookies configuration, password hashing, config...

and more.

### Request Response

This utilities allows you to get request information and to send response from a hook. 

#### JSON Responses

Use `ctx.json` to send JSON responses:

```ts
const hook = createAuthMiddleware(async (ctx) => {
    return ctx.json({
        message: "Hello World",
    });
});
```

#### Redirects

Use `ctx.redirect` to redirect users:

```ts
import { createAuthMiddleware } from "better-auth/api";

const hook = createAuthMiddleware(async (ctx) => {
    throw ctx.redirect("/sign-up/name");
});
```

#### Cookies

- Set cookies: `ctx.setCookies` or `ctx.setSignedCookie`.
- Get cookies: `ctx.getCookies` or `ctx.getSignedCookies`.

Example:

```ts
import { createAuthMiddleware } from "better-auth/api";

const hook = createAuthMiddleware(async (ctx) => {
    ctx.setCookies("my-cookie", "value");
    await ctx.setSignedCookie("my-signed-cookie", "value", ctx.context.secret, {
        maxAge: 1000,
    });

    const cookie = ctx.getCookies("my-cookie");
    const signedCookie = await ctx.getSignedCookies("my-signed-cookie");
});
```

#### Errors

Throw errors with `APIError` for a specific status code and message:

```ts
import { createAuthMiddleware, APIError } from "better-auth/api";

const hook = createAuthMiddleware(async (ctx) => {
    throw new APIError("BAD_REQUEST", {
        message: "Invalid request",
    });
});
```



### Context

The `ctx` object contains another `context` object inside that's meant to hold contexts related to auth. Including a newly created session on after hook, cookies configuration, password hasher and so on. 

#### New Session

The newly created session after an endpoint is run. This only exist in after hook.

```ts title="auth.ts"
createAuthMiddleware(async (ctx) => {
    const newSession = ctx.context.newSession
});
```

#### Returned

The returned value from the hook is passed to the next hook in the chain.

```ts title="auth.ts"
createAuthMiddleware(async (ctx) => {
    const returned = ctx.context.returned; //this could be a successful response or an APIError
});
```

#### Response Headers

The response headers added by endpoints and hooks that run before this hook.

```ts title="auth.ts"
createAuthMiddleware(async (ctx) => {
    const responseHeaders = ctx.context.responseHeaders;
});
```

#### Predefined Auth Cookies

Access BetterAuth’s predefined cookie properties:

```ts title="auth.ts"
createAuthMiddleware(async (ctx) => {
    const cookieName = ctx.context.authCookies.sessionToken.name;
});
```

#### Secret

You can access the `secret` for your auth instance on `ctx.context.secret`

#### Password

The password object provider `hash` and `verify`

- `ctx.context.password.hash`: let's you hash a given password.
- `ctx.context.password.verify`: let's you verify given `password` and a `hash`.

#### Adapter

Adapter exposes the adapter methods used by Better Auth. Including `findOne`, `findMany`, `create`, `delete`, `update` and `updateMany`. You generally should use your actually `db` instance from your orm rather than this adapter.


#### Internal Adapter

These are calls to your db that perform specific actions. `createUser`, `createSession`, `updateSession`...

This may be useful to use instead of using your db directly to get access to `databaseHooks`, proper `secondaryStorage` support and so on. If you're make a query similar to what exist in this internal adapter actions it's worth a look.

#### generateId

You can use `ctx.context.generateId` to generate Id for various reasons.

## Reusable Hooks

If you need to reuse a hook across multiple endpoints, consider creating a plugin. Learn more in the [Plugins Documentation](/docs/concepts/plugins).

title: OAuth
description: How Better Auth handles OAuth
---

Better Auth comes with built-in support for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. This allows you to authenticate users via popular OAuth providers like Google, Facebook, GitHub, and more.

If your desired provider isn't directly supported, you can use the [Generic OAuth Plugin](/docs/plugins/generic-oauth) for custom integrations.

## Configuring Social Providers

To enable a social provider, you need to provide `clientId` and `clientSecret` for the provider.

Here's an example of how to configure Google as a provider:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  // Other configurations...
  socialProviders: {
    google: {
      clientId: "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID",
      clientSecret: "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET",
    },
  },
});
```

## Usage

### Sign In

To sign in with a social provider, you can use the `signIn.social` function with the `authClient` or `auth.api` for server-side usage.

```ts
// client-side usage
await authClient.signIn.social({
  provider: "google", // or any other provider id
})
```

```ts
// server-side usage
await auth.api.signInSocial({
  body: {
    provider: "google", // or any other provider id
  },
});
```

### Link account

To link an account to a social provider, you can use the `linkAccount` function with the `authClient` or `auth.api` for server-side usage.

```ts
await authClient.linkSocial({
  provider: "google", // or any other provider id
})
```

server-side usage:

```ts
await auth.api.linkSocialAccount({
  body: {
    provider: "google", // or any other provider id
  },
  headers: // pass headers with authenticated token
});
```

### Get Access Token

To get the access token for a social provider, you can use the `getAccessToken` function with the `authClient` or `auth.api` for server-side usage. When you use this endpoint, if the access token is expired, it will be refreshed.

```ts
const { accessToken } = await authClient.getAccessToken({
  providerId: "google", // or any other provider id
  accountId: "accountId", // optional, if you want to get the access token for a specific account
})
```

server-side usage:

```ts
await auth.api.getAccessToken({
  body: {
    providerId: "google", // or any other provider id
    accountId: "accountId", // optional, if you want to get the access token for a specific account
    userId: "userId", // optional, if you don't provide headers with authenticated token
  },
  headers: // pass headers with authenticated token
});
```

### Get Account Info Provided by the provider

To get provider specific account info you can use the `accountInfo` function with the `authClient` or `auth.api` for server-side usage.

```ts
const info = await authClient.accountInfo({
  accountId: "accountId", // here you pass in the provider given account id, the provider is automatically detected from the account id
})
```

server-side usage:

```ts
await auth.api.accountInfo({
  body: { accountId: "accountId" },
  headers: // pass headers with authenticated token
});
```

### Requesting Additional Scopes

Sometimes your application may need additional OAuth scopes after the user has already signed up (e.g., for accessing GitHub repositories or Google Drive). Users may not want to grant extensive permissions initially, preferring to start with minimal permissions and grant additional access as needed.

You can request additional scopes by using the `linkSocial` method with the same provider. This will trigger a new OAuth flow that requests the additional scopes while maintaining the existing account connection.

```ts
const requestAdditionalScopes = async () => {
    await authClient.linkSocial({
        provider: "google",
        scopes: ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file"],
    });
};
```

<Callout>
Make sure you're running Better Auth version 1.2.7 or later. Earlier versions (like 1.2.2) may show a "Social account already linked" error when trying to link with an existing provider for additional scopes.
</Callout>

### Other Provider Configurations

**scope** The scope of the access request. For example, `email` or `profile`.

**redirectURI** Custom redirect URI for the provider. By default, it uses `/api/auth/callback/${providerName}`.

**disableImplicitSignUp:** Disables implicit sign-up. In order to sign up a user, `requestSignUp` needs to be set to `true` when signing in.

**disableSignUp:** Disables sign-up for new users.

**disableIdTokenSignIn:** Disables the use of the ID token for sign-in. By default, it's enabled for some providers like Google and Apple.

**verifyIdToken** A custom function to verify the ID token.

**getUserInfo** A custom function to fetch user information from the provider. Given the tokens returned from the provider, this function should return the user's information.

**overrideUserInfoOnSignIn**: A boolean value that determines whether to override the user information in the database when signing in. By default, it is set to `false`, meaning that the user information will not be overridden during sign-in. If you want to update the user information every time they sign in, set this to `true`.

**refreshAccessToken**: A custom function to refresh the token. This feature is only supported for built-in social providers (Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.) and is not currently supported for custom OAuth providers configured through the Generic OAuth Plugin. For built-in providers, you can provide a custom function to refresh the token if needed.

**mapProfileToUser** A custom function to map the user profile returned from the provider to the user object in your database.

Useful, if you have additional fields in your user object you want to populate from the provider's profile. Or if you want to change how by default the user object is mapped.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  // Other configurations...
  socialProviders: {
    google: {
      clientId: "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID",
      clientSecret: "YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET",
      mapProfileToUser: (profile) => {
        return {
          firstName: profile.given_name,
          lastName: profile.family_name,
        };
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## How OAuth Works in Better Auth

Here's what happens when a user selects a provider to authenticate with:

1. **Configuration Check:** Ensure the necessary provider details (e.g., client ID, secret) are configured.
2. **State Generation:** Generate and save a state token in your database for CSRF protection.
3. **PKCE Support:** If applicable, create a PKCE code challenge and verifier for secure exchanges.
4. **Authorization URL Construction:** Build the provider's authorization URL with parameters like client ID, redirect URI, state, etc. The callback URL usually follows the pattern `/api/auth/callback/${providerName}`.
5. **User Redirection:**
   - If redirection is enabled, users are redirected to the provider's login page.
   - If redirection is disabled, the authorization URL is returned for the client to handle the redirection.

### Post-Login Flow

After the user completes the login process, the provider redirects them back to the callback URL with a code and state. Better Auth handles the rest:

1. **Token Exchange:** The code is exchanged for an access token and user information.
2. **User Handling:**
   - If the user doesn't exist, a new account is created.
   - If the user exists, they are logged in.
   - If the user has multiple accounts across providers, Better Auth links them based on your configuration. Learn more about [account linking](/docs/concepts/users-accounts#account-linking).
3. **Session Creation:** A new session is created for the user.
4. **Redirect:** Users are redirected to the specified URL provided during the initial request or `/`.

If any error occurs during the process, Better Auth handles it and redirects the user to the error URL (if provided) or the callbackURL. And it includes the error message in the query string `?error=...`.

title: Plugins
description: Learn how to use plugins with Better Auth.
---

Plugins are a key part of Better Auth, they let you extend the base functionalities. You can use them to add new authentication methods, features, or customize behaviors.

Better Auth comes with many built-in plugins ready to use. Check the plugins section for details. You can also create your own plugins.

## Using a Plugin

Plugins can be a server-side plugin, a client-side plugin, or both.

To add a plugin on the server, include it in the `plugins` array in your auth configuration. The plugin will initialize with the provided options.

```ts title="server.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        // Add your plugins here
    ]
});
```

Client plugins are added when creating the client. Most plugin require both server and client plugins to work correctly.
The Better Auth auth client on the frontend uses the `createAuthClient` function provided by `better-auth/client`.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";

const authClient =  createAuthClient({
    plugins: [
        // Add your client plugins here
    ]
});
```

We recommend keeping the auth-client and your normal auth instance in separate files.
<Files>
  <Folder name="auth" defaultOpen>
    <File name="server.ts" />
    <File name="auth-client.ts" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

## Creating a Plugin

To get started, you'll need a server plugin.
Server plugins are the backbone of all plugins, and client plugins are there to provide an interface with frontend APIs to easily work with your server plugins.

<Callout type="info">
    If your server plugins has endpoints that needs to be called from the client, you'll also need to create a client plugin.
</Callout>

### What can a plugin do?

* Create custom `endpoint`s to perform any action you want.
* Extend database tables with custom `schemas`.
* Use a `middleware` to target a group of routes using it's route matcher, and run only when those routes are called through a request.
* Use `hooks` to target a specific route or request. And if you want to run the hook even if the endpoint is called directly.
* Use `onRequest` or `onResponse` if you want to do something that affects all requests or responses.
* Create custom `rate-limit` rule.

## Create a Server plugin

To create a server plugin you need to pass an object that satisfies the `BetterAuthPlugin` interface.

The only required property is `id`, which is a unique identifier for the plugin.
Both server and client plugins can use the same `id`.

```ts title="plugin.ts"
import type { BetterAuthPlugin } from "better-auth";

export const myPlugin = ()=>{
    return {
        id: "my-plugin",
    } satisfies BetterAuthPlugin
}
```
<Callout>
    You don't have to make the plugin a function, but it's recommended to do so. This way you can pass options to the plugin and it's consistent with the built-in plugins.
</Callout>

### Endpoints

To add endpoints to the server, you can pass `endpoints` which requires an object with the key being any `string` and the value being an `AuthEndpoint`.

To create an Auth Endpoint you'll need to import `createAuthEndpoint` from `better-auth`.

Better Auth uses wraps around another library called <Link href="https://github.com/bekacru/better-call"> Better Call </Link> to create endpoints. Better call is a simple ts web framework made by the same team behind Better Auth.

```ts title="plugin.ts"
import { createAuthEndpoint } from "better-auth/api";

const myPlugin = ()=> {
    return {
        id: "my-plugin",
        endpoints: {
            getHelloWorld: createAuthEndpoint("/my-plugin/hello-world", {
                method: "GET",
            }, async(ctx) => {
                return ctx.json({
                    message: "Hello World"
                })
            })
        }
    } satisfies BetterAuthPlugin
}
```

Create Auth endpoints wraps around `createEndpoint` from Better Call. Inside the `ctx` object, it'll provide another object called `context` that give you access better-auth specific contexts including `options`, `db`, `baseURL` and more.

**Context Object**

- `appName`: The name of the application. Defaults to "Better Auth".
- `options`: The options passed to the Better Auth instance.
- `tables`:  Core tables definition. It is an object which has the table name as the key and the schema definition as the value.
- `baseURL`: the baseURL of the auth server. This includes the path. For example, if the server is running on `http://localhost:3000`, the baseURL will be `http://localhost:3000/api/auth` by default unless changed by the user.
- `session`: The session configuration. Includes `updateAge` and `expiresIn` values.
- `secret`: The secret key used for various purposes. This is defined by the user.
- `authCookie`: The default cookie configuration for core auth cookies.
- `logger`: The logger instance used by Better Auth.
- `db`: The Kysely instance used by Better Auth to interact with the database.
- `adapter`: This is the same as db but it give you `orm` like functions to interact with the database. (we recommend using this over `db` unless you need raw sql queries or for performance reasons)
- `internalAdapter`: These are internal db calls that are used by Better Auth. For example, you can use these calls to create a session instead of using `adapter` directly. `internalAdapter.createSession(userId)`
- `createAuthCookie`: This is a helper function that let's you get a cookie `name` and `options` for either to `set` or `get` cookies. It implements things like `__secure` prefix and `__host` prefix for cookies based on

**Rules for Endpoints**

- Makes sure you use kebab-case for the endpoint path
- Make sure to only use `POST` or `GET` methods for the endpoints.
- Any function that modifies a data should be a `POST` method.
- Any function that fetches data should be a `GET` method.
- Make sure to use the `createAuthEndpoint` function to create API endpoints.
- Make sure your paths are unique to avoid conflicts with other plugins. If you're using a common path, add the plugin name as a prefix to the path. (`/my-plugin/hello-world` instead of `/hello-world`.)

### Schema

You can define a database schema for your plugin by passing a `schema` object. The schema object should have the table name as the key and the schema definition as the value.

```ts title="plugin.ts"
import { BetterAuthPlugin } from "better-auth/plugins";

const myPlugin = ()=> {
    return {
        id: "my-plugin",
        schema: {
            myTable: {
                fields: {
                    name: {
                        type: "string"
                    }
                },
                modelName: "myTable" // optional if you want to use a different name than the key
            }
        }
    } satisfies BetterAuthPlugin
}
```

**Fields**

By default better-auth will create an `id` field for each table. You can add additional fields to the table by adding them to the `fields` object.

The key is the column name and the value is the column definition. The column definition can have the following properties:

`type`: The type of the field. It can be `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `date`.

`required`:  if the field should be required on a new record. (default: `false`)

`unique`: if the field should be unique. (default: `false`)

`reference`: if the field is a reference to another table. (default: `null`) It takes an object with the following properties:
    - `model`: The table name to reference.
    - `field`: The field name to reference.
    - `onDelete`: The action to take when the referenced record is deleted. (default: `null`)

**Other Schema Properties**

`disableMigration`: if the table should not be migrated. (default: `false`)

```ts title="plugin.ts"
const myPlugin = (opts: PluginOptions)=>{
    return {
        id: "my-plugin",
        schema: {
            rateLimit: {
                fields: {
                    key: {
                        type: "string",
                    },
                },
                disableMigration: opts.storage.provider !== "database", // [!code highlight]
            },
        },
    } satisfies BetterAuthPlugin
}
```

if you add additional fields to a `user` or `session` table, the types will be inferred automatically on `getSession` and `signUpEmail` calls.

```ts title="plugin.ts"

const myPlugin = ()=>{
    return {
        id: "my-plugin",
        schema: {
            user: {
                fields: {
                    age: {
                        type: "number",
                    },
                },
            },
        },
    } satisfies BetterAuthPlugin
}
```

This will add an `age` field to the `user` table and all `user` returning endpoints will include the `age` field and it'll be inferred properly by typescript.

<Callout type="warn">
Don't store sensitive information in `user` or `session` table. Crate a new table if you need to store sensitive information.
</Callout>

### Hooks

Hooks are used to run code before or after an action is performed, either from a client or directly on the server. You can add hooks to the server by passing a `hooks` object, which should contain `before` and `after` properties.

```ts title="plugin.ts"
import {  createAuthMiddleware } from "better-auth/plugins";

const myPlugin = ()=>{
    return {
        id: "my-plugin",
        hooks: {
            before: [{
                    matcher: (context)=>{
                        return context.headers.get("x-my-header") === "my-value"
                    },
                    handler: createAuthMiddleware(async (ctx)=>{
                        //do something before the request
                        return  {
                            context: ctx // if you want to modify the context
                        }
                    })
                }],
            after: [{
                matcher: (context)=>{
                    return context.path === "/sign-up/email"
                },
                handler: createAuthMiddleware(async (ctx)=>{
                    return ctx.json({
                        message: "Hello World"
                    }) // if you want to modify the response
                })
            }]
        }
    } satisfies BetterAuthPlugin
}
```

### Middleware

You can add middleware to the server by passing a `middlewares` array. This array should contain middleware objects, each with a `path` and a `middleware` property. Unlike hooks, middleware only runs on `api` requests from a client. If the endpoint is invoked directly, the middleware will not run.

The `path` can be either a string or a path matcher, using the same path-matching system as `better-call`.

If you throw an `APIError` from the middleware or returned a `Response` object, the request will be stopped and the response will be sent to the client.

```ts title="plugin.ts"
const myPlugin = ()=>{
    return {
        id: "my-plugin",
        middlewares: [
            {
                path: "/my-plugin/hello-world",
                middleware: createAuthMiddleware(async(ctx)=>{
                    //do something
                })
            }
        ]
    } satisfies BetterAuthPlugin
}
```


### On Request & On Response

Additional to middlewares, you can also hook into right before a request is made and right after a response is returned. This is mostly useful if you want to do something that affects all requests or responses.

#### On Request

The `onRequest` function is called right before the request is made. It takes two parameters: the `request` and the `context` object.

Here’s how it works:

- **Continue as Normal**: If you don't return anything, the request will proceed as usual.
- **Interrupt the Request**: To stop the request and send a response, return an object with a `response` property that contains a `Response` object.
- **Modify the Request**: You can also return a modified `request` object to change the request before it's sent.

```ts title="plugin.ts"
const myPlugin = ()=> {
    return  {
        id: "my-plugin",
        onRequest: async (request, context) => {
            //do something
        },
    } satisfies BetterAuthPlugin
}
```

#### On Response

The `onResponse` function is executed immediately after a response is returned. It takes two parameters: the `response` and the `context` object.

Here’s how to use it:

- **Modify the Response**: You can return a modified response object to change the response before it is sent to the client.
- **Continue Normally**: If you don't return anything, the response will be sent as is.

```ts title="plugin.ts"
const myPlugin = ()=>{
    return {
        id: "my-plugin",
        onResponse: async (response, context) => {
            //do something
        },
    } satisfies BetterAuthPlugin
}
```

### Rate Limit

You can define custom rate limit rules for your plugin by passing a `rateLimit` array. The rate limit array should contain an array of rate limit objects.

```ts title="plugin.ts"
const myPlugin = ()=>{
    return {
        id: "my-plugin",
        rateLimit: [
            {
                pathMatcher: (path)=>{
                    return path === "/my-plugin/hello-world"
                },
                limit: 10,
                window: 60,
            }
        ]
    } satisfies BetterAuthPlugin
}
```

### Server-plugin helper functions

Some additional helper functions for creating server plugins.

#### `getSessionFromCtx`

Allows you to get the client's session data by passing the auth middleware's `context`.

```ts title="plugin.ts"
import {  createAuthMiddleware } from "better-auth/plugins";

const myPlugin = {
    id: "my-plugin",
    hooks: {
        before: [{
                matcher: (context)=>{
                    return context.headers.get("x-my-header") === "my-value"
                },
                handler: createAuthMiddleware(async (ctx) => {
                    const session = await getSessionFromCtx(ctx);
                    //do something with the client's session.

                    return  {
                        context: ctx
                    }
                })
            }],
    }
} satisfies BetterAuthPlugin
```

#### `sessionMiddleware`

A middleware that checks if the client has a valid session. If the client has a valid session, it'll add the session data to the context object.

```ts title="plugin.ts"
import { createAuthMiddleware } from "better-auth/plugins";
import { sessionMiddleware } from "better-auth/api";

const myPlugin = ()=>{
    return {
        id: "my-plugin",
        endpoints: {
            getHelloWorld: createAuthEndpoint("/my-plugin/hello-world", {
                method: "GET",
                use: [sessionMiddleware], // [!code highlight]
            }, async(ctx) => {
                const session = ctx.context.session;
                return ctx.json({
                    message: "Hello World"
                })
            })
        }
    } satisfies BetterAuthPlugin
}
```


## Creating a client plugin

If your endpoints needs to be called from the client, you'll need to also create a client plugin. Better Auth clients can infer the endpoints from the server plugins. You can also add additional client side logic.

```ts title="client-plugin.ts"
import type { BetterAuthClientPlugin } from "better-auth";

export const myPluginClient = ()=>{
    return {
        id: "my-plugin",
    } satisfies BetterAuthClientPlugin
}
```

### Endpoint Interface

Endpoints are inferred from the server plugin by adding a `$InferServerPlugin` key to the client plugin.

The client infers the `path` as an object and converts kebab-case to camelCase. For example, `/my-plugin/hello-world` becomes `myPlugin.helloWorld`.

```ts title="client-plugin.ts"
import type { BetterAuthClientPlugin } from "better-auth/client";
import type { myPlugin } from "./plugin";

const myPluginClient = ()=> {
    return  {
        id: "my-plugin",
        $InferServerPlugin: {} as ReturnType<typeof myPlugin>,
    } satisfies BetterAuthClientPlugin
}
```

### Get actions

If you need to add additional methods or what not to the client you can use the `getActions` function. This function is called with the `fetch` function from the client.

Better Auth uses <Link href="https://better-fetch.vercel.app"> Better fetch </Link> to make requests. Better fetch is a simple fetch wrapper made by the same author of Better Auth.

```ts title="client-plugin.ts"
import type { BetterAuthClientPlugin } from "better-auth/client";
import type { myPlugin } from "./plugin";
import type { BetterFetchOption } from "@better-fetch/fetch";

const myPluginClient = {
    id: "my-plugin",
    $InferServerPlugin: {} as ReturnType<typeof myPlugin>,
    getActions: ($fetch)=>{
        return {
            myCustomAction: async (data: {
                foo: string,
            }, fetchOptions?: BetterFetchOption)=>{
                const res = $fetch("/custom/action", {
                    method: "POST",
                    body: {
                        foo: data.foo
                    },
                    ...fetchOptions
                })
                return res
            }
        }
    }
} satisfies BetterAuthClientPlugin
```

<Callout>
As a general guideline, ensure that each function accepts only one argument, with an optional second argument for fetchOptions to allow users to pass additional options to the fetch call. The function should return an object containing data and error keys.

If your use case involves actions beyond API calls, feel free to deviate from this rule.
</Callout>

### Get Atoms

This is only useful if you want to provide `hooks` like `useSession`.

Get atoms is called with the `fetch` function from better fetch and it should return an object with the atoms. The atoms should be created using <Link href="https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores">nanostores</Link>. The atoms will be resolved by each framework `useStore` hook provided by nanostores.

```ts title="client-plugin.ts"
import { atom } from "nanostores";
import type { BetterAuthClientPlugin } from "better-auth/client";

const myPluginClient = {
    id: "my-plugin",
    $InferServerPlugin: {} as ReturnType<typeof myPlugin>,
    getAtoms: ($fetch)=>{
        const myAtom = atom<null>()
        return {
            myAtom
        }
    }
} satisfies BetterAuthClientPlugin
```

See built-in plugins for examples of how to use atoms properly.

### Path methods

By default, inferred paths use `GET` method if they don't require a body and `POST` if they do. You can override this by passing a `pathMethods` object. The key should be the path and the value should be the method ("POST" | "GET").

```ts title="client-plugin.ts"
import type { BetterAuthClientPlugin } from "better-auth/client";
import type { myPlugin } from "./plugin";

const myPluginClient = {
    id: "my-plugin",
    $InferServerPlugin: {} as ReturnType<typeof myPlugin>,
    pathMethods: {
        "/my-plugin/hello-world": "POST"
    }
} satisfies BetterAuthClientPlugin
```

### Fetch plugins

If you need to use better fetch plugins you can pass them to the `fetchPlugins` array. You can read more about better fetch plugins in the <Link href="https://better-fetch.vercel.app/docs/plugins">better fetch documentation</Link>.

### Atom Listeners

This is only useful if you want to provide `hooks` like `useSession` and you want to listen to atoms and re-evaluate them when they change.

You can see how this is used in the built-in plugins.

title: Rate Limit
description: How to limit the number of requests a user can make to the server in a given time period.
---

Better Auth includes a built-in rate limiter to help manage traffic and prevent abuse. By default, in production mode, the rate limiter is set to:

- Window: 60 seconds
- Max Requests: 100 requests

<Callout type="warning">
Server-side requests made using `auth.api` aren't affected by rate limiting. Rate limits only apply to client-initiated requests.
</Callout>

You can easily customize these settings by passing the rateLimit object to the betterAuth function.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    rateLimit: {
        window: 10, // time window in seconds
        max: 100, // max requests in the window
    },
})
```

Rate limiting is disabled in development mode by default. In order to enable it, set `enabled` to `true`:

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    rateLimit: {
        enabled: true,
        //...other options
    },
})
```

In addition to the default settings, Better Auth provides custom rules for specific paths. For example:
- `/sign-in/email`: Is limited to 3 requests within 10 seconds.

In addition, plugins also define custom rules for specific paths. For example, `twoFactor` plugin has custom rules:
- `/two-factor/verify`: Is limited to 3 requests within 10 seconds.

These custom rules ensure that sensitive operations are protected with stricter limits.

## Configuring Rate Limit

### Connecting IP Address

Rate limiting uses the connecting IP address to track the number of requests made by a user. The
default header checked is `x-forwarded-for`, which is commonly used in production environments. If
you are using a different header to track the user's IP address, you'll need to specify it.

```ts title="auth.ts" 
export const auth = betterAuth({
    //...other options
    advanced: {
        ipAddress: {
          ipAddressHeaders: ["cf-connecting-ip"], // Cloudflare specific header example
      },
    },
    rateLimit: {
        enabled: true,
        window: 60, // time window in seconds
        max: 100, // max requests in the window
    },
})
```

### Rate Limit Window

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    //...other options
    rateLimit: {
        window: 60, // time window in seconds
        max: 100, // max requests in the window
    },
})
```

You can also pass custom rules for specific paths.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    //...other options
    rateLimit: {
        window: 60, // time window in seconds
        max: 100, // max requests in the window
        customRules: {
            "/sign-in/email": {
                window: 10,
                max: 3,
            },
            "/two-factor/*": async (request)=> {
                // custom function to return rate limit window and max
                return {
                    window: 10,
                    max: 3,
                }
            }
        },
    },
})
```

### Storage

By default, rate limit data is stored in memory, which may not be suitable for many use cases, particularly in serverless environments. To address this, you can use a database, secondary storage, or custom storage for storing rate limit data.

**Using Database**

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    //...other options
    rateLimit: {
        storage: "database",
        modelName: "rateLimit", //optional by default "rateLimit" is used
    },
})
```

Make sure to run `migrate` to create the rate limit table in your database.

```bash
npx @better-auth/cli migrate
```

**Using Secondary Storage**

If a [Secondary Storage](/docs/concepts/database#secondary-storage) has been configured you can use that to store rate limit data.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    //...other options
    rateLimit: {
		storage: "secondary-storage"
    },
})
```

**Custom Storage**

If none of the above solutions suits your use case you can implement a `customStorage`.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    //...other options
    rateLimit: {
        customStorage: {
            get: async (key) => {
                // get rate limit data
            },
            set: async (key, value) => {
                // set rate limit data
            },
        },
    },
})
```

## Handling Rate Limit Errors

When a request exceeds the rate limit, Better Auth returns the following header:

- `X-Retry-After`: The number of seconds until the user can make another request.

To handle rate limit errors on the client side, you can manage them either globally or on a per-request basis. Since Better Auth clients wrap over Better Fetch, you can pass `fetchOptions` to handle rate limit errors

**Global Handling**

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
    fetchOptions: {
        onError: async (context) => {
            const { response } = context;
            if (response.status === 429) {
                const retryAfter = response.headers.get("X-Retry-After");
                console.log(`Rate limit exceeded. Retry after ${retryAfter} seconds`);
            }
        },
    }
})
```


**Per Request Handling**

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { authClient } from "./auth-client";

await authClient.signIn.email({
    fetchOptions: {
        onError: async (context) => {
            const { response } = context;
            if (response.status === 429) {
                const retryAfter = response.headers.get("X-Retry-After");
                console.log(`Rate limit exceeded. Retry after ${retryAfter} seconds`);
            }
        },
    }
})
```

### Schema

If you are using a database to store rate limit data you need this schema:

Table Name: `rateLimit`

<DatabaseTable
    fields={[
        { 
        name: "id", 
        type: "string", 
        description: "Database ID",
        isPrimaryKey: true
        },
        {

title: Session Management
description: Better Auth session management.
---

Better Auth manages session using a traditional cookie-based session management. The session is stored in a cookie and is sent to the server on every request. The server then verifies the session and returns the user data if the session is valid.

## Session table

The session table stores the session data. The session table has the following fields:

- `id`: The session token. Which is also used as the session cookie.
- `userId`: The user ID of the user.
- `expiresAt`: The expiration date of the session.
- `ipAddress`: The IP address of the user.
- `userAgent`: The user agent of the user. It stores the user agent header from the request.

## Session Expiration

The session expires after 7 days by default. But whenever the session is used and the `updateAge` is reached, the session expiration is updated to the current time plus the `expiresIn` value.

You can change both the `expiresIn` and `updateAge` values by passing the `session` object to the `auth` configuration.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    //... other config options
    session: {
        expiresIn: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // 7 days
        updateAge: 60 * 60 * 24 // 1 day (every 1 day the session expiration is updated)
    }
})
```

### Disable Session Refresh

You can disable session refresh so that the session is not updated regardless of the `updateAge` option.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    //... other config options
    session: {
        disableSessionRefresh: true
    }
})
```

## Session Freshness

Some endpoints in Better Auth require the session to be **fresh**. A session is considered fresh if its `createdAt` is within the `freshAge` limit. By default, the `freshAge` is set to **1 day** (60 * 60 * 24).  

You can customize the `freshAge` value by passing a `session` object in the `auth` configuration:  

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    //... other config options
    session: {
        freshAge: 60 * 5 // 5 minutes (the session is fresh if created within the last 5 minutes)
    }
})
```

To **disable the freshness check**, set `freshAge` to `0`:  

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    //... other config options
    session: {
        freshAge: 0 // Disable freshness check
    }
})
```
## Session Management

Better Auth provides a set of functions to manage sessions.

### Get Session

The `getSession` function retrieves the current active session.

```ts client="client.ts"
import { authClient } from "@/lib/client"

const { data: session } = await authClient.getSession()
```

To learn how to customize the session response check the [Customizing Session Response](#customizing-session-response) section.

### Use Session

The `useSession` action provides a reactive way to access the current session.

```ts client="client.ts"
import { authClient } from "@/lib/client"

const { data: session } = authClient.useSession()
```

### List Sessions

The `listSessions` function returns a list of sessions that are active for the user.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { authClient } from "@/lib/client"

const sessions = await authClient.listSessions()
```

### Revoke Session

When a user signs out of a device, the session is automatically ended. However, you can also end a session manually from any device the user is signed into.

To end a session, use the `revokeSession` function. Just pass the session token as a parameter.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
await authClient.revokeSession({
    token: "session-token"
})
```

### Revoke Other Sessions

To revoke all other sessions except the current session, you can use the `revokeOtherSessions` function.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
await authClient.revokeOtherSessions()
```

### Revoke All Sessions

To revoke all sessions, you can use the `revokeSessions` function.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
await authClient.revokeSessions()
```

### Revoking Sessions on Password Change

You can revoke all sessions when the user changes their password by passing `revokeOtherSessions` as true on `changePassword` function.

```ts title="auth.ts"
await authClient.changePassword({
    newPassword: newPassword,
    currentPassword: currentPassword,
    revokeOtherSessions: true,
})
```

## Session Caching

### Cookie Cache

Calling your database every time `useSession` or `getSession` invoked isn’t ideal, especially if sessions don’t change frequently. Cookie caching handles this by storing session data in a short-lived, signed cookie—similar to how JWT access tokens are used with refresh tokens.

When cookie caching is enabled, the server can check session validity from the cookie itself instead of hitting the database each time. The cookie is signed to prevent tampering, and a short `maxAge` ensures that the session data gets refreshed regularly. If a session is revoked or expires, the cookie will be invalidated automatically.

To turn on cookie caching, just set `session.cookieCache` in your auth config:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    session: {
        cookieCache: {
            enabled: true,
            maxAge: 5 * 60 // Cache duration in seconds
        }
    }
});
```

If you want to disable returning from the cookie cache when fetching the session, you can pass `disableCookieCache:true` this will force the server to fetch the session from the database and also refresh the cookie cache.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const session = await authClient.getSession({ query: {
    disableCookieCache: true
}})
```

or on the server

```ts title="server.ts"
await auth.api.getSession({
    query: {
        disableCookieCache: true,
    }, 
    headers: req.headers, // pass the headers
});
```


## Customizing Session Response

When you call `getSession` or `useSession`, the session data is returned as a `user` and `session` object. You can customize this response using the `customSession` plugin.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { customSession } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        customSession(async ({ user, session }) => {
            const roles = findUserRoles(session.session.userId);
            return {
                roles,
                user: {
                    ...user,
                    newField: "newField",
                },
                session
            };
        }),
    ],
});
```

This will add `roles` and `user.newField` to the session response.

**Infer on the Client**

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { customSessionClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins";
import type { auth } from "@/lib/auth"; // Import the auth instance as a type

const authClient = createAuthClient({
    plugins: [customSessionClient<typeof auth>()],
});

const { data } = authClient.useSession();
const { data: sessionData } = await authClient.getSession();
// data.roles
// data.user.newField
```

### Caveats on Customizing Session Response

1. The passed `session` object to the callback does not infer fields added by plugins.  

However, as a workaround, you can pull up your auth options and pass it to the plugin to infer the fields.

```ts
import { betterAuth, BetterAuthOptions } from "better-auth";

const options = {
  //...config options
  plugins: [
    //...plugins 
  ]
} satisfies BetterAuthOptions;

export const auth = betterAuth({
    ...options,
    plugins: [
        ...(options.plugins ?? []),
        customSession(async ({ user, session }, ctx) => {
            // now both user and session will infer the fields added by plugins and your custom fields
            return {
                user,
                session
            }
        }, options), // pass options here  // [!code highlight]
    ]
})
```

2. When your server and client code are in separate projects or repositories, and you cannot import the `auth` instance as a type reference, type inference for custom session fields will not work on the client side.
3. Session caching, including secondary storage or cookie cache, does not include custom fields. Each time the session is fetched, your custom session function will be called.

title: TypeScript
description: Better Auth TypeScript integration.

Better Auth is designed to be type-safe. Both the client and server are built with TypeScript, allowing you to easily infer types.


## TypeScript Config

### Strict Mode

Better Auth is designed to work with TypeScript's strict mode. We recommend enabling strict mode in your TypeScript config file:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

if you can't set `strict` to `true`, you can enable `strictNullChecks`:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strictNullChecks": true,
  }
}
```

<Callout type="warn">
If you're running into issues with TypeScript inference exceeding maximum length the compiler will serialize,
then please make sure you're following the instructions above, as well as ensuring that both `declaration` and `composite` are not enabled.
</Callout>

## Inferring Types

Both the client SDK and the server offer types that can be inferred using the `$Infer` property. Plugins can extend base types like `User` and `Session`, and you can use `$Infer` to infer these types. Additionally, plugins can provide extra types that can also be inferred through `$Infer`.

```ts title="auth-client.ts" 
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"

const authClient = createAuthClient()

export type Session = typeof authClient.$Infer.Session
```

The `Session` type includes both `session` and `user` properties. The user property represents the user object type, and the `session` property represents the `session` object type.

You can also infer types on the server side.

```ts title="auth.ts" 
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import Database from "better-sqlite3"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    database: new Database("database.db")
})

type Session = typeof auth.$Infer.Session
```


## Additional Fields

Better Auth allows you to add additional fields to the user and session objects. All additional fields are properly inferred and available on the server and client side.

```ts 
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import Database from "better-sqlite3"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    database: new Database("database.db"),
    user: {
       additionalFields: {
          role: {
              type: "string",
              input: false
            } 
        }
    }
   
})

type Session = typeof auth.$Infer.Session
```

In the example above, we added a `role` field to the user object. This field is now available on the `Session` type.


### The `input` property

The `input` property in an additional field configuration determines whether the field should be included in the user input. This property defaults to `true`, meaning the field will be part of the user input during operations like registration.

To prevent a field from being part of the user input, you must explicitly set `input: false`:

```ts
additionalFields: {
    role: {
        type: "string",
        input: false
    }
}
```

When `input` is set to `false`, the field will be excluded from user input, preventing users from passing a value for it.

By default, additional fields are included in the user input, which can lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled carefully. For fields that should not be set by the user, like a `role`, it is crucial to set `input: false` in the configuration.

### Inferring Additional Fields on Client

To make sure proper type inference for additional fields on the client side, you need to inform the client about these fields. There are two approaches to achieve this, depending on your project structure:

1. For Monorepo or Single-Project Setups

If your server and client code reside in the same project, you can use the `inferAdditionalFields` plugin to automatically infer the additional fields from your server configuration.

```ts
import { inferAdditionalFields } from "better-auth/client/plugins";
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";
import type { auth } from "./auth";

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
  plugins: [inferAdditionalFields<typeof auth>()],
});
```

2. For Separate Client-Server Projects

If your client and server are in separate projects, you'll need to manually specify the additional fields when creating the auth client.

```ts
import type { auth } from "./auth";
import { inferAdditionalFields } from "better-auth/client/plugins";

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
  plugins: [inferAdditionalFields({
      user: {
        role: {
          type: "string"
        }
      }
  })],
});
```
</file>

<file path="docs/better-auth/concepts/users-accounts.mdx">

title: User & Accounts
description: User and account management.
---

Beyond authenticating users, Better Auth also provides a set of methods to manage users. This includes, updating user information, changing passwords, and more.

The user table stores the authentication data of the user [Click here to view the schema](/docs/concepts/database#user).

The user table can be extended using [additional fields](/docs/concepts/database#extending-core-schema) or by plugins to store additional data.

## Update User

### Update User Information

To update user information, you can use the `updateUser` function provided by the client. The `updateUser` function takes an object with the following properties:

```ts
await authClient.updateUser({
    image: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
    name: "John Doe",
})
```
### Change Email

To allow users to change their email, first enable the `changeEmail` feature, which is disabled by default. Set `changeEmail.enabled` to `true`:

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
    user: {
        changeEmail: {
            enabled: true,
        }
    }
})
```

For users with a verified email, provide the `sendChangeEmailVerification` function. This function triggers when a user changes their email, sending a verification email with a URL and token. If the current email isn't verified, the change happens immediately without verification.

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
    user: {
        changeEmail: {
            enabled: true,
            sendChangeEmailVerification: async ({ user, newEmail, url, token }, request) => {
                await sendEmail({
                    to: user.email, // verification email must be sent to the current user email to approve the change
                    subject: 'Approve email change',
                    text: `Click the link to approve the change: ${url}`
                })
            }
        }
    }
})
```

Once enabled, use the `changeEmail` function on the client to update a user’s email. The user must verify their current email before changing it.

```ts
await authClient.changeEmail({
    newEmail: "new-email@email.com",
    callbackURL: "/dashboard", //to redirect after verification
});
```

After verification, the new email is updated in the user table, and a confirmation is sent to the new address.

<Callout type="warn">
    If the current email is unverified, the new email is updated without the verification step.
</Callout>
 
### Change Password
A user's password isn't stored in the user table. Instead, it's stored in the account table. To change the password of a user, you can use one of the following approaches:


<APIMethod path="/change-password" method="POST" requireSession>
```ts
type changePassword = {
    /**
     * The new password to set 
     */
    newPassword: string = "newpassword1234"
    /**
     * The current user password 
     */
    currentPassword: string = "oldpassword1234"
    /**
     * When set to true, all other active sessions for this user will be invalidated
     */
    revokeOtherSessions?: boolean = true
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Set Password

If a user was registered using OAuth or other providers, they won't have a password or a credential account. In this case, you can use the `setPassword` action to set a password for the user. For security reasons, this function can only be called from the server. We recommend having users go through a 'forgot password' flow to set a password for their account.

```ts
await auth.api.setPassword({
    body: { newPassword: "password" },
    headers: // headers containing the user's session token
});
```

## Delete User

Better Auth provides a utility to hard delete a user from your database. It's disabled by default, but you can enable it easily by passing `enabled:true`

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
    //...other config
    user: {
        deleteUser: { // [!code highlight]
            enabled: true // [!code highlight]
        } // [!code highlight]
    }
})
```

Once enabled, you can call `authClient.deleteUser` to permanently delete user data from your database.

### Adding Verification Before Deletion

For added security, you’ll likely want to confirm the user’s intent before deleting their account. A common approach is to send a verification email. Better Auth provides a `sendDeleteAccountVerification` utility for this purpose. 
This is especially needed if you have OAuth setup and want them to be able to delete their account without forcing them to login again for a fresh session.

Here’s how you can set it up:

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
    user: {
        deleteUser: {
            enabled: true,
            sendDeleteAccountVerification: async (
                {
                    user,   // The user object
                    url, // The auto-generated URL for deletion
                    token  // The verification token  (can be used to generate custom URL)
                },
                request  // The original request object (optional)
            ) => {
                // Your email sending logic here
                // Example: sendEmail(data.user.email, "Verify Deletion", data.url);
            },
        },
    },
});
```

**How callback verification works:**

- **Callback URL**: The URL provided in `sendDeleteAccountVerification` is a pre-generated link that deletes the user data when accessed.

```ts title="delete-user.ts"
await authClient.deleteUser({
    callbackURL: "/goodbye" // you can provide a callback URL to redirect after deletion
});
```

- **Authentication Check**: The user must be signed in to the account they’re attempting to delete.
If they aren’t signed in, the deletion process will fail. 

If you have sent a custom URL, you can use the `deleteUser` method with the token to delete the user.

```ts title="delete-user.ts"
await authClient.deleteUser({
    token
});
```

### Authentication Requirements

To delete a user, the user must meet one of the following requirements:

1. A valid password

if the user has a password, they can delete their account by providing the password.

```ts title="delete-user.ts"
await authClient.deleteUser({
    password: "password"
});
```

2. Fresh session

The user must have a `fresh` session token, meaning the user must have signed in recently. This is checked if the password is not provided.

<Callout type="warn">
By default `session.freshAge` is set to `60 * 60 * 24` (1 day). You can change this value by passing the `session` object to the `auth` configuration. If it is set to `0`, the freshness check is disabled. It is recommended not to disable this check if you are not using email verification for deleting the account.
</Callout>

```ts title="delete-user.ts"
await authClient.deleteUser();
```

3. Enabled email verification (needed for OAuth users)

As OAuth users don't have a password, we need to send a verification email to confirm the user's intent to delete their account. If you have already added the `sendDeleteAccountVerification` callback, you can just call the `deleteUser` method without providing any other information.

```ts title="delete-user.ts"
await authClient.deleteUser();
```

4. If you have a custom delete account page and sent that url via the `sendDeleteAccountVerification` callback.
Then you need to call the `deleteUser` method with the token to complete the deletion.

```ts title="delete-user.ts"
await authClient.deleteUser({
    token
});
```

### Callbacks

**beforeDelete**: This callback is called before the user is deleted. You can use this callback to perform any cleanup or additional checks before deleting the user.

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    user: {
        deleteUser: {
            enabled: true,
            beforeDelete: async (user) => {
                // Perform any cleanup or additional checks here
            },
        },
    },
});
```
you can also throw `APIError` to interrupt the deletion process.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { APIError } from "better-auth/api";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    user: {
        deleteUser: {
            enabled: true,
            beforeDelete: async (user, request) => {
                if (user.email.includes("admin")) {
                    throw new APIError("BAD_REQUEST", {
                        message: "Admin accounts can't be deleted",
                    });
                }
            },
        },
    },
});
```

**afterDelete**: This callback is called after the user is deleted. You can use this callback to perform any cleanup or additional actions after the user is deleted.

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    user: {
        deleteUser: {
            enabled: true,
            afterDelete: async (user, request) => {
                // Perform any cleanup or additional actions here
            },
        },
    },
});
```

## Accounts

Better Auth supports multiple authentication methods. Each authentication method is called a provider. For example, email and password authentication is a provider, Google authentication is a provider, etc.

When a user signs in using a provider, an account is created for the user. The account stores the authentication data returned by the provider. This data includes the access token, refresh token, and other information returned by the provider.

The account table stores the authentication data of the user [Click here to view the schema](/docs/concepts/database#account)


### List User Accounts

To list user accounts you can use `client.user.listAccounts` method. Which will return all accounts associated with a user.

```ts
const accounts = await authClient.listAccounts();
```

### Token Encryption

Better Auth doesn’t encrypt tokens by default and that’s intentional. We want you to have full control over how encryption and decryption are handled, rather than baking in behavior that could be confusing or limiting. If you need to store encrypted tokens (like accessToken or refreshToken), you can use databaseHooks to encrypt them before they’re saved to your database.

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
    databaseHooks: {
        account: {
            create: {
                before(account, context) {
                    const withEncryptedTokens = { ...account };
                    if (account.accessToken) {
                        const encryptedAccessToken = encrypt(account.accessToken)  // [!code highlight]
                        withEncryptedTokens.accessToken = encryptedAccessToken;
                    }
                    if (account.refreshToken) {
                        const encryptedRefreshToken = encrypt(account.refreshToken); // [!code highlight]
                        withEncryptedTokens.refreshToken = encryptedRefreshToken;
                    }
                    return {
                        data: resultAccount
                    }
                },
            }
        }
    }
})
```

Then whenever you retrieve back the account make sure to decrypt the tokens before using them.

### Account Linking

Account linking enables users to associate multiple authentication methods with a single account. With Better Auth, users can connect additional social sign-ons or OAuth providers to their existing accounts if the provider confirms the user's email as verified.

If account linking is disabled, no accounts can be linked, regardless of the provider or email verification status.

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    account: {
        accountLinking: {
            enabled: true, 
        }
    },
});
```

#### Forced Linking

You can specify a list of "trusted providers." When a user logs in using a trusted provider, their account will be automatically linked even if the provider doesn’t confirm the email verification status. Use this with caution as it may increase the risk of account takeover.

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    account: {
        accountLinking: {
            enabled: true,
            trustedProviders: ["google", "github"]
        }
    },
});
```

#### Manually Linking Accounts

Users already signed in can manually link their account to additional social providers or credential-based accounts.

- **Linking Social Accounts:** Use the `linkSocial` method on the client to link a social provider to the user's account.

  ```ts
  await authClient.linkSocial({
      provider: "google", // Provider to link
      callbackURL: "/callback" // Callback URL after linking completes
  });
  ```

  You can also request specific scopes when linking a social account, which can be different from the scopes used during the initial authentication:

  ```ts
  await authClient.linkSocial({
      provider: "google",
      callbackURL: "/callback",
      scopes: ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly"] // Request additional scopes
  });
  ```

  You can also link accounts using ID tokens directly, without redirecting to the provider's OAuth flow:

  ```ts
  await authClient.linkSocial({
      provider: "google",
      idToken: {
          token: "id_token_from_provider",
          nonce: "nonce_used_for_token", // Optional
          accessToken: "access_token", // Optional, may be required by some providers
          refreshToken: "refresh_token" // Optional
      }
  });
  ```

  This is useful when you already have valid tokens from the provider, for example:
  - After signing in with a native SDK
  - When using a mobile app that handles authentication
  - When implementing custom OAuth flows

  The ID token must be valid and the provider must support ID token verification.

  If you want your users to be able to link a social account with a different email address than the user, or if you want to use a provider that does not return email addresses, you will need to enable this in the account linking settings. 
  ```ts title="auth.ts"
  export const auth = betterAuth({
      account: {
          accountLinking: {
              allowDifferentEmails: true
          }
      },
  });
  ```

  If you want the newly linked accounts to update the user information, you need to enable this in the account linking settings. 

  ```ts title="auth.ts"
  export const auth = betterAuth({
      account: {
          accountLinking: {
              updateUserInfoOnLink: true
          }
      },
  });
  ```

- **Linking Credential-Based Accounts:** To link a credential-based account (e.g., email and password), users can initiate a "forgot password" flow, or you can call the `setPassword` method on the server. 

  ```ts
  await auth.api.setPassword({
      headers: /* headers containing the user's session token */,
      password: /* new password */
  });
  ```

<Callout>
`setPassword` can't be called from the client for security reasons.
</Callout>

### Account Unlinking

You can unlink a user account by providing a `providerId`.

```ts
await authClient.unlinkAccount({
    providerId: "google"
});

// Unlink a specific account
await authClient.unlinkAccount({
    providerId: "google",
    accountId: "123"
});
```

If the account doesn't exist, it will throw an error. Additionally, if the user only has one account, the unlinking process will fail to prevent account lockout unless `allowUnlinkingAll` is set to `true`.

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    account: {
        accountLinking: {
            allowUnlinkingAll: true
        }
    },
});
```

title: Browser Extension Guide
description: A step-by-step guide to creating a browser extension with Better Auth.
---

In this guide, we'll walk you through the steps of creating a browser extension using <Link href="https://docs.plasmo.com/">Plasmo</Link> with Better Auth for authentication.

If you would like to view a completed example, you can check out the <Link href="https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/tree/main/examples/browser-extension-example">browser extension example</Link>.

<Callout type="warn">
  The Plasmo framework does not provide a backend for the browser extension.
  This guide assumes you have{" "}
  <Link href="/docs/integrations/hono">a backend setup</Link> of Better Auth and
  are ready to create a browser extension to connect to it.
</Callout>

<Steps>

    <Step>
        ## Setup & Installations

        Initialize a new Plasmo project with TailwindCSS and a src directory.

        ```bash
        pnpm create plasmo --with-tailwindcss --with-src
        ```

        Then, install the Better Auth package.

        ```bash
        pnpm add better-auth
        ```

        To start the Plasmo development server, run the following command.

        ```bash
        pnpm dev
        ```
    </Step>


    <Step>
        ## Configure tsconfig

        Configure the `tsconfig.json` file to include `strict` mode.

        For this demo, we have also changed the import alias from `~` to `@` and set it to the `src` directory.

        ```json title="tsconfig.json"
        {
            "compilerOptions": {
                "paths": {
                    "@/_": [
                        "./src/_"
                    ]
                },
                "strict": true,
                "baseUrl": "."
            }
        }
        ```
    </Step>


    <Step>
        ## Create the client auth instance

        Create a new file at `src/auth/auth-client.ts` and add the following code.

       <Files>
            <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
                <Folder name="auth" defaultOpen>
                    <File name="auth-client.ts" />
                </Folder>
            </Folder>
       </Files>

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react"

        export const authClient = createAuthClient({
            baseURL: "http://localhost:3000" /* Base URL of your Better Auth backend. */,
            plugins: [],
        });
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ## Configure the manifest

        We must ensure the extension knows the URL to the Better Auth backend.

        Head to your package.json file, and add the following code.

        ```json title="package.json"
        {
            //...
            "manifest": {
                "host_permissions": [
                    "https://URL_TO_YOUR_BACKEND" // localhost works too (e.g. http://localhost:3000)
                ]
            }
        }
        ```
    </Step>


    <Step>
        ## You're now ready!

        You have now set up Better Auth for your browser extension.

        Add your desired UI and create your dream extension!

        To learn more about the client Better Auth API, check out the <Link href="/docs/concepts/client">client documentation</Link>.


        Here's a quick example 😎

        ```tsx title="src/popup.tsx"
        import { authClient } from "./auth/auth-client"


        function IndexPopup() {
            const {data, isPending, error} = authClient.useSession();
            if(isPending){
                return <>Loading...</>
            }
            if(error){
                return <>Error: {error.message}</>
            }
            if(data){
                return <>Signed in as {data.user.name}</>
            }
        }

        export default IndexPopup;
        ```

    </Step>


    <Step>
        ## Bundle your extension

        To get a production build, run the following command.

        ```bash
        pnpm build
        ```

        Head over to <Link href="chrome://extensions" target="_blank">chrome://extensions</Link> and enable developer mode.

        <img src="https://docs.plasmo.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fdeveloper_mode.76f090f7.png&w=1920&q=75" />

        Click on "Load Unpacked" and navigate to your extension's `build/chrome-mv3-dev` (or `build/chrome-mv3-prod`) directory.

        To see your popup, click on the puzzle piece icon on the Chrome toolbar, and click on your extension.

        Learn more about <Link href="https://docs.plasmo.com/framework#loading-the-extension-in-chrome">bundling your extension here.</Link>
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ## Configure the server auth instance

        First, we will need your extension URL.
        
        An extension URL formed like this: `chrome-extension://YOUR_EXTENSION_ID`.

        You can find your extension ID at <Link href="chrome://extensions" target="_blank">chrome://extensions</Link>.

        <img src="/extension-id.png" width={500} />

        Head to your server's auth file, and make sure that your extension's URL is added to the `trustedOrigins` list.


        ```ts title="server.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { auth } from "@/auth/auth"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            trustedOrigins: ["chrome-extension://YOUR_EXTENSION_ID"],
        })
        ```

        If you're developing multiple extensions or need to support different browser extensions with different IDs, you can use wildcard patterns:

        ```ts title="server.ts"
        export const auth = betterAuth({
            trustedOrigins: [
                // Support a specific extension ID
                "chrome-extension://YOUR_EXTENSION_ID",
                
                // Or support multiple extensions with wildcard (less secure)
                "chrome-extension://*"
            ],
        })
        ```

        <Callout type="warn">
          Using wildcards for extension origins (`chrome-extension://*`) reduces security by trusting all extensions. 
          It's safer to explicitly list each extension ID you trust. Only use wildcards for development and testing.
        </Callout>
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ## That's it!

        Everything is set up! You can now start developing your extension. 🎉
    </Step>

</Steps>

title: Migrating from Clerk to Better Auth
description: A step-by-step guide to transitioning from Clerk to Better Auth.
---

In this guide, we'll walk through the steps to migrate a project from Clerk to Better Auth — including email/password with proper hashing, social/external accounts, phone number, two-factor data, and more.

<Callout type="warn">
This migration will invalidate all active sessions. This guide doesn't currently show you how to migrate Organization but it should be possible with additional steps and the [Organization](/docs/plugins/organization) Plugin.
</Callout>

## Before You Begin

Before starting the migration process, set up Better Auth in your project. Follow the [installation guide](/docs/installation) to get started. And go to 

<Steps>
<Step>
### Connect to your database

You'll need to connect to your database to migrate the users and accounts. You can use any database you want, but for this example, we'll use PostgreSQL.

```package-install
npm install pg
```

And then you can use the following code to connect to your database.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { Pool } from "pg";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    database: new Pool({ 
        connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL 
    }),
})
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Enable Email and Password (Optional)

Enable the email and password in your auth config and implement your own logic for sending verification emails, reset password emails, etc.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    database: new Pool({ 
        connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL 
    }),
    emailAndPassword: { // [!code highlight]
        enabled: true, // [!code highlight]
    }, // [!code highlight]
    emailVerification: {
      sendVerificationEmail: async({ user, url })=>{
        // implement your logic here to send email verification
      }
	},
})
```

See [Email and Password](/docs/authentication/email-password) for more configuration options.
</Step>
<Step>
### Setup Social Providers (Optional)

Add social providers you have enabled in your Clerk project in your auth config.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    database: new Pool({ 
        connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL 
    }),
    emailAndPassword: { 
        enabled: true,
    },
    socialProviders: { // [!code highlight]
        github: { // [!code highlight]
            clientId: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID, // [!code highlight]
            clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET, // [!code highlight]
        } // [!code highlight]
    } // [!code highlight]
})
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Add Plugins (Optional)

You can add the following plugins to your auth config based on your needs.

[Admin](/docs/plugins/admin) Plugin will allow you to manage users, user impersonations and app level roles and permissions.

[Two Factor](/docs/plugins/2fa) Plugin will allow you to add two-factor authentication to your application.

[Phone Number](/docs/plugins/phone-number) Plugin will allow you to add phone number authentication to your application.

[Username](/docs/plugins/username) Plugin will allow you to add username authentication to your application.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { Pool } from "pg";
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { admin, twoFactor, phoneNumber, username } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    database: new Pool({ 
        connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL 
    }),
    emailAndPassword: { 
        enabled: true,
    },
    socialProviders: {
        github: {
            clientId: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID!,
            clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET!,
        }
    },
    plugins: [admin(), twoFactor(), phoneNumber(), username()], // [!code highlight]
})
```
</Step>
  <Step>
  ### Generate Schema

  If you're using a custom database adapter, generate the schema:

  ```sh
  npx @better-auth/cli generate
  ```

  or if you're using the default adapter, you can use the following command:

  ```sh
  npx @better-auth/cli migrate
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ### Export Clerk Users
  Go to the Clerk dashboard and export the users. Check how to do it [here](https://clerk.com/docs/deployments/exporting-users#export-your-users-data-from-the-clerk-dashboard). It will download a CSV file with the users data. You need to save it as `exported_users.csv` and put it in the root of your project.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ### Create the migration script

  Make sure to replace the `process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY` with your own Clerk secret key. Feel free to customize the script to your needs.
 </Step>
  
<Step>
  ### Run the migration

  Run the migration:

  ```sh
  bun run script/migrate-clerk.ts # you can use any thing you like to run the script
  ```

  <Callout type="warning">
  Make sure to:
  1. Test the migration in a development environment first
  2. Monitor the migration process for any errors
  3. Verify the migrated data in Better Auth before proceeding
  4. Keep Clerk installed and configured until the migration is complete
  </Callout>

  </Step>
  <Step>
  ### Verify the migration

  After running the migration, verify that all users have been properly migrated by checking the database.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ### Update your components

  Now that the data is migrated, you can start updating your components to use Better Auth. Here's an example for the sign-in component:

  ```tsx title="components/auth/sign-in.tsx"
  import { authClient } from "better-auth/client";

  export const SignIn = () => {
    const handleSignIn = async () => {
      const { data, error } = await authClient.signIn.email({
        email: "user@example.com",
        password: "password",
      });
      
      if (error) {
        console.error(error);
        return;
      }
      // Handle successful sign in
    };

    return (
      <form onSubmit={handleSignIn}>
        <button type="submit">Sign in</button>
      </form>
    );
  };
  ```
  </Step>
<Step>
  ### Update the middleware

  Replace your Clerk middleware with Better Auth's middleware:

  ```ts title="middleware.ts"

  import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
  import { getSessionCookie } from "better-auth/cookies";
  export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
    const sessionCookie = getSessionCookie(request);
    const { pathname } = request.nextUrl;
    if (sessionCookie && ["/login", "/signup"].includes(pathname)) {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/dashboard", request.url));
    }
    if (!sessionCookie && pathname.startsWith("/dashboard")) {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/login", request.url));
    }
    return NextResponse.next();
  }

  export const config = {
    matcher: ["/dashboard", "/login", "/signup"],
  };
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ### Remove Clerk Dependencies

  Once you've verified that everything is working correctly with Better Auth, you can remove Clerk:

  ```bash title="Remove Clerk"
  pnpm remove @clerk/nextjs @clerk/themes @clerk/types
  ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

title: Create a Database Adapter
description: Learn how to create a custom database adapter for Better-Auth
---

Learn how to create a custom database adapter for Better-Auth using `createAdapter`.

Our `createAdapter` function is designed to be very flexible, and we've done our best to make it easy to understand and use.
Our hope is to allow you to focus on writing database logic, and not have to worry about how the adapter is working with Better-Auth.

Anything from custom schema configurations, custom ID generation, safe JSON parsing, and more is handled by the `createAdapter` function.
All you need to do is provide the database logic, and the `createAdapter` function will handle the rest.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
<Step>
### Get things ready

1. Import `createAdapter`.
2. Create `CustomAdapterConfig` interface that represents your adapter config options.
3. Create the adapter!

```ts
import { createAdapter, type AdapterDebugLogs } from "better-auth/adapters";

// Your custom adapter config options
interface CustomAdapterConfig {
  /**
   * Helps you debug issues with the adapter.
   */
  debugLogs?: AdapterDebugLogs;
  /**
   * If the table names in the schema are plural.
   */
  usePlural?: boolean;
}

export const myAdapter = (config: CustomAdapterConfig = {}) =>
  createAdapter({
    // ...
  });
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure the adapter

The `config` object is mostly used to provide information about the adapter to Better-Auth.
We try to minimize the amount of code you need to write in your adapter functions, and these `config` options are used to help us do that.

```ts
// ...
export const myAdapter = (config: CustomAdapterConfig = {}) =>
  createAdapter({
    config: {
      adapterId: "custom-adapter", // A unique identifier for the adapter.
      adapterName: "Custom Adapter", // The name of the adapter.
      usePlural: config.usePlural ?? false, // Whether the table names in the schema are plural.
      debugLogs: config.debugLogs ?? false, // Whether to enable debug logs.
      supportsJSON: false, // Whether the database supports JSON. (Default: false)
      supportsDates: true, // Whether the database supports dates. (Default: true)
      supportsBooleans: true, // Whether the database supports booleans. (Default: true)
      supportsNumericIds: true, // Whether the database supports auto-incrementing numeric IDs. (Default: true)
    },
    // ...
  });
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Create the adapter

The `adapter` function is where you write the code that interacts with your database.

```ts
// ...
export const myAdapter = (config: CustomAdapterConfig = {}) =>
  createAdapter({
    config: {
      // ...
    },
    adapter: ({}) => {
      return {
        create: async ({ data, model, select }) => {
          // ...
        },
        update: async ({ data, model, select }) => {
          // ...
        },
        updateMany: async ({ data, model, select }) => {
          // ...
        },
        delete: async ({ data, model, select }) => {
          // ...
        },
        // ...
      };
    },
  });
```

</Callout>
</Step>

</Steps>

## Adapter

The `adapter` function is where you write the code that interacts with your database.

If you haven't already, check out the `options` object in the [config section](#config), as it can be useful for your adapter.

Before we get into the adapter function, let's go over the parameters that are available to you.

- `options`: The Better Auth options.
- `schema`: The schema from the user's Better Auth instance.
- `debugLog`: The debug log function.
- `getField`: The get field function.
- `getDefaultModelName`: The get default model name function.
- `getDefaultFieldName`: The get default field name function.
- `getFieldAttributes`: The get field attributes function.

```ts title="Example"
adapter: ({
  options,
  schema,
  debugLog,
  getField,
  getDefaultModelName,
  getDefaultFieldName,
}) => {
  return {
    // ...
  };
};
```

### Adapter Methods

- All `model` values are already transformed into the correct model name for the database based on the end-user's schema configuration.
  - This also means that if you need access to the `schema` version of a given model, you can't use this exact `model` value, you'll need to use the `getDefaultModelName` function provided in the options to convert the `model` to the `schema` version.
- We will automatically fill in any missing fields you return based on the user's `schema` configuration.
- Any method that includes a `select` parameter, is only for the purpose of getting data from your database more efficiently. You do not need to worry about only returning what the `select` parameter states, as we will handle that for you.

### `create` method

The `create` method is used to create a new record in the database.

<Callout>
Note:
If the user has enabled the `useNumberId` option, or if `generateId` is `false` in the user's Better Auth config,
then it's expected that the `id` is provided in the `data` object. Otherwise, the `id` will be automatically generated.

Additionally, it's possible to pass `forceAllowId` as a parameter to the `create` method, which allows `id` to be provided in the `data` object.
We handle `forceAllowId` internally, so you don't need to worry about it.
</Callout>

parameters:

- `model`: The model/table name that new data will be inserted into.
- `data`: The data to insert into the database.
- `select`: An array of fields to return from the database.

<Callout>
  Make sure to return the data that is inserted into the database.
</Callout>

```ts title="Example"
create: async ({ model, data, select }) => {
  // Example of inserting data into the database.
  return await db.insert(model).values(data);
};
```

### `update` method

The `update` method is used to update a record in the database.

parameters:

- `model`: The model/table name that the record will be updated in.
- `where`: The `where` clause to update the record by.
- `update`: The data to update the record with.

<Callout>
  Make sure to return the data in the row which is updated. This includes any
  fields that were not updated.
</Callout>

```ts title="Example"
update: async ({ model, where, update }) => {
  // Example of updating data in the database.
  return await db.update(model).set(update).where(where);
};
```

### `updateMany` method

The `updateMany` method is used to update multiple records in the database.

parameters:

- `model`: The model/table name that the records will be updated in.
- `where`: The `where` clause to update the records by.
- `update`: The data to update the records with.

<Callout>Make sure to return the number of records that were updated.</Callout>

```ts title="Example"
updateMany: async ({ model, where, update }) => {
  // Example of updating multiple records in the database.
  return await db.update(model).set(update).where(where);
};
```

### `delete` method

The `delete` method is used to delete a record from the database.

parameters:

- `model`: The model/table name that the record will be deleted from.
- `where`: The `where` clause to delete the record by.

```ts title="Example"
delete: async ({ model, where }) => {
  // Example of deleting a record from the database.
  await db.delete(model).where(where);
}
```

### `deleteMany` method

The `deleteMany` method is used to delete multiple records from the database.

parameters:

- `model`: The model/table name that the records will be deleted from.
- `where`: The `where` clause to delete the records by.

<Callout>Make sure to return the number of records that were deleted.</Callout>

```ts title="Example"
deleteMany: async ({ model, where }) => {
  // Example of deleting multiple records from the database.
  return await db.delete(model).where(where);
};
```

### `findOne` method

The `findOne` method is used to find a single record in the database.

parameters:

- `model`: The model/table name that the record will be found in.
- `where`: The `where` clause to find the record by.
- `select`: The `select` clause to return.

<Callout>Make sure to return the data that is found in the database.</Callout>

```ts title="Example"
findOne: async ({ model, where, select }) => {
  // Example of finding a single record in the database.
  return await db.select().from(model).where(where).limit(1);
};
```

### `findMany` method

The `findMany` method is used to find multiple records in the database.

parameters:

- `model`: The model/table name that the records will be found in.
- `where`: The `where` clause to find the records by.
- `limit`: The limit of records to return.
- `sortBy`: The `sortBy` clause to sort the records by.
- `offset`: The offset of records to return.

<Callout>
  Make sure to return the array of data that is found in the database.
</Callout>

  // Example of finding multiple records in the database.
  return await db
    .select()
    .from(model)
    .where(where)
    .limit(limit)
    .offset(offset)
    .orderBy(sortBy);
};
```

### `count` method

The `count` method is used to count the number of records in the database.

parameters:

- `model`: The model/table name that the records will be counted in.
- `where`: The `where` clause to count the records by.

<Callout>Make sure to return the number of records that were counted.</Callout>

```ts title="Example"
count: async ({ model, where }) => {
  // Example of counting the number of records in the database.
  return await db.select().from(model).where(where).count();
};
```

### `options` (optional)

The `options` object is for any potential config that you got from your custom adapter options.

```ts title="Example"
const myAdapter = (config: CustomAdapterConfig) =>
  createAdapter({
    config: {
      // ...
    },
    adapter: ({ options }) => {
      return {
        options: config,
      };
    },
  });
```

### `createSchema` (optional)

The `createSchema` method allows the [Better Auth CLI](/docs/concepts/cli) to [generate](/docs/concepts/cli/#generate) a schema for the database.

parameters:

- `tables`: The tables from the user's Better-Auth instance schema; which is expected to be generated into the schema file.
- `file`: The file the user may have passed in to the `generate` command as the expected schema file output path.

```ts title="Example"
createSchema: async ({ file, tables }) => {
  // ... Custom logic to create a schema for the database.
};
```

## Test your adapter

We've provided a test suite that you can use to test your adapter. It requires you to use `vitest`.

```ts title="my-adapter.test.ts"
import { expect, test, describe } from "vitest";
import { runAdapterTest } from "better-auth/adapters/test";
import { myAdapter } from "./my-adapter";

describe("My Adapter Tests", async () => {
  afterAll(async () => {
    // Run DB cleanup here...
  });
  const adapter = myAdapter({
    debugLogs: {
      // If your adapter config allows passing in debug logs, then pass this here.
      isRunningAdapterTests: true, // This is our super secret flag to let us know to only log debug logs if a test fails.
    },
  });

  await runAdapterTest({
    getAdapter: async (betterAuthOptions = {}) => {
      return adapter(betterAuthOptions);
    },
  });
});
```

### Numeric ID tests

If your database supports numeric IDs, then you should run this test as well:

```ts title="my-adapter.number-id.test.ts"
import { expect, test, describe } from "vitest";
import { runNumberIdAdapterTest } from "better-auth/adapters/test";
import { myAdapter } from "./my-adapter";

describe("My Adapter Numeric ID Tests", async () => {
  afterAll(async () => {
    // Run DB cleanup here...
  });
  const adapter = myAdapter({
    debugLogs: {
      // If your adapter config allows passing in debug logs, then pass this here.
      isRunningAdapterTests: true, // This is our super secret flag to let us know to only log debug logs if a test fails.
    },
  });

  await runNumberIdAdapterTest({
    getAdapter: async (betterAuthOptions = {}) => {
      return adapter(betterAuthOptions);
    },
  });
});
```

## Config

The `config` object is used to provide information about the adapter to Better-Auth.

We **highly recommend** going through and reading each provided option below, as it will help you understand how to properly configure your adapter.

### Required Config

### `adapterId`

A unique identifier for the adapter.

### `adapterName`

The name of the adapter.

### Optional Config

### `supportsNumericIds`

Whether the database supports numeric IDs. If this is set to `false` and the user's config has enabled `useNumberId`, then we will throw an error.

### `supportsJSON`

Whether the database supports JSON. If the database doesn't support JSON, we will use a `string` to save the JSON data.And when we retrieve the data, we will safely parse the `string` back into a JSON object.

### `supportsDates`

Whether the database supports dates. If the database doesn't support dates, we will use a `string` to save the date. (ISO string) When we retrieve the data, we will safely parse the `string` back into a `Date` object.

### `supportsBooleans`

Whether the database supports booleans. If the database doesn't support booleans, we will use a `0` or `1` to save the boolean value. When we retrieve the data, we will safely parse the `0` or `1` back into a boolean value.

### `usePlural`

Whether the table names in the schema are plural. This is often defined by the user, and passed down through your custom adapter options. If you do not intend to allow the user to customize the table names, you can ignore this option, or set this to `false`.

```ts title="Example"
const adapter = myAdapter({
  // This value then gets passed into the `usePlural`
  // option in the createAdapter `config` object.
  usePlural: true,
});
```

### `debugLogs`

Used to enable debug logs for the adapter. You can pass in a boolean, or an object with the following keys: `create`, `update`, `updateMany`, `findOne`, `findMany`, `delete`, `deleteMany`, `count`.
If any of the keys are `true`, the debug logs will be enabled for that method.

```ts title="Example"
// Will log debug logs for all methods.
const adapter = myAdapter({
  debugLogs: true,
});
```

```ts title="Example"
// Will only log debug logs for the `create` and `update` methods.
const adapter = myAdapter({
  debugLogs: {
    create: true,
    update: true,
  },
});
```

### `disableIdGeneration`

Whether to disable ID generation. If this is set to `true`, then the user's `generateId` option will be ignored.

### `customIdGenerator`

If your database only supports a specific custom ID generation, then you can use this option to generate your own IDs.

### `mapKeysTransformInput`

If your database uses a different key name for a given situation, you can use this option to map the keys. This is useful for databases that expect a different key name for a given situation.
For example, MongoDB uses `_id` while in Better-Auth we use `id`.

Each key in the returned object represents the old key to replace.
The value represents the new key.

This can be a partial object that only transforms some keys.

```ts title="Example"
mapKeysTransformInput: () => {
  return {
    id: "_id", // We want to replace `id` to `_id` to save into MongoDB
  };
},
```

### `mapKeysTransformOutput`

If your database uses a different key name for a given situation, you can use this option to map the keys. This is useful for databases that use a different key name for a given situation.
For example, MongoDB uses `_id` while in Better-Auth we use `id`.

Each key in the returned object represents the old key to replace.
The value represents the new key.

This can be a partial object that only transforms some keys.

```ts title="Example"
mapKeysTransformOutput: () => {
  return {
    _id: "id", // We want to replace `_id` (from MongoDB) to `id` (for Better-Auth)
  };
},
```

### `customTransformInput`

If you need to transform the input data before it is saved to the database, you can use this option to transform the data.

<Callout type="warn">
  If you're using `supportsJSON`, `supportsDates`, or `supportsBooleans`, then
  the transformations will be applied before your `customTransformInput`
  function is called.
</Callout>
The `customTransformInput` function receives the following arguments:

- `data`: The data to transform.
- `field`: The field that is being transformed.
- `fieldAttributes`: The field attributes of the field that is being transformed.
- `select`: The `select` values which the query expects to return.
- `model`: The model that is being transformed.
- `schema`: The schema that is being transformed.
- `options`: Better Auth options.

The `customTransformInput` function runs at every key in the data object of a given action.

```ts title="Example"
customTransformInput: ({ field, data }) => {
  if (field === "id") {
    return "123"; // Force the ID to be "123"
  }

  return data;
};
```

### `customTransformOutput`

If you need to transform the output data before it is returned to the user, you can use this option to transform the data. The `customTransformOutput` function is used to transform the output data.
Similar to the `customTransformInput` function, it runs at every key in the data object of a given action, but it runs after the data is retrieved from the database.

```ts title="Example"
customTransformOutput: ({ field, data }) => {
  if (field === "name") {
    return "Bob"; // Force the name to be "Bob"
  }

  return data;
};
```

```ts
const some_data = await adapter.create({
  model: "user",
  data: {
    name: "John",
  },
});

// The name will be "Bob"
console.log(some_data.name);
```
</file>

title: Migrating from NextAuth.js to Better Auth
description: A step-by-step guide to transitioning from NextAuth.js to Better Auth.
---

In this guide, we’ll walk through the steps to migrate a project from [NextAuth.js](https://authjs.dev/) to Better Auth, ensuring no loss of data or functionality. While this guide focuses on Next.js, it can be adapted for other frameworks as well.

---

## Before You Begin

Before starting the migration process, set up Better Auth in your project. Follow the [installation guide](/docs/installation) to get started.

---

<Steps>
<Step>
### Mapping Existing Columns

Instead of altering your existing database column names, you can map them to match Better Auth's expected structure. This allows you to retain your current database schema.

#### User Schema

Map the following fields in the user schema:

- (next-auth v4) `emailVerified`: datetime → boolean

#### Session Schema

Map the following fields in the session schema:

- `expires` → `expiresAt`
- `sessionToken` → `token`
- (next-auth v4) add `createdAt` with datetime type
- (next-auth v4) add `updatedAt` with datetime type

```typescript title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    // Other configs
    session: {
        fields: {
            expiresAt: "expires", // Map your existing `expires` field to Better Auth's `expiresAt`
            token: "sessionToken" // Map your existing `sessionToken` field to Better Auth's `token`
        }
    },
});
```

Make sure to have `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields on your session schema.

#### Account Schema

Map these fields in the account schema:

- (next-auth v4) `provider` → `providerId`
- `providerAccountId` → `accountId`
- `refresh_token` → `refreshToken`
- `access_token` → `accessToken`
- (next-auth v3) `access_token_expires` → `accessTokenExpiresAt` and int → datetime
- (next-auth v4) `expires_at` → `accessTokenExpiresAt` and int → datetime
- `id_token` → `idToken`
- (next-auth v4) add `createdAt` with datetime type
- (next-auth v4) add `updatedAt` with datetime type

Remove the `session_state`, `type`, and `token_type` fields, as they are not required by Better Auth.

```typescript title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    // Other configs
    account: {
        fields: {
            accountId: "providerAccountId",
            refreshToken: "refresh_token",
            accessToken: "access_token",
            accessTokenExpiresAt: "access_token_expires",
            idToken: "id_token",
        }
    },
});
```

**Note:** If you use ORM adapters, you can map these fields in your schema file.

**Example with Prisma:**

```prisma title="schema.prisma"
model Session {
    id          String   @id @default(cuid())
    expiresAt   DateTime @map("expires") // Map your existing `expires` field to Better Auth's `expiresAt`
    token       String   @map("sessionToken") // Map your existing `sessionToken` field to Better Auth's `token`
    userId      String
    user        User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
```

Make sure to have `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields on your account schema.
</Step>
<Step>

### Update the Route Handler

In the `app/api/auth` folder, rename the `[...nextauth]` file to `[...all]` to avoid confusion. Then, update the `route.ts` file as follows:

```typescript title="app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts"
import { toNextJsHandler } from "better-auth/next-js";
import { auth } from "~/server/auth";

export const { POST, GET } = toNextJsHandler(auth);
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Update the Client

Create a file named `auth-client.ts` in the `lib` folder. Add the following code:

```typescript title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
    baseURL: process.env.BASE_URL! // Optional if the API base URL matches the frontend
});

export const { signIn, signOut, useSession } = authClient;
```

#### Social Login Functions

Update your social login functions to use Better Auth. For example, for Discord:

```typescript
import { signIn } from "~/lib/auth-client";

export const signInDiscord = async () => {
    const data = await signIn.social({
        provider: "discord"
    });
    return data;
};
```

#### Update `useSession` Calls

Replace `useSession` calls with Better Auth’s version. Example:

```typescript title="Profile.tsx"
import { useSession } from "~/lib/auth-client";

export const Profile = () => {
    const { data } = useSession();
    return (
        <div>
            <pre>
                {JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}
            </pre>
        </div>
    );
};
```
</Step>

<Step>

### Server-Side Session Handling

Use the `auth` instance to get session data on the server:

```typescript title="actions.ts"
"use server";

import { auth } from "~/server/auth";
import { headers } from "next/headers";

export const protectedAction = async () => {
    const session = await auth.api.getSession({
        headers: await headers(),
    });
};
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Middleware

To protect routes with middleware, refer to the [Next.js middleware guide](/docs/integrations/next#middleware).
</Step>
</Steps>


## Wrapping Up

Congratulations! You’ve successfully migrated from NextAuth.js to Better Auth. For a complete implementation with multiple authentication methods, check out the [demo repository](https://github.com/Bekacru/t3-app-better-auth).

Better Auth offers greater flexibility and more features—be sure to explore the [documentation](/docs) to unlock its full potential.

title: Optimizing for Performance
description: A guide to optimizing your Better Auth application for performance.
---

In this guide, we’ll go over some of the ways you can optimize your application for a more performant Better Auth app.

## Caching

Caching is a powerful technique that can significantly improve the performance of your Better Auth application by reducing the number of database queries and speeding up response times.

### Cookie Cache

Calling your database every time `useSession` or `getSession` invoked isn’t ideal, especially if sessions don’t change frequently. Cookie caching handles this by storing session data in a short-lived, signed cookie similar to how JWT access tokens are used with refresh tokens.

To turn on cookie caching, just set `session.cookieCache` in your auth config:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  session: {
    cookieCache: {
      enabled: true,
      maxAge: 5 * 60, // Cache duration in seconds
    },
  },
});
```

Read more about [cookie caching](/docs/concepts/session-management#cookie-cache).

### Framework Caching

Here are examples of how you can do caching in different frameworks and environments:

<Tabs items={["Next", "Remix", "SolidStart", "React Query"]}>
  <Tab value="Next">
    Since Next v15, we can use the `"use cache"` directive to cache the response of a server function.

    ```ts
    export async function getUsers() {
        'use cache' // [!code highlight]
        const { users } = await auth.api.listUsers();
        return users
    }
    ```

    Learn more about NextJS use cache directive <Link href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-cache">here</Link>.

  </Tab>
    <Tab value="Remix">
    In Remix, you can use the `cache` option in the `loader` function to cache responses on the server. Here’s an example:

    ```ts
    import { json } from '@remix-run/node';

    export const loader = async () => {
    const { users } = await auth.api.listUsers();
    return json(users, {
        headers: {
        'Cache-Control': 'max-age=3600', // Cache for 1 hour
        },
    });
    };
    ```


    You can read a nice guide on Loader vs Route Cache Headers in Remix <Link href="https://sergiodxa.com/articles/loader-vs-route-cache-headers-in-remix">here</Link>.

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SolidStart">
    In SolidStart, you can use the `query` function to cache data. Here’s an example:

    ```tsx
    const getUsers = query(
        async () => (await auth.api.listUsers()).users,
        "getUsers"
    );
    ```

    Learn more about SolidStart `query` function <Link href="https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-router/reference/data-apis/query">here</Link>.

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="React Query">
    With React Query you can use the `useQuery` hook to cache data. Here’s an example:

    ```ts
    import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';

    const fetchUsers = async () => {
        const { users } = await auth.api.listUsers();
        return users;
    };

    export default function Users() {
        const { data: users, isLoading } = useQuery('users', fetchUsers, {
            staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 15, // Cache for 15 minutes
        });

        if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

        return (
            <ul>
                {users.map(user => (
                    <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        );
    }
    ```

    Learn more about React Query use cache directive <Link href="https://react-query.tanstack.com/reference/useQuery#usecache">here</Link>.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## SSR Optimizations

If you're using a framework that supports server-side rendering, it's usually best to pre-fetch user session on the server and use it as a fallback on the client.

```ts
const session = await auth.api.getSession({
  headers: await headers(),
});
//then pass the session to the client
```

## Database optimizations

Optimizing database performance is essential to get the best out of Better Auth.

#### Recommended fields to index

| Table         | Fields                     | Plugin       |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------ |
| users         | `email`                    |              |
| accounts      | `userId`                   |              |
| sessions      | `userId`, `token`          |              |
| verifications | `identifier`               |              |
| invitations   | `email`, `organizationId`  | organization |
| members       | `userId`, `organizationId` | organization |
| organizations | `slug`                     | organization |
| passkey       | `userId`                   | passkey      |
| twoFactor     | `secret`                   | twoFactor    |

<Callout>
  We intend to add indexing support in our schema generation tool in the future.

title: Migrating from Supabase Auth to Better Auth
description: A step-by-step guide to transitioning from Supabase Auth to Better Auth.
---

In this guide, we'll walk through the steps to migrate a project from Supabase Auth to Better Auth. 

<Callout type="warn">
This migration will invalidate all active sessions. While this guide doesn't currently cover migrating two-factor (2FA) or Row Level Security (RLS) configurations, both should be possible with additional steps.
</Callout>


## Before You Begin

Before starting the migration process, set up Better Auth in your project. Follow the [installation guide](/docs/installation) to get started.


<Steps>
<Step>
### Connect to your database

You'll need to connect to your database to migrate the users and accounts. Copy your `DATABASE_URL` from your Supabase project and use it to connect to your database. And for this example, we'll need to install `pg` to connect to the database.

```package-install
npm install pg
```

And then you can use the following code to connect to your database.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { Pool } from "pg";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    database: new Pool({ 
        connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL 
    }),
})
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Enable Email and Password (Optional)

Enable the email and password in your auth config.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { admin, anonymous } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    database: new Pool({ 
        connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL 
    }),
	emailVerification: {
		sendEmailVerification: async(user)=>{
			// send email verification email
			// implement your own logic here
		}
	},
    emailAndPassword: { // [!code highlight]
        enabled: true, // [!code highlight]
    } // [!code highlight]
})
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Setup Social Providers (Optional)

Add social providers you have enabled in your Supabase project in your auth config.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { admin, anonymous } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    database: new Pool({ 
        connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL 
    }),
    emailAndPassword: { 
        enabled: true,
    },
    socialProviders: { // [!code highlight]
        github: { // [!code highlight]
            clientId: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID, // [!code highlight]
            clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET, // [!code highlight]
        } // [!code highlight]
    } // [!code highlight]
})
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Add admin and anonymous plugins (Optional)

Add the [admin](/docs/plugins/admin) and [anonymous](/docs/plugins/anonymous) plugins to your auth config.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { admin, anonymous } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    database: new Pool({ 
        connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL 
    }),
    emailAndPassword: { 
        enabled: true,
    },
    socialProviders: {
        github: {
            clientId: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID!,
            clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET!,
        }
    },
    plugins: [admin(), anonymous()], // [!code highlight]
})
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Run the migration

Run the migration to create the necessary tables in your database.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx @better-auth/cli migrate
```

This will create the following tables in your database:

- [`user`](/docs/concepts/database#user)
- [`account`](/docs/concepts/database#account)
- [`session`](/docs/concepts/database#session)
- [`verification`](/docs/concepts/database#verification)

This tables will be created on the `public` schema.
</Step>
<Step>
### Copy the migration script

Now that we have the necessary tables in our database, we can run the migration script to migrate the users and accounts from Supabase to Better Auth.

Start by creating a `.ts` file in your project.

```bash title="Terminal"
touch migration.ts
```

And then copy and paste the following code into the file.

```ts title="migration.ts"
import { Pool } from "pg";
import { auth } from "./auth";
import { User as SupabaseUser } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

type User = SupabaseUser & {
	is_super_admin: boolean;
	raw_user_meta_data: {
		avatar_url: string;
	};
	encrypted_password: string;
	email_confirmed_at: string;
	created_at: string;
	updated_at: string;
	is_anonymous: boolean;
	identities: {
		provider: string;
		identity_data: {
			sub: string;
			email: string;
		};
		created_at: string;
		updated_at: string;
	};
};

const migrateFromSupabase = async () => {
	const ctx = await auth.$context;
	const db = ctx.options.database as Pool;
	const users = await db
		.query(`
			SELECT 
				u.*,
				COALESCE(
					json_agg(
						i.* ORDER BY i.id
					) FILTER (WHERE i.id IS NOT NULL),
					'[]'::json
				) as identities
			FROM auth.users u
			LEFT JOIN auth.identities i ON u.id = i.user_id
			GROUP BY u.id
		`)
		.then((res) => res.rows as User[]);
	for (const user of users) {
		if (!user.email) {
			continue;
		}
		await ctx.adapter
			.create({
				model: "user",

</Step>

<Step>
### Customize the migration script (Optional)

- `name`: the migration script will use the user's email as the name. You might want to customize it if you have the user display name in your database.
- `socialProviderList`: the migration script will use the social providers you have enabled in your auth config. You might want to customize it if you have additional social providers that you haven't enabled in your auth config.
- `role`: remove `role` if you're not using the `admin` plugin 
- `isAnonymous`: remove `isAnonymous` if you're not using the `anonymous` plugin.
- update other tables that reference the `users` table to use the `id` field.
</Step>
<Step>
### Run the migration script

Run the migration script to migrate the users and accounts from Supabase to Better Auth.

```bash title="Terminal"
bun migration.ts # or use node, ts-node, etc.
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Update your code

Update your codebase from Supabase auth calls to Better Auth API.

Here's a list of the Supabase auth API calls and their Better Auth counterparts.

- `supabase.auth.signUp` -> `authClient.signUp.email`
- `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword` -> `authClient.signIn.email`
- `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth` -> `authClient.signIn.social`
- `supabase.auth.signInAnonymously` -> `authClient.signIn.anonymous`
- `supabase.auth.signOut` -> `authClient.signOut`
- `supabase.auth.getSession` -> `authClient.getSession` -  you can also use `authClient.useSession` for reactive state

</Steps>

### Middleware

To protect routes with middleware, refer to the [Next.js middleware guide](/docs/integrations/next#middleware) or your framework's documentation.

## Wrapping Up

Congratulations! You've successfully migrated from Supabase Auth to Better Auth.

Better Auth offers greater flexibility and more features—be sure to explore the [documentation](/docs) to unlock its full potential.

title: Create your first plugin
description: A step-by-step guide to creating your first Better Auth plugin.
---

In this guide, we’ll walk you through the steps of creating your first Better Auth plugin.


<Callout type="warn">
This guide assumes you have <Link href="/docs/installation">setup the basics</Link> of Better Auth and are ready to create your first plugin.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
## Plan your idea
Before beginning, you must know what plugin you intend to create.

In this guide, we’ll create a **birthday plugin** to keep track of user birth dates.
</Step>

<Step>
## Server plugin first
Better Auth plugins operate as a pair: a <Link href="/docs/concepts/plugins#create-a-server-plugin">server plugin</Link> and a <Link href="/docs/concepts/plugins#create-a-client-plugin">client plugin</Link>.
The server plugin forms the foundation of your authentication system, while the client plugin provides convenient frontend APIs to interact with your server implementation.


<Callout>
You can read more about server/client plugins in our <Link href="/docs/concepts/plugins#creating-a-plugin">documentation</Link>.
</Callout>

### Creating the server plugin
Go ahead and find a suitable location to create your birthday plugin folder, with an `index.ts` file within.
<Files>
  <Folder name="birthday-plugin" defaultOpen>
    <File name="index.ts" />
  </Folder>
</Files>
In the `index.ts` file, we’ll export a function that represents our server plugin.
This will be what we will later add to our plugin list in the `auth.ts` file.

```ts title="index.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import type { BetterAuthPlugin } from "better-auth";

export const birthdayPlugin = () =>
  ({
    id: "birthdayPlugin",
  } satisfies BetterAuthPlugin);

```
Although this does nothing, you have technically just made yourself your first plugin, congratulations! 🎉

</Step>

<Step>
### Defining a schema
In order to save each user’s birthday data, we must create a schema on top of the `user` model.

By creating a schema here, this also allows <Link href="/docs/concepts/cli">Better Auth’s CLI</Link> to generate the schemas required to update your database.

<Callout type="info">
You can learn more about <Link href="/docs/concepts/plugins#schema">plugin schemas here</Link>.
</Callout>

```ts title="index.ts"
//...
export const birthdayPlugin = () =>
  ({
    id: "birthdayPlugin",
    schema: {// [!code highlight]
      user: {// [!code highlight]
        fields: {// [!code highlight]
          birthday: {// [!code highlight]
            type: "date", // string, number, boolean, date // [!code highlight]
            required: true, // if the field should be required on a new record. (default: false) // [!code highlight]
            unique: false, // if the field should be unique. (default: false) // [!code highlight]
            references: null // if the field is a reference to another table. (default: null) // [!code highlight]
          },// [!code highlight]
        },// [!code highlight]
      },// [!code highlight]
    },
  } satisfies BetterAuthPlugin);
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Authorization logic
For this example guide, we’ll set up authentication logic to check and ensure that the user who signs-up is older than 5.
But the same concept could be applied for something like verifying users agreeing to the TOS or anything alike.

To do this, we’ll utilize <Link href="/docs/concepts/plugins#hooks">Hooks</Link>, which allows us to run code `before` or `after` an action is performed.

```ts title="index.ts"
export const birthdayPlugin = () => ({
    //...
    // In our case, we want to write authorization logic,
    // meaning we want to intercept it `before` hand.
    hooks: {
      before: [
        {
          matcher: (context) => /* ... */,
          handler: createAuthMiddleware(async (ctx) => {
            //...
          }),
        },
      ],
    },
} satisfies BetterAuthPlugin)
```

In our case we want to match any requests going to the signup path:
```ts title="Before hook"
{
  matcher: (context) => context.path.startsWith("/sign-up/email"),
  //...
}
```

And for our logic, we’ll write the following code to check the if user’s birthday makes them above 5 years old.
```ts title="Imports"
import { APIError } from "better-auth/api";
import { createAuthMiddleware } from "better-auth/plugins";
```
```ts title="Before hook"
{
  //...
  handler: createAuthMiddleware(async (ctx) => {
    const { birthday } = ctx.body;
    if(!(birthday instanceof Date)) {
      throw new APIError("BAD_REQUEST", { message: "Birthday must be of type Date." });
    }

    const today = new Date();
    const fiveYearsAgo = new Date(today.setFullYear(today.getFullYear() - 5));

    if(birthday >= fiveYearsAgo) {
      throw new APIError("BAD_REQUEST", { message: "User must be above 5 years old." });
    }

    return { context: ctx };
  }),
}
```

**Authorized!** 🔒

We’ve now successfully written code to ensure authorization for users above 5!

</Step>

<Step>
## Client Plugin
We’re close to the finish line! 🏁

Now that we have created our server plugin, the next step is to develop our client plugin.
Since there isn’t much frontend APIs going on for this plugin, there isn’t much to do!

First, let’s create our `client.ts` file first:
<Files>
  <Folder name="birthday-plugin" defaultOpen>
    <File name="index.ts" />
    <File name="client.ts" />
  </Folder>
</Files>
Then, add the following code:
```ts title="client.ts"
import { BetterAuthClientPlugin } from "better-auth";
import type { birthdayPlugin } from "./index"; // make sure to import the server plugin as a type // [!code highlight]

type BirthdayPlugin = typeof birthdayPlugin;

export const birthdayClientPlugin = () => {
  return {
    id: "birthdayPlugin",
    $InferServerPlugin: {} as ReturnType<BirthdayPlugin>,
  } satisfies BetterAuthClientPlugin;
};
```
What we’ve done is allow the client plugin to infer the types defined by our schema from the server plugin.

And that’s it!  This is all it takes for the birthday client plugin. 🎂

</Step>

<Step>
## Initiate your plugin!
Both the `client` and `server` plugins are now ready, the last step is to import them to both your `auth-client.ts` and your `server.ts` files respectively to initiate the plugin.

### Server initiation
```ts title="server.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { birthdayPlugin } from "./birthday-plugin";// [!code highlight]
 
export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
      birthdayPlugin(),// [!code highlight]
    ]
});
```

### Client initiation
```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import { birthdayClientPlugin } from "./birthday-plugin/client";// [!code highlight]
 
const authClient = createAuthClient({
    plugins: [
      birthdayClientPlugin()// [!code highlight]
    ]
});
```

### Oh yeah, the schemas! 
Don’t forget to add your `birthday` field to your `user` table model! 

Or, use the `generate` <Link href="/docs/concepts/cli#generate">CLI command</Link>:
```bash
npx @better-auth/cli@latest generate
```

</Step>
</Steps>

title: Astro Integration
description: Integrate Better Auth with Astro.
---

Better Auth comes with first class support for Astro. This guide will show you how to integrate Better Auth with Astro.

Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Mount the handler

To enable Better Auth to handle requests, we need to mount the handler to a catch all API route. Create a file inside `/pages/api/auth` called `[...all].ts` and add the following code:

```ts title="pages/api/auth/[...all].ts"
import { auth } from "~/auth";
import type { APIRoute } from "astro";

export const ALL: APIRoute = async (ctx) => {
	// If you want to use rate limiting, make sure to set the 'x-forwarded-for' header to the request headers from the context
	// ctx.request.headers.set("x-forwarded-for", ctx.clientAddress);
	return auth.handler(ctx.request);
};
```

<Callout>
    You can change the path on your better-auth configuration but it's recommended to keep it as `/api/auth/[...all]`
</Callout>

## Create a client

Astro supports multiple frontend frameworks, so you can easily import your client based on the framework you're using.

If you're not using a frontend framework, you can still import the vanilla client.

            export const authClient =  createAuthClient()
            ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Auth Middleware

### Astro Locals types

To have types for your Astro locals, you need to set it inside the `env.d.ts` file.

```ts title="env.d.ts"

/// <reference path="../.astro/types.d.ts" />

declare namespace App {
    // Note: 'import {} from ""' syntax does not work in .d.ts files.
    interface Locals {
        user: import("better-auth").User | null;
        session: import("better-auth").Session | null;
    }
}
```

### Middleware

To protect your routes, you can check if the user is authenticated using the `getSession` method in middleware and set the user and session data using the Astro locals with the types we set before. Start by creating a `middleware.ts` file in the root of your project and follow the example below:

```ts title="middleware.ts"
import { auth } from "@/auth";
import { defineMiddleware } from "astro:middleware";

export const onRequest = defineMiddleware(async (context, next) => {
    const isAuthed = await auth.api
        .getSession({
            headers: context.request.headers,
        })

    if (isAuthed) {
        context.locals.user = isAuthed.user;
        context.locals.session = isAuthed.session;
    } else {
        context.locals.user = null;
        context.locals.session = null;
    }

    return next();
});
```

### Getting session on the server inside `.astro` file

You can use `Astro.locals` to check if the user has session and get the user data from the server side. Here is an example of how you can get the session inside an `.astro` file:

```astro
---
import { UserCard } from "@/components/user-card";

const session = () => {
    if (Astro.locals.session) {
        return Astro.locals.session;
    } else {
        // Redirect to login page if the user is not authenticated
        return Astro.redirect("/login");
    }
}

---

<UserCard initialSession={session} />
```
</file>

<file path="docs/better-auth/integrations/elysia.mdx">
---
title: Elysia Integration
description: Integrate Better Auth with Elysia.
---

This integration guide is assuming you are using Elysia with bun server.

Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Mount the handler

We need to mount the handler to Elysia endpoint.

```ts
import { Elysia } from "elysia";
import { auth } from "./auth";

const app = new Elysia().mount(auth.handler).listen(3000);

console.log(
  `🦊 Elysia is running at ${app.server?.hostname}:${app.server?.port}`,
);
```

### CORS

To configure cors, you can use the `cors` plugin from `@elysiajs/cors`.

```ts
import { Elysia } from "elysia";
import { cors } from "@elysiajs/cors";

import { auth } from "./auth";

const app = new Elysia()
  .use(
    cors({
      origin: "http://localhost:3001",
      methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],
      credentials: true,
      allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
    }),
  )
  .mount(auth.handler)
  .listen(3000);

console.log(
  `🦊 Elysia is running at ${app.server?.hostname}:${app.server?.port}`,
);
```

### Macro

You can use [macro](https://elysiajs.com/patterns/macro.html#macro) with [resolve](https://elysiajs.com/essential/handler.html#resolve) to provide session and user information before pass to view.

```ts
import { Elysia } from "elysia";
import { auth } from "./auth";

// user middleware (compute user and session and pass to routes)
const betterAuth = new Elysia({ name: "better-auth" })
  .mount(auth.handler)
  .macro({
    auth: {
      async resolve({ status, request: { headers } }) {
        const session = await auth.api.getSession({
          headers,
        });

        if (!session) return status(401);

        return {
          user: session.user,
          session: session.session,
        };
      },
    },
  });

const app = new Elysia()
  .use(betterAuth)
  .get("/user", ({ user }) => user, {
    auth: true,
  })
  .listen(3000);

console.log(
  `🦊 Elysia is running at ${app.server?.hostname}:${app.server?.port}`,
);
```

This will allow you to access the `user` and `session` object in all of your routes.

<file path="docs/better-auth/integrations/expo.mdx">
---
title: Expo Integration
description: Integrate Better Auth with Expo.
---

Expo is a popular framework for building cross-platform apps with React Native. Better Auth supports both Expo native and web apps.

## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ## Configure A Better Auth Backend
        Before using Better Auth with Expo, make sure you have a Better Auth backend set up. You can either use a separate server or leverage Expo's new [API Routes](https://docs.expo.dev/router/reference/api-routes) feature to host your Better Auth instance.

        To get started, check out our [installation](/docs/installation) guide for setting up Better Auth on your server. If you prefer to check out the full example, you can find it [here](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/tree/main/examples/expo-example).

        To use the new API routes feature in Expo to host your Better Auth instance you can create a new API route in your Expo app and mount the Better Auth handler.

        ```ts title="app/api/auth/[...auth]+api.ts"
        import { auth } from "@/lib/auth"; // import Better Auth handler
        
        const handler = auth.handler;
        export { handler as GET, handler as POST }; // export handler for both GET and POST requests
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ## Install Server Dependencies

        Install both the Better Auth package and Expo plugin into your server application.

        ```package-install
        better-auth @better-auth/expo
        ```

    </Step>

    <Step>
        ## Install Client Dependencies

        You also need to install both the Better Auth package and Expo plugin into your Expo application.

        ```package-install
        better-auth @better-auth/expo 
        ```

        If you plan on using our social integrations (Google, Apple etc.) then there are a few more dependencies that are required in your Expo app. In the default Expo template these are already installed so you may be able to skip this step if you have these dependencies already.

        ```package-install
        expo-linking expo-web-browser expo-constants
        
        ```
    </Step>
    
    <Step>
        ## Add the Expo Plugin on Your Server

        Add the Expo plugin to your Better Auth server.

        ```ts title="lib/auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
        import { expo } from "@better-auth/expo";

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            plugins: [expo()],
            emailAndPassword: { 
                enabled: true, // Enable authentication using email and password.
              }, 
        });
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ## Initialize Better Auth Client
        
        To initialize Better Auth in your Expo app, you need to call `createAuthClient` with the base URL of your Better Auth backend. Make sure to import the client from `/react`.

        Make sure you install the `expo-secure-store` package into your Expo app. This is used to store the session data and cookies securely.

        ```package-install
        expo-secure-store
        ```

        You need to also import client plugin from `@better-auth/expo/client` and pass it to the `plugins` array when initializing the auth client.

        This is important because:

        - **Social Authentication Support:** enables social auth flows by handling authorization URLs and callbacks within the Expo web browser.
        - **Secure Cookie Management:** stores cookies securely and automatically adds them to the headers of your auth requests.

        ```ts title="lib/auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";
        import { expoClient } from "@better-auth/expo/client";
        import * as SecureStore from "expo-secure-store";

        export const authClient = createAuthClient({
            baseURL: "http://localhost:8081", // Base URL of your Better Auth backend.
            plugins: [
                expoClient({
                    scheme: "myapp",
                    storagePrefix: "myapp",
                    storage: SecureStore,
                })
            ]
        });
        ```
        <Callout>
         Be sure to include the full URL, including the path, if you've changed the default path from `/api/auth`.
        </Callout>
    </Step>

     <Step>
        ## Scheme and Trusted Origins

        Better Auth uses deep links to redirect users back to your app after authentication. To enable this, you need to add your app's scheme to the `trustedOrigins` list in your Better Auth config. 

        First, make sure you have a scheme defined in your `app.json` file.

        ```json title="app.json"
        {
            "expo": {
                "scheme": "myapp"
            }
        }
        ```

        Then, update your Better Auth config to include the scheme in the `trustedOrigins` list.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        export const auth = betterAuth({
            trustedOrigins: ["myapp://"]
        })
        ```

        If you have multiple schemes or need to support deep linking with various paths, you can use specific patterns or wildcards:

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        export const auth = betterAuth({
            trustedOrigins: [
                // Basic scheme
                "myapp://", 
                
                // Production & staging schemes
                "myapp-prod://",
                "myapp-staging://",
                
                // Wildcard support for all paths following the scheme
                "myapp://*"
            ]
        })
        ```

        <Callout>
          The wildcard pattern can be particularly useful if your app uses different URL formats for deep linking based on features or screens.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
 
    <Step>
        ## Configure Metro Bundler

        To resolve Better Auth exports you'll need to enable `unstable_enablePackageExports` in your metro config. 

        ```js title="metro.config.js"
        const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");

        const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname)

        config.resolver.unstable_enablePackageExports = true; // [!code highlight]

        module.exports = config;
        ```

        <Callout>In case you don't have a `metro.config.js` file in your project run `npx expo customize metro.config.js`.</Callout>
        
        If you can't enable `unstable_enablePackageExports` option, you can use [babel-plugin-module-resolver](https://github.com/tleunen/babel-plugin-module-resolver) to manually resolve the paths.

        ```ts title="babel.config.js"
        module.exports = function (api) {
            api.cache(true);
            return {
                presets: ["babel-preset-expo"],
                plugins: [
                    [
                        "module-resolver",
                        {
                            alias: {
                                "better-auth/react": "./node_modules/better-auth/dist/client/react/index.cjs",
                                "better-auth/client/plugins": "./node_modules/better-auth/dist/client/plugins/index.cjs",
                                "@better-auth/expo/client": "./node_modules/@better-auth/expo/dist/client.cjs",
                            },
                        },
                    ],
                ],
            }
        }
        ```

        <Callout>In case you don't have a `babel.config.js` file in your project run `npx expo customize babel.config.js`.</Callout>

        Don't forget to clear the cache after making changes.

        ```bash
        npx expo start --clear
        ```

    </Step>
</Steps>


## Usage

### Authenticating Users

With Better Auth initialized, you can now use the `authClient` to authenticate users in your Expo app.

<Tabs items={["sign-in", "sign-up"]}>
    <Tab value="sign-in">
        ```tsx title="app/sign-in.tsx"
        import { useState } from "react"; 
        import { View, TextInput, Button } from "react-native";
        import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client";

        export default function SignIn() {
            const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
            const [password, setPassword] = useState("");

            const handleLogin = async () => {
                await authClient.signIn.email({
                    email,
                    password,
                })
            };

                    <Button title="Login" onPress={handleLogin} />
                </View>
            );
        }
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="sign-up">
        ```tsx title="app/sign-up.tsx"
        import { useState } from "react";
        import { View, TextInput, Button } from "react-native";
        import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client";

        export default function SignUp() {
            const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
            const [name, setName] = useState("");
            const [password, setPassword] = useState("");

            const handleLogin = async () => {

            );
        }
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Social Sign-In

For social sign-in, you can use the `authClient.signIn.social` method with the provider name and a callback URL.

```tsx title="app/social-sign-in.tsx"
import { Button } from "react-native";

export default function SocialSignIn() {
    const handleLogin = async () => {
        await authClient.signIn.social({
            provider: "google",
            callbackURL: "/dashboard" // this will be converted to a deep link (eg. `myapp://dashboard`) on native
        })
    };
    return <Button title="Login with Google" onPress={handleLogin} />;
}
```

#### IdToken Sign-In

If you want to make provider request on the mobile device and then verify the ID token on the server, you can use the `authClient.signIn.social` method with the `idToken` option.

```tsx title="app/social-sign-in.tsx"
import { Button } from "react-native";

export default function SocialSignIn() {
    const handleLogin = async () => {
        await authClient.signIn.social({
            provider: "google", // only google, apple and facebook are supported for idToken signIn
            idToken: {
                token: "...", // ID token from provider
                nonce: "...", // nonce from provider (optional)
            }
            callbackURL: "/dashboard" // this will be converted to a deep link (eg. `myapp://dashboard`) on native
        })
    };
    return <Button title="Login with Google" onPress={handleLogin} />;
}
```

### Session

Better Auth provides a `useSession` hook to access the current user's session in your app.

```tsx title="app/index.tsx"
import { Text } from "react-native";
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client";

export default function Index() {
    const { data: session } = authClient.useSession();

    return <Text>Welcome, {session?.user.name}</Text>;
}
```

On native, the session data will be cached in SecureStore. This will allow you to remove the need for a loading spinner when the app is reloaded. You can disable this behavior by passing the `disableCache` option to the client.


### Making Authenticated Requests to Your Server

To make authenticated requests to your server that require the user's session, you have to retrieve the session cookie from `SecureStore` and manually add it to your request headers.

```tsx
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client";

const makeAuthenticatedRequest = async () => {
  const cookies = authClient.getCookie(); // [!code highlight]
  const headers = {
    "Cookie": cookies, // [!code highlight]
  };
  const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8081/api/secure-endpoint", { headers });
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
};
```

**Example: Usage With TRPC**
    
```tsx title="lib/trpc-provider.tsx"
//...other imports
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client"; // [!code highlight]

export const api = createTRPCReact<AppRouter>();

export function TRPCProvider(props: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [queryClient] = useState(() => new QueryClient());
  const [trpcClient] = useState(() =>
    api.createClient({
      links: [
        httpBatchLink({
          //...your other options
          headers() {
            const headers = new Map<string, string>(); // [!code highlight]
            const cookies = authClient.getCookie(); // [!code highlight]
            if (cookies) { // [!code highlight]
              headers.set("Cookie", cookies); // [!code highlight]
            } // [!code highlight]
            return Object.fromEntries(headers); // [!code highlight]
          },
        }),
      ],
    }),
  );

  return (
    <api.Provider client={trpcClient} queryClient={queryClient}>
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        {props.children}
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </api.Provider>
  );
}
```


## Options

### Expo Client

**storage**: the storage mechanism used to cache the session data and cookies.

```ts title="lib/auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";
import SecureStorage from "expo-secure-store";

const authClient = createAuthClient({
    baseURL: "http://localhost:8081",
    storage: SecureStorage
});
```

**scheme**: scheme is used to deep link back to your app after a user has authenticated using oAuth providers. By default, Better Auth tries to read the scheme from the `app.json` file. If you need to override this, you can pass the scheme option to the client.

```ts title="lib/auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";

const authClient = createAuthClient({
    baseURL: "http://localhost:8081",
    scheme: "myapp"
});
```

**disableCache**: By default, the client will cache the session data in SecureStore. You can disable this behavior by passing the `disableCache` option to the client.

```ts title="lib/auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";

const authClient = createAuthClient({
    baseURL: "http://localhost:8081",
    disableCache: true
});
```


### Expo Servers

Server plugin options:

**overrideOrigin**: Override the origin for Expo API routes (default: false). Enable this if you're facing cors origin issues with Expo API routes.
</file>

<file path="docs/better-auth/integrations/express.mdx">
---
title: Express Integration
description: Integrate Better Auth with Express.
---

This guide will show you how to integrate Better Auth with [express.js](https://expressjs.com/).

Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

<Callout>
Note that CommonJS (cjs) isn't supported. Use ECMAScript Modules (ESM) by setting `"type": "module"` in your `package.json` or configuring your `tsconfig.json` to use ES modules.
</Callout>

### Mount the handler

To enable Better Auth to handle requests, we need to mount the handler to an API route. Create a catch-all route to manage all requests to `/api/auth/*` in case of ExpressJS v4 or `/api/auth/*splat` in case of ExpressJS v5 (or any other path specified in your Better Auth options).

<Callout type="warn">
Don’t use `express.json()` before the Better Auth handler. Use it only for other routes, or the client API will get stuck on "pending".
</Callout>

```ts title="server.ts"
import express from "express";
import { toNodeHandler } from "better-auth/node";
import { auth } from "./auth";

const app = express();
const port = 3005;

app.all("/api/auth/*", toNodeHandler(auth)); // For ExpressJS v4
// app.all("/api/auth/*splat", toNodeHandler(auth)); For ExpressJS v5 

// Mount express json middleware after Better Auth handler
// or only apply it to routes that don't interact with Better Auth
app.use(express.json());

app.listen(port, () => {
	console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

After completing the setup, start your server. Better Auth will be ready to use. You can send a `GET` request to the `/ok` endpoint (`/api/auth/ok`) to verify that the server is running.


### Cors Configuration

To add CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) support to your Express server when integrating Better Auth, you can use the `cors` middleware. Below is an updated example showing how to configure CORS for your server:

```ts
import express from "express";
import cors from "cors"; // Import the CORS middleware
import { toNodeHandler, fromNodeHeaders } from "better-auth/node";
import { auth } from "./auth";

const app = express();
const port = 3005;

// Configure CORS middleware
app.use(
  cors({
    origin: "http://your-frontend-domain.com", // Replace with your frontend's origin
    methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"], // Specify allowed HTTP methods
    credentials: true, // Allow credentials (cookies, authorization headers, etc.)
  })
);
```

### Getting the User Session

To retrieve the user's session, you can use the `getSession` method provided by the `auth` object. This method requires the request headers to be passed in a specific format. To simplify this process, Better Auth provides a `fromNodeHeaders` helper function that converts Node.js request headers to the format expected by Better Auth (a `Headers` object).

Here's an example of how to use `getSession` in an Express route:

```ts title="server.ts"
import { fromNodeHeaders } from "better-auth/node";
import { auth } from "./auth"; // Your Better Auth instance

app.get("/api/me", async (req, res) => {
 	const session = await auth.api.getSession({
      headers: fromNodeHeaders(req.headers),
    });
	return res.json(session);
});
```
</file>

<file path="docs/better-auth/integrations/fastify.mdx">
---
title: Better Auth Fastify Integration Guide
description: Learn how to seamlessly integrate Better Auth with your Fastify application.
---

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for configuring both essential handlers and CORS settings.

<Callout type="important">
A configured Better Auth instance is required before proceeding. If you haven't set this up yet, please consult our [Installation Guide](/docs/installation).
</Callout>

### Prerequisites

Verify the following requirements before integration:

- **Node.js Environment**: v16 or later installed
- **ES Module Support**: Enable ES modules in either:
  - `package.json`: `{ "type": "module" }`
  - TypeScript `tsconfig.json`: `{ "module": "ESNext" }`
- **Fastify Dependencies**:
  ```package-install
  fastify @fastify/cors
  ```

<Callout type="tip"> For TypeScript: Ensure your `tsconfig.json` includes `"esModuleInterop": true` for optimal compatibility. </Callout>

### Authentication Handler Setup

Configure Better Auth to process authentication requests by creating a catch-all route:

```ts title="server.ts"
import Fastify from "fastify";
import { auth } from "./auth"; // Your configured Better Auth instance

const fastify = Fastify({ logger: true });

// Register authentication endpoint
fastify.route({
  method: ["GET", "POST"],
  url: "/api/auth/*",
  async handler(request, reply) {
    try {
      // Construct request URL
      const url = new URL(request.url, `http://${request.headers.host}`);
      
      // Convert Fastify headers to standard Headers object
      const headers = new Headers();
      Object.entries(request.headers).forEach(([key, value]) => {
        if (value) headers.append(key, value.toString());
      });

      // Create Fetch API-compatible request
      const req = new Request(url.toString(), {
        method: request.method,
        headers,
        body: request.body ? JSON.stringify(request.body) : undefined,
      });

      // Process authentication request
      const response = await auth.handler(req);

      // Forward response to client
      reply.status(response.status);
      response.headers.forEach((value, key) => reply.header(key, value));
      reply.send(response.body ? await response.text() : null);

    } catch (error) {
      fastify.log.error("Authentication Error:", error);
      reply.status(500).send({ 
        error: "Internal authentication error",
        code: "AUTH_FAILURE"
      });
    }
  }
});

// Initialize server
fastify.listen({ port: 4000 }, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  console.log("Server running on port 4000");
});
```

### Trusted origins

When a request is made from a different origin, the request will be blocked by default. You can add trusted origins to the `auth` instance.

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
  trustedOrigins: ["http://localhost:3000", "https://example.com"],
});
```

### Configuring CORS

Secure your API endpoints with proper CORS configuration:

```ts
import fastifyCors from "@fastify/cors";

// Configure CORS policies
fastify.register(fastifyCors, {
  origin: process.env.CLIENT_ORIGIN || "http://localhost:3000",
  methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],
  allowedHeaders: [
    "Content-Type",
    "Authorization",
    "X-Requested-With"
  ],
  credentials: true,
  maxAge: 86400
});

// Mount authentication handler after CORS registration
// (Use previous handler configuration here)
```

<Callout type="warning"> Always restrict CORS origins in production environments. Use environment variables for dynamic configuration. </Callout>
</file>

<file path="docs/better-auth/integrations/hono.mdx">
---
title: Hono Integration
description: Integrate Better Auth with Hono.
---

Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Mount the handler

We need to mount the handler to Hono endpoint.

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { auth } from "./auth";
import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";
import { cors } from "hono/cors";

const app = new Hono();

app.on(["POST", "GET"], "/api/auth/*", (c) => {
	return auth.handler(c.req.raw);
});

serve(app);
```

### Cors

To configure cors, you need to use the `cors` plugin from `hono/cors`.

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { auth } from "./auth";
import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";
import { cors } from "hono/cors";
 
const app = new Hono();

app.use(
	"/api/auth/*", // or replace with "*" to enable cors for all routes
	cors({
		origin: "http://localhost:3001", // replace with your origin
		allowHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
		allowMethods: ["POST", "GET", "OPTIONS"],
		exposeHeaders: ["Content-Length"],
		maxAge: 600,
		credentials: true,
	}),
);

app.on(["POST", "GET"], "/api/auth/*", (c) => {
	return auth.handler(c.req.raw);
});

serve(app);
```

> **Important:** CORS middleware must be registered before your routes. This ensures that cross-origin requests are properly handled before they reach your authentication endpoints.

### Middleware

You can add a middleware to save the `session` and `user` in a `context` and also add validations for every route.

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { auth } from "./auth";
import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";
import { cors } from "hono/cors";
 
const app = new Hono<{
	Variables: {
		user: typeof auth.$Infer.Session.user | null;
		session: typeof auth.$Infer.Session.session | null
	}
}>();

app.use("*", async (c, next) => {
	const session = await auth.api.getSession({ headers: c.req.raw.headers });

  	if (!session) {
    	c.set("user", null);
    	c.set("session", null);
    	return next();
  	}

  	c.set("user", session.user);
  	c.set("session", session.session);
  	return next();
});

app.on(["POST", "GET"], "/api/auth/*", (c) => {
	return auth.handler(c.req.raw);
});


serve(app);
```

This will allow you to access the `user` and `session` object in all of your routes.

```ts
app.get("/session", (c) => {
	const session = c.get("session")
	const user = c.get("user")
	
	if(!user) return c.body(null, 401);

  	return c.json({
	  session,
	  user
	});
});
```

### Cross-Domain Cookies

By default, all Better Auth cookies are set with `SameSite=Lax`. If you need to use cookies across different domains, you’ll need to set `SameSite=None` and `Secure=true`. However, we recommend using subdomains whenever possible, as this allows you to keep `SameSite=Lax`. To enable cross-subdomain cookies, simply turn on `crossSubDomainCookies` in your auth config.

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = createAuth({
  advanced: {
    crossSubDomainCookies: {
      enabled: true
    }
  }
})
```

If you still need to set `SameSite=None` and `Secure=true`, you can adjust these attributes globally through `cookieOptions` in the `createAuth` configuration.

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = createAuth({
  advanced: {
    defaultCookieAttributes: {
      sameSite: "none",
      secure: true,
      partitioned: true // New browser standards will mandate this for foreign cookies
    }
  }
})
```

You can also customize cookie attributes individually by setting them within `cookies` in your auth config.

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = createAuth({
  advanced: {
    cookies: {
      sessionToken: {
        attributes: {
          sameSite: "none",
          secure: true,
          partitioned: true // New browser standards will mandate this for foreign cookies
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Client-Side Configuration

When using the Hono client (`@hono/client`) to make requests to your Better Auth-protected endpoints, you need to configure it to send credentials (cookies) with cross-origin requests.

```ts title="api.ts"
import { hc } from "hono/client";
import type { AppType } from "./server"; // Your Hono app type

const client = hc<AppType>("http://localhost:8787/", {
  fetch: ((input, init) => {
    return fetch(input, { 
      ...init, 
      credentials: "include" // Required for sending cookies cross-origin
    });
  }) satisfies typeof fetch,
});

// Now your client requests will include credentials
const response = await client.someProtectedEndpoint.$get();
```

This configuration is necessary when:
- Your client and server are on different domains/ports during development
- You're making cross-origin requests in production
- You need to send authentication cookies with your requests

The `credentials: "include"` option tells the fetch client to send cookies even for cross-origin requests. This works in conjunction with the CORS configuration on your server that has `credentials: true`.

> **Note:** Make sure your CORS configuration on the server matches your client's domain, and that `credentials: true` is set in both the server's CORS config and the client's fetch config.

title: NestJS Integration
description: Integrate Better Auth with NestJS.
---

This guide will show you how to integrate Better Auth with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/).

Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

<Callout type="info">
The NestJS integration is **community maintained**. If you encounter any issues, please open them at [nestjs-better-auth](https://github.com/ThallesP/nestjs-better-auth).
</Callout>

## Installation

Install the NestJS integration library:

```package-install
@thallesp/nestjs-better-auth
```

## Basic Setup

<Callout type="warn">
Currently, Better Auth's NestJS integration **only supports Express** and does not work with Fastify.
</Callout>

### 1. Disable Body Parser

Disable NestJS's built-in body parser to allow Better Auth to handle the raw request body:

```ts title="main.ts"
import { NestFactory } from "@nestjs/core";
import { AppModule } from "./app.module";

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule, {
    bodyParser: false, // Required for Better Auth
  });
  await app.listen(process.env.PORT ?? 3000);
}
bootstrap();
```

### 2. Import AuthModule

Import the `AuthModule` in your root module:

```ts title="app.module.ts"
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthModule } from '@thallesp/nestjs-better-auth';
import { auth } from "./auth"; // Your Better Auth instance

@Module({
  imports: [
    AuthModule.forRoot(auth),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### 3. Protect Routes

Use the `AuthGuard` to protect your routes:

```ts title="user.controller.ts"
import { Controller, Get, UseGuards } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthGuard, Session, UserSession } from '@thallesp/nestjs-better-auth';

@Controller('users')
@UseGuards(AuthGuard)
export class UserController {
  @Get('me')
  async getProfile(@Session() session: UserSession) {
    return { user: session.user };
  }
}
```

## Full Documentation

For comprehensive documentation including decorators, hooks, global guards, and advanced configuration, visit the [NestJS Better Auth repository](https://github.com/thallesp/nestjs-better-auth).
</file>

<file path="docs/better-auth/integrations/next.mdx">
---
title: Next.js integration
description: Integrate Better Auth with Next.js.
---

Better Auth can be easily integrated with Next.js. Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Create API Route

We need to mount the handler to an API route. Create a route file inside `/api/auth/[...all]` directory. And add the following code:

```ts title="api/auth/[...all]/route.ts"
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth";
import { toNextJsHandler } from "better-auth/next-js";

export const { GET, POST } = toNextJsHandler(auth.handler);
```

<Callout type="info">
 You can change the path on your better-auth configuration but it's recommended to keep it as `/api/auth/[...all]`
</Callout>


For `pages` route, you need to use `toNodeHandler` instead of `toNextJsHandler` and set `bodyParser` to `false` in the `config` object. Here is an example:

```ts title="pages/api/auth/[...all].ts"
import { toNodeHandler } from "better-auth/node"
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth"

// Disallow body parsing, we will parse it manually
export const config = { api: { bodyParser: false } }

export default toNodeHandler(auth.handler)
```

## Create a client

Create a client instance. You can name the file anything you want. Here we are creating `client.ts` file inside the `lib/` directory.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react" // make sure to import from better-auth/react

export const authClient =  createAuthClient({
    //you can pass client configuration here
})
```

Once you have created the client, you can use it to sign up, sign in, and perform other actions.
Some of the actions are reactive. The client uses [nano-store](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) to store the state and re-render the components when the state changes.

The client also uses [better-fetch](https://github.com/bekacru/better-fetch) to make the requests. You can pass the fetch configuration to the client.


## RSC and Server actions

The `api` object exported from the auth instance contains all the actions that you can perform on the server. Every endpoint made inside Better Auth is a invocable as a function. Including plugins endpoints.

**Example: Getting Session on a server action**

```tsx title="server.ts"
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth"
import { headers } from "next/headers"

const someAuthenticatedAction = async () => {
    "use server";
    const session = await auth.api.getSession({
        headers: await headers()
    })
};
```

**Example: Getting Session on a RSC**


```tsx
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth"
import { headers } from "next/headers"

export async function ServerComponent() {
    const session = await auth.api.getSession({
        headers: await headers()
    })
    if(!session) {
        return <div>Not authenticated</div>
    }
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Welcome {session.user.name}</h1>
        </div>
    )
}
```

<Callout type="warn">As RSCs cannot set cookies, the [cookie cache](/docs/concepts/session-management#cookie-cache) will not be refreshed until the server is interacted with from the client via Server Actions or Route Handlers.</Callout>

### Server Action Cookies

When you call a function that needs to set cookies, like `signInEmail` or `signUpEmail` in a server action, cookies won’t be set. This is because server actions need to use the `cookies` helper from Next.js to set cookies.

To simplify this, you can use the `nextCookies` plugin, which will automatically set cookies for you whenever a `Set-Cookie` header is present in the response.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { nextCookies } from "better-auth/next-js";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    //...your config
    plugins: [nextCookies()] // make sure this is the last plugin in the array // [!code highlight]
})
```

Now, when you call functions that set cookies, they will be automatically set.

```ts
"use server";
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth"

const signIn = async () => {
    await auth.api.signInEmail({
        body: {
            email: "user@email.com",
            password: "password",
        }
    })
}
```

## Middleware

In Next.js middleware, it's recommended to only check for the existence of a session cookie to handle redirection. To avoid blocking requests by making API or database calls.

You can use the `getSessionCookie` helper from Better Auth for this purpose:

<Callout type="warn">
The <code>getSessionCookie()</code> function does not automatically reference the auth config specified in <code>auth.ts</code>. Therefore, if you customized the cookie name or prefix, you need to ensure that the configuration in <code>getSessionCookie()</code> matches the config defined in your <code>auth.ts</code>.
</Callout>

```ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { getSessionCookie } from "better-auth/cookies";

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
	const sessionCookie = getSessionCookie(request);

    // THIS IS NOT SECURE!
    // This is the recommended approach to optimistically redirect users
    // We recommend handling auth checks in each page/route
	if (!sessionCookie) {
		return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/", request.url));
	}

	return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
	matcher: ["/dashboard"], // Specify the routes the middleware applies to
};
```

<Callout type="warn">
	**Security Warning:** The `getSessionCookie` function only checks for the
	existence of a session cookie; it does **not** validate it. Relying solely
	on this check for security is dangerous, as anyone can manually create a
	cookie to bypass it. You must always validate the session on your server for
	any protected actions or pages.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
If you have a custom cookie name or prefix, you can pass it to the `getSessionCookie` function.
```ts
const sessionCookie = getSessionCookie(request, {
    cookieName: "my_session_cookie",
    cookiePrefix: "my_prefix"
});
```
</Callout>

Alternatively, you can use the `getCookieCache` helper to get the session object from the cookie cache.

```ts
import { getCookieCache } from "better-auth/cookies";

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
	const session = await getCookieCache(request);
	if (!session) {
		return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/sign-in", request.url));
	}
	return NextResponse.next();
}
```

### How to handle auth checks in each page/route

In this example, we are using the `auth.api.getSession` function within a server component to get the session object,
then we are checking if the session is valid. If it's not, we are redirecting the user to the sign-in page.

```tsx title="app/dashboard/page.tsx"
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth";
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";

export default async function DashboardPage() {
    const session = await auth.api.getSession({
        headers: await headers()
    })

    if(!session) {
        redirect("/sign-in")
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Welcome {session.user.name}</h1>
        </div>
    )
}
```

### For Next.js release `15.1.7` and below

If you need the full session object, you'll have to fetch it from the `/get-session` API route. Since Next.js middleware doesn't support running Node.js APIs directly, you must make an HTTP request.

<Callout>
The example uses [better-fetch](https://better-fetch.vercel.app), but you can use any fetch library.
</Callout>

```ts
import { betterFetch } from "@better-fetch/fetch";
import type { auth } from "@/lib/auth";
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";

type Session = typeof auth.$Infer.Session;

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
	const { data: session } = await betterFetch<Session>("/api/auth/get-session", {
		baseURL: request.nextUrl.origin,
		headers: {
			cookie: request.headers.get("cookie") || "", // Forward the cookies from the request
		},
	});

	if (!session) {
		return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/sign-in", request.url));
	}

	return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
	matcher: ["/dashboard"], // Apply middleware to specific routes
};
```

### For Next.js release `15.2.0` and above

From the version 15.2.0, Next.js allows you to use the `Node.js` runtime in middleware. This means you can use the `auth.api` object directly in middleware.

<Callout type="warn">
You may refer to the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#runtime) for more information about runtime configuration, and how to enable it.
Be careful when using the new runtime. It's an experimental feature and it may be subject to breaking changes.
</Callout>

```ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth";

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
    const session = await auth.api.getSession({
        headers: await headers()
    })

    if(!session) {
        return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/sign-in", request.url));
    }

    return NextResponse.next();
}

export const config = {
  runtime: "nodejs",
  matcher: ["/dashboard"], // Apply middleware to specific routes
};
```
</file>

<file path="docs/better-auth/integrations/nitro.mdx">
---
title: Nitro Integration
description: Integrate Better Auth with Nitro.
---

Better Auth can be integrated with your [Nitro Application](https://nitro.build/) (an open source framework to build web servers).

This guide aims to help you integrate Better Auth with your Nitro application in a few simple steps.

## Create a new Nitro Application

Start by scaffolding a new Nitro application using the following command:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx giget@latest nitro nitro-app --install
```

This will create the `nitro-app` directory and install all the dependencies. You can now open the `nitro-app` directory in your code editor.

### Prisma Adapter Setup

<Callout>
  This guide assumes that you have a basic understanding of Prisma. If you are new to Prisma, you can check out the [Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started).

  The `sqlite` database used in this guide will not work in a production environment. You should replace it with a production-ready database like `PostgreSQL`.
</Callout>

For this guide, we will be using the Prisma adapter. You can install prisma client by running the following command:

```package-install
@prisma/client
```

`prisma` can be installed as a dev dependency using the following command:

```package-install
-D prisma
```

Generate a `schema.prisma` file in the `prisma` directory by running the following command:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx prisma init
```

You can now replace the contents of the `schema.prisma` file with the following:

```prisma title="prisma/schema.prisma"
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

// Will be deleted. Just need it to generate the prisma client
model Test {
  id   Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name String
}
```

Ensure that you update the `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file to point to the location of your database.

```env title=".env"
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

Run the following command to generate the Prisma client & sync the database:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx prisma db push
```

### Install & Configure Better Auth

Follow steps 1 & 2 from the [installation guide](/docs/installation) to install Better Auth in your Nitro application & set up the environment variables.

Once that is done, create your Better Auth instance within the `server/utils/auth.ts` file.

```ts title="server/utils/auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { prismaAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/prisma";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();
export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: prismaAdapter(prisma, { provider: "sqlite" }),
  emailAndPassword: { enabled: true },
});
```

### Update Prisma Schema

Use the Better Auth CLI to update your Prisma schema with the required models by running the following command:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx @better-auth/cli generate --config server/utils/auth.ts
```

<Callout>
  The `--config` flag is used to specify the path to the file where you have created your Better Auth instance.
</Callout>

Head over to the `prisma/schema.prisma` file & save the file to trigger the format on save.

After saving the file, you can run the `npx prisma db push` command to update the database schema.

## Mount The Handler

You can now mount the Better Auth handler in your Nitro application. You can do this by adding the following code to your `server/routes/api/auth/[...all].ts` file:

```ts title="server/routes/api/auth/[...all].ts"
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  return auth.handler(toWebRequest(event));
});
```
<Callout>
  This is a [catch-all](https://nitro.build/guide/routing#catch-all-route) route that will handle all requests to `/api/auth/*`.
</Callout>

### CORS

You can configure CORS for your Nitro app by creating a plugin.

Start by installing the cors package:

```package-install
cors
```

You can now create a new file `server/plugins/cors.ts` and add the following code:

```ts title="server/plugins/cors.ts"
import cors from "cors";
export default defineNitroPlugin((plugin) => {
  plugin.h3App.use(
    fromNodeMiddleware(
      cors({
        origin: "*",
      }),
    ),
  );
});
```
<Callout>
  This will enable CORS for all routes. You can customize the `origin` property to allow requests from specific domains. Ensure that the config is in sync with your frontend application.
</Callout>

### Auth Guard/Middleware

You can add an auth guard to your Nitro application to protect routes that require authentication. You can do this by creating a new file `server/utils/require-auth.ts` and adding the following code:

```ts title="server/utils/require-auth.ts"
import { EventHandler, H3Event } from "h3";
import { fromNodeHeaders } from "better-auth/node";

/**
 * Middleware used to require authentication for a route.
 *
 * Can be extended to check for specific roles or permissions.
 */
export const requireAuth: EventHandler = async (event: H3Event) => {
  const headers = event.headers;

  const session = await auth.api.getSession({
    headers: headers,
  });
  if (!session)
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 401,
      statusMessage: "Unauthorized",
    });
  // You can save the session to the event context for later use
  event.context.auth = session;
};
```

You can now use this event handler/middleware in your routes to protect them:

```ts title="server/routes/api/secret.get.ts"
// Object syntax of the route handler
export default defineEventHandler({
  // The user has to be logged in to access this route
  onRequest: [requireAuth],
  handler: async (event) => {
    setResponseStatus(event, 201, "Secret data");
    return { message: "Secret data" };
  },
});
```

### Example

You can find an example of a Nitro application integrated with Better Auth & Prisma [here](https://github.com/BayBreezy/nitrojs-better-auth-prisma).
</file>

<file path="docs/better-auth/integrations/nuxt.mdx">
---
title: Nuxt Integration
description: Integrate Better Auth with Nuxt.
---

Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Create API Route

We need to mount the handler to an API route. Create a file inside `/server/api/auth` called `[...all].ts` and add the following code:

```ts title="server/api/auth/[...all].ts"
import { auth } from "~/lib/auth"; // import your auth config

export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
	return auth.handler(toWebRequest(event));
});
```
<Callout type="info">
 You can change the path on your better-auth configuration but it's recommended to keep it as `/api/auth/[...all]`
</Callout>

### Migrate the database

Run the following command to create the necessary tables in your database:

```bash
npx @better-auth/cli migrate
```

## Create a client

Create a client instance. You can name the file anything you want. Here we are creating `client.ts` file inside the `lib/` directory.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/vue" // make sure to import from better-auth/vue

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
    //you can pass client configuration here
})
```

Once you have created the client, you can use it to sign up, sign in, and perform other actions.
Some of the actions are reactive.

### Example usage

```vue title="index.vue"
<script setup lang="ts">
import { authClient } from "~/lib/client"
const session = authClient.useSession()
</script>

<template>
    <div>
        <button v-if="!session?.data" @click="() => authClient.signIn.social({
            provider: 'github'
        })">
            Continue with GitHub
        </button>
        <div>
            <pre>{{ session.data }}</pre>
            <button v-if="session.data" @click="authClient.signOut()">
                Sign out
            </button>
        </div>
    </div>
</template>
```

### Server Usage

The `api` object exported from the auth instance contains all the actions that you can perform on the server. Every endpoint made inside Better Auth is a invocable as a function. Including plugins endpoints.

**Example: Getting Session on a server API route**

```tsx title="server/api/example.ts"
import { auth } from "~/lib/auth";

export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
    const session = await auth.api.getSession({
      headers: event.headers
    });

   if(session) {
     // access the session.session && session.user
   }
});
```


### SSR Usage

If you are using Nuxt with SSR, you can use the `useSession` function in the `setup` function of your page component and pass `useFetch` to make it work with SSR.

```vue title="index.vue"
<script setup lang="ts">
import { authClient } from "~/lib/auth-client";

const { data: session } = await authClient.useSession(useFetch);
</script>

<template>
    <p>
        {{ session }}
    </p>
</template>
```


### Middleware

To add middleware to your Nuxt project, you can use the `useSession` method from the client.

```ts title="middleware/auth.global.ts"
import { authClient } from "~/lib/auth-client";
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware(async (to, from) => {
	const { data: session } = await authClient.useSession(useFetch); 
	if (!session.value) {
		if (to.path === "/dashboard") {
			return navigateTo("/");
		}
	}
});
```

title: Remix Integration
description: Integrate Better Auth with Remix.
---

Better Auth can be easily integrated with Remix. This guide will show you how to integrate Better Auth with Remix.

You can follow the steps from [installation](/docs/installation) to get started or you can follow this guide to make it the Remix-way.

If you have followed the installation steps, you can skip the first step.

## Create auth instance


Create a file named `auth.server.ts` in one of these locations:
   - Project root
   - `lib/` folder
   - `utils/` folder

You can also nest any of these folders under `app/` folder. (e.g. `app/lib/auth.server.ts`)

And in this file, import Better Auth and create your instance.

<Callout type="warn">
Make sure to export the auth instance with the variable name `auth` or as a `default` export.
</Callout>

```ts title="app/lib/auth.server.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    database: {
        provider: "postgres", //change this to your database provider
        url: process.env.DATABASE_URL, // path to your database or connection string
    }
})
```

## Create API Route

We need to mount the handler to a API route. Create a resource route file `api.auth.$.ts` inside `app/routes/` directory. And add the following code:

```ts title="app/routes/api.auth.$.ts"
import { auth } from '~/lib/auth.server' // Adjust the path as necessary
import type { LoaderFunctionArgs, ActionFunctionArgs } from "@remix-run/node"

export async function loader({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {
    return auth.handler(request)
}

export async function action({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) {
    return auth.handler(request)
}
```

<Callout type="info">
 You can change the path on your better-auth configuration but it's recommended to keep it as `routes/api.auth.$.ts`
</Callout>

## Create a client

Create a client instance. Here we are creating `auth-client.ts` file inside the `lib/` directory.

```ts title="app/lib/auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react" // make sure to import from better-auth/react

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
    //you can pass client configuration here
})
```

Once you have created the client, you can use it to sign up, sign in, and perform other actions.

### Example usage

#### Sign Up

```ts title="app/routes/signup.tsx"
import { Form } from "@remix-run/react"
import { useState } from "react"
import { authClient } from "~/lib/auth.client"

export default function SignUp() {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("")
  const [name, setName] = useState("")
  const [password, setPassword] = useState("")

  const signUp = async () => {
    await authClient.signUp.email(
      {
        email,
        password,
        name,
      },
      {
        onRequest: (ctx) => {
          // show loading state
        },
        onSuccess: (ctx) => {
          // redirect to home

import { useState } from "react"
import { authClient } from "~/services/auth.client"

export default function SignIn() {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("")
  const [password, setPassword] = useState("")

description: Integrate Better Auth with SolidStart.

Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Mount the handler

We need to mount the handler to SolidStart server. Put the following code in your `*auth.ts` file inside `/routes/api/auth` folder.

```ts title="*auth.ts"
import { auth } from "~/lib/auth";
import { toSolidStartHandler } from "better-auth/solid-start";

export const { GET, POST } = toSolidStartHandler(auth);
```
</file>

<file path="docs/better-auth/integrations/svelte-kit.mdx">
---
title: SvelteKit Integration
description: Integrate Better Auth with SvelteKit.
---

Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Mount the handler

We need to mount the handler to SvelteKit server hook.

```ts title="hooks.server.ts"
import { auth } from "$lib/auth";
import { svelteKitHandler } from "better-auth/svelte-kit";
import { building } from "$app/environment";

export async function handle({ event, resolve }) {
  return svelteKitHandler({ event, resolve, auth, building });
}
```

### Server Action Cookies

To ensure cookies are properly set when you call functions like `signInEmail` or `signUpEmail` in a server action, you should use the `sveltekitCookies` plugin. This plugin will automatically handle setting cookies for you in SvelteKit.

You need to add it as a plugin to your Better Auth instance.

<Callout>
  The `getRequestEvent` function is available in SvelteKit `2.2.0` and later.
  Make sure you are using a compatible version.
</Callout>

```ts title="lib/auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { sveltekitCookies } from "better-auth/svelte-kit";
import { getRequestEvent } from "$app/server";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  // ... your config
  plugins: [sveltekitCookies(getRequestEvent)],
});
```

## Create a client

Create a client instance. You can name the file anything you want. Here we are creating `client.ts` file inside the `lib/` directory.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/svelte"; // make sure to import from better-auth/svelte

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
  // you can pass client configuration here
});
```

Once you have created the client, you can use it to sign up, sign in, and perform other actions.
Some of the actions are reactive. The client use [nano-store](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) to store the state and reflect changes when there is a change like a user signing in or out affecting the session state.

### Example usage

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { authClient } from "$lib/client";
  const session = authClient.useSession();
</script>
    <div>
      {#if $session.data}
        <div>
          <p>
            {$session?.data?.user.name}
          </p>
          <button
            on:click={async () => {
              await authClient.signOut();
            }}
          >
            Sign Out
          </button>
        </div>
      {:else}
        <button
          on:click={async () => {
            await authClient.signIn.social({
              provider: "github",
            });
          }}
        >
          Continue with GitHub
        </button>
      {/if}
    </div>
```
</file>

<file path="docs/better-auth/integrations/tanstack.mdx">
---
title: TanStack Start Integration
description: Integrate Better Auth with TanStack Start.
---

This integration guide is assuming you are using TanStack Start.

Before you start, make sure you have a Better Auth instance configured. If you haven't done that yet, check out the [installation](/docs/installation).

### Mount the handler

We need to mount the handler to a TanStack API endpoint/Server Route.
Create a new file: `/src/routes/api/auth/$.ts`

```ts title="src/routes/api/auth/$.ts"
import { auth } from '@/lib/auth' // import your auth instance
import { createServerFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-start/server'

export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute('/api/auth/$').methods({
  GET: ({ request }) => {
    return auth.handler(request)
  },
  POST: ({ request }) => {
    return auth.handler(request)
  },
})
```

If you haven't created your server route handler yet, you can do so by creating a file: `/src/server.ts`

```ts title="src/server.ts"
import {
  createStartHandler,
  defaultStreamHandler,
} from '@tanstack/react-start/server'
import { createRouter } from './router'

export default createStartHandler({
  createRouter,
})(defaultStreamHandler)
```

### Usage tips

- We recommend using the client SDK or `authClient` to handle authentication, rather than server actions with `auth.api`.
- When you call functions that need to set cookies (like `signInEmail` or `signUpEmail`), you'll need to handle cookie setting for TanStack Start. Better Auth provides a `reactStartCookies` plugin to automatically handle this for you.

```ts title="src/lib/auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { reactStartCookies } from "better-auth/react-start";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    //...your config
    plugins: [reactStartCookies()] // make sure this is the last plugin in the array
})
```

Now, when you call functions that set cookies, they will be automatically set using TanStack Start's cookie handling system.

```ts
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth"

const signIn = async () => {
    await auth.api.signInEmail({
        body: {
            email: "user@email.com",
            password: "password",
        }
    })
}
```

title: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
description: Enhance your app's security with two-factor authentication.

`OTP` `TOTP` `Backup Codes` `Trusted Devices`

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra security step when users log in. Instead of just using a password, they'll need to provide a second form of verification. This makes it much harder for unauthorized people to access accounts, even if they've somehow gotten the password.

This plugin offers two main methods to do a second factor verification:

1. **OTP (One-Time Password)**: A temporary code sent to the user's email or phone.
2. **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)**: A code generated by an app on the user's device.

**Additional features include:**
- Generating backup codes for account recovery
- Enabling/disabling 2FA
- Managing trusted devices

## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Add the plugin to your auth config

        Add the two-factor plugin to your auth configuration and specify your app name as the issuer.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { twoFactor } from "better-auth/plugins" // [!code highlight]

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            // ... other config options
            appName: "My App", // provide your app name. It'll be used as an issuer. // [!code highlight]
            plugins: [
                twoFactor() // [!code highlight]
            ]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
      <Step>
        ### Migrate the database

        Run the migration or generate the schema to add the necessary fields and tables to the database.

        <Tabs items={["migrate", "generate"]}>
            <Tab value="migrate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli migrate
            ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="generate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli generate
            ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
        See the [Schema](#schema) section to add the fields manually.
    </Step>

        <Step>
        ### Add the client plugin

        Add the client plugin and Specify where the user should be redirected if they need to verify 2nd factor

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        import { twoFactorClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

        export const authClient = createAuthClient({
            plugins: [
                twoFactorClient()
            ]
        })
        ```
        </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

### Enabling 2FA

To enable two-factor authentication, call `twoFactor.enable` with the user's password and issuer (optional):

<APIMethod
  path="/two-factor/enable"
  method="POST"
  requireSession
>
```ts
type enableTwoFactor = {
    /**
     * The user's password
     */
    password: string = "secure-password"
    /**
     * An optional custom issuer for the TOTP URI. Defaults to app-name defined in your auth config.
     */
    issuer?: string = "my-app-name"
}
```
</APIMethod>

When 2FA is enabled:
- An encrypted `secret` and `backupCodes` are generated.
- `enable` returns `totpURI` and `backupCodes`.

Note: `twoFactorEnabled` won’t be set to `true` until the user verifies their TOTP code. Learn more about veryifying TOTP [here](#totp). You can skip verification by setting `skipVerificationOnEnable` to true in your plugin config.

<Callout type="warn">
Two Factor can only be enabled for credential accounts at the moment. For social accounts, it's assumed the provider already handles 2FA.
</Callout>

### Sign In with 2FA

When a user with 2FA enabled tries to sign in via email, the response object will contain `twoFactorRedirect` set to `true`. This indicates that the user needs to verify their 2FA code.

You can handle this in the `onSuccess` callback or by providing a `onTwoFactorRedirect` callback in the plugin config.

```ts title="sign-in.tsx"
await authClient.signIn.email({
        email: "user@example.com",
        password: "password123",
    },
    {
        async onSuccess(context) {
            if (context.data.twoFactorRedirect) {
                // Handle the 2FA verification in place
            }
        },
    }
)
```

Using the `onTwoFactorRedirect` config:

```ts title="sign-in.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import { twoFactorClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins";

const authClient = createAuthClient({
    plugins: [
        twoFactorClient({
            onTwoFactorRedirect(){
                // Handle the 2FA verification globally
            },
        }),
    ],
});
```




<Callout type="warn">
**With `auth.api`**

When you call `auth.api.signInEmail` on the server, and the user has 2FA enabled, it will return an object where `twoFactorRedirect` is set to `true`. This behavior isn’t inferred in TypeScript, which can be misleading. You can check using `in` instead to check if `twoFactorRedirect` is set to `true`.

```ts
const response = await auth.api.signInEmail({
	body: {
		email: "test@test.com",
		password: "test",
	},
});

if ("twoFactorRedirect" in response) {
	// Handle the 2FA verification in place
}
```
</Callout>

### Disabling 2FA

To disable two-factor authentication, call `twoFactor.disable` with the user's password:

<APIMethod
  path="/two-factor/disable"
  method="POST"
  requireSession
>
```ts
type disableTwoFactor = {
    /**
     * The user's password
     */
    password: string
}
```
</APIMethod>

### TOTP

TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) is an algorithm that generates a unique password for each login attempt using time as a counter. Every fixed interval (Better Auth defaults to 30 seconds), a new password is generated. This addresses several issues with traditional passwords: they can be forgotten, stolen, or guessed. OTPs solve some of these problems, but their delivery via SMS or email can be unreliable (or even risky, considering it opens new attack vectors).

TOTP, however, generates codes offline, making it both secure and convenient. You just need an authenticator app on your phone.

#### Getting TOTP URI

After enabling 2FA, you can get the TOTP URI to display to the user. This URI is generated by the server using the `secret` and `issuer` and can be used to generate a QR code for the user to scan with their authenticator app.

<APIMethod
  path="/two-factor/get-totp-uri"
  method="POST"
  requireSession
>
```ts
type getTOTPURI = {
    /**
     * The user's password
     */
    password: string
}
```
</APIMethod>


**Example: Using React**

Once you have the TOTP URI, you can use it to generate a QR code for the user to scan with their authenticator app.

```tsx title="user-card.tsx"
import QRCode from "react-qr-code";

export default function UserCard({ password }: { password: string }){
    const { data: session } = client.useSession();
	const { data: qr } = useQuery({
		queryKey: ["two-factor-qr"],
		queryFn: async () => {
			const res = await authClient.twoFactor.getTotpUri({ password });
			return res.data;
		},
		enabled: !!session?.user.twoFactorEnabled,
	});
    return (
        <QRCode value={qr?.totpURI || ""} />
   )
}
```

<Callout>
By default the issuer for TOTP is set to the app name provided in the auth config or if not provided it will be set to `Better Auth`. You can override this by passing `issuer` to the plugin config.
</Callout>

#### Verifying TOTP

After the user has entered their 2FA code, you can verify it using `twoFactor.verifyTotp` method.

<APIMethod path="/two-factor/verify-totp" method="POST">
```ts
type verifyTOTP = {
    /**
     * The otp code to verify. 
     */
    code: string = "012345"
    /**
     * If true, the device will be trusted for 30 days. It'll be refreshed on every sign in request within this time. 
     */
    trustDevice?: boolean = true
}
```
</APIMethod>

### OTP

OTP (One-Time Password) is similar to TOTP but a random code is generated and sent to the user's email or phone.

Before using OTP to verify the second factor, you need to configure `sendOTP` in your Better Auth instance. This function is responsible for sending the OTP to the user's email, phone, or any other method supported by your application.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { twoFactor } from "better-auth/plugins"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        twoFactor({
          	otpOptions: {
				async sendOTP({ user, otp }, request) {
                    // send otp to user
				},
			},
        })
    ]
})
```

#### Sending OTP

Sending an OTP is done by calling the `twoFactor.sendOtp` function. This function will trigger your sendOTP implementation that you provided in the Better Auth configuration.

<APIMethod path="/two-factor/send-otp" method="POST">
```ts
type send2FaOTP = {
    /**
     * If true, the device will be trusted for 30 days. It'll be refreshed on every sign in request within this time. 
     */
    trustDevice?: boolean = true
}

if (data) {
    // redirect or show the user to enter the code
}
```
</APIMethod>

#### Verifying OTP

After the user has entered their OTP code, you can verify it

<APIMethod path="/two-factor/verify-otp" method="POST">
```ts
type verifyOTP = {
    /**
     * The otp code to verify. 
     */
    code: string = "012345"
    /**
     * If true, the device will be trusted for 30 days. It'll be refreshed on every sign in request within this time. 
     */
    trustDevice?: boolean = true
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Backup Codes

Backup codes are generated and stored in the database. This can be used to recover access to the account if the user loses access to their phone or email.

#### Generating Backup Codes
Generate backup codes for account recovery:

<APIMethod
  path="/two-factor/generate-backup-codes"
  method="POST"
  requireSession
>
```ts
type generateBackupCodes = {
    /**
     * The users password. 
     */
    password: string
}

if (data) {
    // Show the backup codes to the user
}
```
</APIMethod>


<Callout type="warn">
When you generate backup codes, the old backup codes will be deleted and new ones will be generated.
</Callout>

#### Using Backup Codes

You can now allow users to provider backup code as account recover method.


<APIMethod path="/two-factor/verify-backup-code" method="POST">
```ts
type verifyBackupCode = {
    /**
     * A backup code to verify. 
     */
    code: string = "123456"
    /**
     * If true, the session cookie will not be set. 
     */
    disableSession?: boolean = false
    /**
     * If true, the device will be trusted for 30 days. It'll be refreshed on every sign in request within this time. 
     */
    trustDevice?: boolean = true
}
```
</APIMethod>

<Callout>
Once a backup code is used, it will be removed from the database and can't be used again.
</Callout>

#### Viewing Backup Codes

To display the backup codes to the user, you can call `viewBackupCodes` on the server. This will return the backup codes in the response. You should only this if the user has a fresh session - a session that was just created.

<APIMethod
  path="/two-factor/view-backup-codes"
  method="GET"
  isServerOnly
  forceAsBody
>
```ts
type viewBackupCodes = {
    /**
     * The user ID to view all backup codes. 
     */
    userId?: string | null = "user-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Trusted Devices

You can mark a device as trusted by passing `trustDevice` to `verifyTotp` or `verifyOtp`.

```ts
const verify2FA = async (code: string) => {
    const { data, error } = await authClient.twoFactor.verifyTotp({
        code,
        callbackURL: "/dashboard",
        trustDevice: true // Mark this device as trusted
    })
    if (data) {
        // 2FA verified and device trusted
    }
}
```

When `trustDevice` is set to `true`, the current device will be remembered for 60 days. During this period, the user won't be prompted for 2FA on subsequent sign-ins from this device. The trust period is refreshed each time the user signs in successfully.

### Issuer

By adding an `issuer` you can set your application name for the 2fa application.

For example, if your user uses Google Auth, the default appName will show up as `Better Auth`. However, by using the following code, it will show up as `my-app-name`.

```ts
twoFactor({
    issuer: "my-app-name" // [!code highlight]
})
```
---

## Schema

The plugin requires 1 additional fields in the `user` table and 1 additional table to store the two factor authentication data.

<DatabaseTable
    fields={[
        { name: "twoFactorEnabled", type: "boolean", description: "Whether two factor authentication is enabled for the user.", isOptional: true },
    ]}
/>

Table: `twoFactor`

<DatabaseTable
    fields={[
        { name: "id", type: "string", description: "The ID of the two factor authentication.", isPrimaryKey: true },
        { name: "userId", type: "string", description: "The ID of the user", isForeignKey: true },
        { name: "secret", type: "string", description: "The secret used to generate the TOTP code.", isOptional: true },
        { name: "backupCodes", type: "string", description: "The backup codes used to recover access to the account if the user loses access to their phone or email.", isOptional: true },
    ]}
/>

  }}
  />

**Backup Code Options**

backup codes are generated and stored in the database when the user enabled two factor authentication. This can be used to recover access to the account if the user loses access to their phone or email.

<TypeTable
    type={{
        amount: {
            description: "The amount of backup codes to generate",
            type: "number",
            default: 10,
        },
        length: {
            description: "The length of the backup codes",
            type: "number",
            default: 10,
        },
        customBackupCodesGenerate: {
            description: "A function that generates custom backup codes. It takes no parameters and returns an array of strings.",
            type: "function",
        },
        storeBackupCodes: {
            description: "How to store the backup codes in the database. Whether to store it as plain text or encrypted. You can also provide a custom encryptor.",
            type: "string",
            default: "plain",
        },
    }}
/>

### Client

To use the two factor plugin in the client, you need to add it on your plugins list.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
import { twoFactorClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

const authClient =  createAuthClient({
    plugins: [
        twoFactorClient({ // [!code highlight]
            onTwoFactorRedirect(){ // [!code highlight]
                window.location.href = "/2fa" // Handle the 2FA verification redirect // [!code highlight]
            } // [!code highlight]
        }) // [!code highlight]
    ]
})
```


**Options**

`onTwoFactorRedirect`: A callback that will be called when the user needs to verify their 2FA code. This can be used to redirect the user to the 2FA page.

title: Admin
description: Admin plugin for Better Auth
---

The Admin plugin provides a set of administrative functions for user management in your application. It allows administrators to perform various operations such as creating users, managing user roles, banning/unbanning users, impersonating users, and more.

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Add the plugin to your auth config

    To use the Admin plugin, add it to your auth config.

    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
    import { admin } from "better-auth/plugins" // [!code highlight]

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        // ... other config options
        plugins: [
            admin() // [!code highlight]
        ]
    })
    ```

  </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Migrate the database

        Run the migration or generate the schema to add the necessary fields and tables to the database.

        <Tabs items={["migrate", "generate"]}>
            <Tab value="migrate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli migrate
            ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="generate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli generate
            ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
        See the [Schema](#schema) section to add the fields manually.
    </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add the client plugin

    Next, include the admin client plugin in your authentication client instance.

    ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
    import { adminClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

    export const authClient = createAuthClient({
        plugins: [
            adminClient()
        ]
    })
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

Before performing any admin operations, the user must be authenticated with an admin account. An admin is any user assigned the `admin` role or any user whose ID is included in the `adminUserIds` option.

### Create User

Allows an admin to create a new user.

<APIMethod
  path="/admin/create-user"
  method="POST"
  resultVariable="newUser"
>
```ts
type createUser = {
    /**
     * The email of the user. 
     */
    email: string = "user@example.com"
    /**
     * The password of the user. 
     */
    password: string = "some-secure-password"
    /**
     * The name of the user. 
     */
    name: string = "James Smith"
    /**
     * A string or array of strings representing the roles to apply to the new user. 
     */
    role?: string | string[] = "user"
    /**
     * Extra fields for the user. Including custom additional fields. 
     */
    data?: Record<string, any> = { customField: "customValue" }
}
```
</APIMethod>

### List Users

Allows an admin to list all users in the database.

<APIMethod
  path="/admin/list-users"
  method="GET"
  requireSession
  note={"All properties are optional to configure. By default, 100 rows are returned, you can configure this by the `limit` property."}
  resultVariable={"users"}
>
```ts
type listUsers = {
    /**
     * The value to search for. 
     */
    searchValue?: string = "some name"
    /**
     * The field to search in, defaults to email. Can be `email` or `name`. 
     */
    searchField?: "email" | "name" = "name"
    /**
     * The operator to use for the search. Can be `contains`, `starts_with` or `ends_with`. 
     */
    searchOperator?: "contains" | "starts_with" | "ends_with" = "contains"
    /**
     * The number of users to return. Defaults to 100.
     */
    limit?: string | number = 100
    /**
     * The offset to start from. 
     */
    offset?: string | number = 100
    /**
     * The field to sort by. 
     */
    sortBy?: string = "name"
    /**
     * The direction to sort by. 
     */
    sortDirection?: "asc" | "desc" = "desc"
    /**
     * The field to filter by. 
     */
    filterField?: string = "email"
    /**
     * The value to filter by. 
     */
    filterValue?: string | number | boolean = "hello@example.com"
    /**
     * The operator to use for the filter. 
     */
    filterOperator?: "eq" | "ne" | "lt" | "lte" | "gt" | "gte" = "eq"
}
```
</APIMethod>


#### Query Filtering

The `listUsers` function supports various filter operators including `eq`, `contains`, `starts_with`, and `ends_with`.

#### Pagination

The `listUsers` function supports pagination by returning metadata alongside the user list. The response includes the following fields:

```ts
{
  users: User[],   // Array of returned users
  total: number,   // Total number of users after filters and search queries
  limit: number | undefined,   // The limit provided in the query
  offset: number | undefined   // The offset provided in the query
}
```

##### How to Implement Pagination

To paginate results, use the `total`, `limit`, and `offset` values to calculate:

- **Total pages:** `Math.ceil(total / limit)`
- **Current page:** `(offset / limit) + 1`
- **Next page offset:** `Math.min(offset + limit, (total - 1))` – The value to use as `offset` for the next page, ensuring it does not exceed the total number of pages.
- **Previous page offset:** `Math.max(0, offset - limit)` – The value to use as `offset` for the previous page (ensuring it doesn’t go below zero).

##### Example Usage

Fetching the second page with 10 users per page:

```ts title="admin.ts"
const pageSize = 10;
const currentPage = 2;

const users = await authClient.admin.listUsers({
    query: {
        limit: pageSize,
        offset: (currentPage - 1) * pageSize
    }
});

const totalUsers = users.total;
const totalPages = Math.ceil(totalUsers / limit)
```

    userId: string = "user-id"
    /**
     * The reason for the ban. 
     */
    banReason?: string = "Spamming"
    /**
     * The number of seconds until the ban expires. If not provided, the ban will never expire. 
     */
    banExpiresIn?: number = 60 * 60 * 24 * 7
}
```

     */
    userId: string = "user-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

## Access Control

The admin plugin offers a highly flexible access control system, allowing you to manage user permissions based on their role. You can define custom permission sets to fit your needs.

### Roles

By default, there are two roles:

`admin`: Users with the admin role have full control over other users.

`user`: Users with the user role have no control over other users.

<Callout>
  A user can have multiple roles. Multiple roles are stored as string separated by comma (",").
</Callout>

### Permissions

By default, there are two resources with up to six permissions.

**user**:
  `create` `list` `set-role` `ban` `impersonate` `delete` `set-password`

**session**:
  `list` `revoke` `delete`

Users with the admin role have full control over all the resources and actions. Users with the user role have no control over any of those actions.

### Custom Permissions

The plugin provides an easy way to define your own set of permissions for each role.

<Steps>
    <Step>
    #### Create Access Control

    You first need to create an access controller by calling the `createAccessControl` function and passing the statement object. The statement object should have the resource name as the key and the array of actions as the value.
    ```ts title="permissions.ts"
    import { createAccessControl } from "better-auth/plugins/access";

    /**
     * make sure to use `as const` so typescript can infer the type correctly
     */
    const statement = { // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create", "share", "update", "delete"], // [!code highlight]
    } as const; // [!code highlight]

    const ac = createAccessControl(statement); // [!code highlight]
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
    #### Create Roles

    Once you have created the access controller you can create roles with the permissions you have defined.

    ```ts title="permissions.ts"
    import { createAccessControl } from "better-auth/plugins/access";

    export const statement = {
        project: ["create", "share", "update", "delete"], // <-- Permissions available for created roles
    } as const;

    const ac = createAccessControl(statement);

    export const user = ac.newRole({ // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create"], // [!code highlight]
    }); // [!code highlight]

   export const admin = ac.newRole({ // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create", "update"], // [!code highlight]
    }); // [!code highlight]

    export const myCustomRole = ac.newRole({ // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create", "update", "delete"], // [!code highlight]
        user: ["ban"], // [!code highlight]
    }); // [!code highlight]
    ```

      When you create custom roles for existing roles, the predefined permissions for those roles will be overridden. To add the existing permissions to the custom role, you need to import `defaultStatements` and merge it with your new statement, plus merge the roles' permissions set with the default roles.

    ```ts title="permissions.ts"
    import { createAccessControl } from "better-auth/plugins/access";
    import { defaultStatements, adminAc } from "better-auth/plugins/admin/access";

    const statement = {
        ...defaultStatements, // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create", "share", "update", "delete"],
    } as const;

    const ac = createAccessControl(statement);

    const admin = ac.newRole({
        project: ["create", "update"],
        ...adminAc.statements, // [!code highlight]
    });
    ```

    </Step>

    <Step>
        #### Pass Roles to the Plugin

        Once you have created the roles you can pass them to the admin plugin both on the client and the server.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { admin as adminPlugin } from "better-auth/plugins"
        import { ac, admin, user } from "@/auth/permissions"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            plugins: [
                adminPlugin({
                    ac,
                    roles: {
                        admin,
                        user,
                        myCustomRole
                    }
                }),
            ],
        });
        ```

        You also need to pass the access controller and the roles to the client plugin.

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        import { adminClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
        import { ac, admin, user, myCustomRole } from "@/auth/permissions"

        export const client = createAuthClient({
            plugins: [
                adminClient({
                    ac,
                    roles: {
                        admin,
                        user,
                        myCustomRole
                    }
                })
            ]
        })
        ```
    </Step>

</Steps>

### Access Control Usage

**Has Permission**:

To check a user's permissions, you can use the `hasPermission` function provided by the client.


<APIMethod path="/admin/has-permission" method="POST">
```ts
type userHasPermission = {
    /**
     * The user id which you want to check the permissions for. 
     */
    userId?: string = "user-id"
    /**
     * Check role permissions.
     * @serverOnly
     */
    role?: string = "admin"
    /**
     * Optionally check if a single permission is granted. Must use this, or permissions. 
     */
    permission?: Record<string, string[]> = { "project": ["create", "update"] } /* Must use this, or permissions */,
    /**
     * Optionally check if multiple permissions are granted. Must use this, or permission. 
     */
    permissions?: Record<string, string[]>
}
```
</APIMethod>

Example usage:

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const canCreateProject = await authClient.admin.hasPermission({
  permissions: {
    project: ["create"],
  },
});

// You can also check multiple resource permissions at the same time
const canCreateProjectAndCreateSale = await authClient.admin.hasPermission({
  permissions: {
    project: ["create"],
    sale: ["create"]
  },
});
```

If you want to check a user's permissions server-side, you can use the `userHasPermission` action provided by the `api` to check the user's permissions.



```ts title="api.ts"
import { auth } from "@/auth";

await auth.api.userHasPermission({
  body: {
    userId: 'id', //the user id
    permissions: {
      project: ["create"], // This must match the structure in your access control
    },
  },
});

// You can also just pass the role directly
await auth.api.userHasPermission({
  body: {
   role: "admin",
    permissions: {
      project: ["create"], // This must match the structure in your access control
    },
  },
});

// You can also check multiple resource permissions at the same time
await auth.api.userHasPermission({
  body: {
   role: "admin",
    permissions: {
      project: ["create"], // This must match the structure in your access control
      sale: ["create"]
    },
  },
});
```


**Check Role Permission**:

Use the `checkRolePermission` function on the client side to verify whether a given **role** has a specific **permission**. This is helpful after defining roles and their permissions, as it allows you to perform permission checks without needing to contact the server.

Note that this function does **not** check the permissions of the currently logged-in user directly. Instead, it checks what permissions are assigned to a specified role. The function is synchronous, so you don't need to use `await` when calling it.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const canCreateProject = authClient.admin.checkRolePermission({
  permissions: {
    user: ["delete"],
  },
  role: "admin",
});

// You can also check multiple resource permissions at the same time
const canDeleteUserAndRevokeSession = authClient.admin.checkRolePermission({
  permissions: {
    user: ["delete"],
    session: ["revoke"]
  },
  role: "admin",
});
```

## Schema

This plugin adds the following fields to the `user` table:

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    {
      name: "role",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "The user's role. Defaults to `user`. Admins will have the `admin` role.",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "banned",
      type: "boolean",
      description: "Indicates whether the user is banned.",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "banReason",
      type: "string",
      description: "The reason for the user's ban.",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "banExpires",
      type: "date",
      description: "The date when the user's ban will expire.",
      isOptional: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

And adds one field in the `session` table:

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    {
      name: "impersonatedBy",
      type: "string",
      description: "The ID of the admin that is impersonating this session.",
      isOptional: true,
    },
  ]}

    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
    import { anonymous } from "better-auth/plugins" // [!code highlight]
    
    export const auth = betterAuth({
        // ... other config options
        plugins: [
            anonymous() // [!code highlight]
        ]
    })
    ```
  </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Migrate the database

        Run the migration or generate the schema to add the necessary fields and tables to the database.

        <Tabs items={["migrate", "generate"]}>
            <Tab value="migrate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli migrate
            ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="generate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli generate
            ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
        See the [Schema](#schema) section to add the fields manually.
    </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add the client plugin

    Next, include the anonymous client plugin in your authentication client instance.

    ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
    import { anonymousClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
    
    export const authClient = createAuthClient({
        plugins: [
            anonymousClient()
        ]
    })
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

### Sign In

To sign in a user anonymously, use the `signIn.anonymous()` method.

```ts title="example.ts"
const user = await authClient.signIn.anonymous()
```

### Link Account

If a user is already signed in anonymously and tries to `signIn` or `signUp` with another method, their anonymous activities can be linked to the new account.

To do that you first need to provide `onLinkAccount` callback to the plugin.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        anonymous({
            onLinkAccount: async ({ anonymousUser, newUser }) => {
               // perform actions like moving the cart items from anonymous user to the new user
            }
        })
    ]
```

Then when you call `signIn` or `signUp` with another method, the `onLinkAccount` callback will be called. And the `anonymousUser` will be deleted by default.

```ts title="example.ts"
const user = await authClient.signIn.email({
    email,
})
```

## Options

- `emailDomainName`: The domain name to use when generating an email address for anonymous users. Defaults to the domain name of the current site.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        anonymous({
            emailDomainName: "example.com"
        })
    ]
})
```

- `onLinkAccount`: A callback function that is called when an anonymous user links their account to a new authentication method. The callback receives an object with the `anonymousUser` and the `newUser`.

- `disableDeleteAnonymousUser`: By default, the anonymous user is deleted when the account is linked to a new authentication method. Set this option to `true` to disable this behavior.

- `generateName`: A callback function that is called to generate a name for the anonymous user. Useful if you want to have random names for anonymous users, or if `name` is unique in your database.

## Schema

The anonymous plugin requires an additional field in the user table:

<DatabaseTable
    fields={[
        { name: "isAnonymous", type: "boolean", description: "Indicates whether the user is anonymous.", isOptional: true },
    ]}
/>
</file>

}
```
</APIMethod>

#### Result

If fails, throws `APIError`.
Otherwise, you'll receive the API Key details, except for the `key` value itself.

---

### Delete an API Key

<APIMethod
  path="/api-key/delete"
  method="POST"
  requireSession
  note="This endpoint is attempting to delete the API key from the perspective of the user. It will check if the user's ID matches the key owner to be able to delete it. If you want to delete a key without these checks, we recommend you use an ORM to directly mutate your DB instead."
>
```ts
type deleteApiKey = {
    /**
     * The id of the Api Key to delete. 
     */
    keyId: string = "some-api-key-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

#### Result

If fails, throws `APIError`.
Otherwise, you'll receive:

```ts
type Result = {
  success: boolean;
};
```

---

### List API keys

<APIMethod
  path="/api-key/list"
  method="GET"
  requireSession
>
```ts
type listApiKeys = {
}
```
</APIMethod>

#### Result

If fails, throws `APIError`.
Otherwise, you'll receive:

```ts
type Result = ApiKey[];
```

---

### Delete all expired API keys

This function will delete all API keys that have an expired expiration date.

<APIMethod
  path="/api-key/delete-all-expired-api-keys"
  method="POST"
  isServerOnly
>
```ts
type deleteAllExpiredApiKeys = {
}
```
</APIMethod>

<Callout>
  We automatically delete expired API keys every time any apiKey plugin
  endpoints were called, however they are rate-limited to a 10 second cool down
  each call to prevent multiple calls to the database.
</Callout>

---

## Sessions from API keys

Any time an endpoint in Better Auth is called that has a valid API key in the headers, we will automatically create a mock session to represent the user.

<Tabs items={['Server']}>
    <Tab value="Server">
      ```ts
      const session = await auth.api.getSession({
            headers: new Headers({
                  'x-api-key': apiKey,
            }),
      });
      ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>


The default header key is `x-api-key`, but this can be changed by setting the `apiKeyHeaders` option in the plugin options.

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    apiKey({
      apiKeyHeaders: ["x-api-key", "xyz-api-key"], // or you can pass just a string, eg: "x-api-key"
    }),
  ],
});
```

Or optionally, you can pass an `apiKeyGetter` function to the plugin options, which will be called with the `GenericEndpointContext`, and from there, you should return the API key, or `null` if the request is invalid.

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    apiKey({
      apiKeyGetter: (ctx) => {
        const has = ctx.request.headers.has("x-api-key");
        if (!has) return null;
        return ctx.request.headers.get("x-api-key");
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Rate Limiting

Every API key can have its own rate limit settings, however, the built-in rate-limiting only applies to the verification process for a given API key.
For every other endpoint/method, you should utilize Better Auth's [built-in rate-limiting](/docs/concepts/rate-limit).

You can refer to the rate-limit default configurations below in the API Key plugin options.

An example default value:

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    apiKey({
      rateLimit: {
        enabled: true,
        timeWindow: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24, // 1 day
        maxRequests: 10, // 10 requests per day
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

For each API key, you can customize the rate-limit options on create.

<Callout>
  You can only customize the rate-limit options on the server auth instance.
</Callout>

```ts
const apiKey = await auth.api.createApiKey({
  body: {
    rateLimitEnabled: true,
    rateLimitTimeWindow: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24, // 1 day
    rateLimitMax: 10, // 10 requests per day
  },
  headers: user_headers,
});
```

### How does it work?

For each request, a counter (internally called `requestCount`) is incremented.  
If the `rateLimitMax` is reached, the request will be rejected until the `timeWindow` has passed, at which point the `timeWindow` will be reset.

## Remaining, refill, and expiration

The remaining count is the number of requests left before the API key is disabled.  
The refill interval is the interval in milliseconds where the `remaining` count is refilled by day.  
The expiration time is the expiration date of the API key.

### How does it work?

#### Remaining:

Whenever an API key is used, the `remaining` count is updated.  
If the `remaining` count is `null`, then there is no cap to key usage.  
Otherwise, the `remaining` count is decremented by 1.  
If the `remaining` count is 0, then the API key is disabled & removed.

#### refillInterval & refillAmount:

Whenever an API key is created, the `refillInterval` and `refillAmount` are set to `null`.  
This means that the API key will not be refilled automatically.  
However, if `refillInterval` & `refillAmount` are set, then the API key will be refilled accordingly.

#### Expiration:

Whenever an API key is created, the `expiresAt` is set to `null`.  
This means that the API key will never expire.  
However, if the `expiresIn` is set, then the API key will expire after the `expiresIn` time.

## Custom Key generation & verification

You can customize the key generation and verification process straight from the plugin options.

Here's an example:

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    apiKey({
      customKeyGenerator: (options: {
        length: number;
        prefix: string | undefined;
      }) => {
        const apiKey = mySuperSecretApiKeyGenerator(
          options.length,
          options.prefix
        );
        return apiKey;
      },
      customAPIKeyValidator: async ({ ctx, key }) => {
        const res = await keyService.verify(key)
        return res.valid
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

<Callout>
If you're **not** using the `length` property provided by `customKeyGenerator`, you **must** set the `defaultKeyLength` property to how long generated keys will be.

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    apiKey({
      customKeyGenerator: () => {
        return crypto.randomUUID();
      },
      defaultKeyLength: 36, // Or whatever the length is
    }),
  ],
});
```

</Callout>

If an API key is validated from your `customAPIKeyValidator`, we still must match that against the database's key.
However, by providing this custom function, you can improve the performance of the API key verification process,
as all failed keys can be invalidated without having to query your database.

## Metadata

We allow you to store metadata alongside your API keys. This is useful for storing information about the key, such as a subscription plan for example.

To store metadata, make sure you haven't disabled the metadata feature in the plugin options.

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    apiKey({
      enableMetadata: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```

Then, you can store metadata in the `metadata` field of the API key object.

```ts
const apiKey = await auth.api.createApiKey({
  body: {
    metadata: {
      plan: "premium",
    },
  },
});
```

You can then retrieve the metadata from the API key object.

```ts
const apiKey = await auth.api.getApiKey({
  body: {
    keyId: "your_api_key_id_here",
  },
});

console.log(apiKey.metadata.plan); // "premium"
```

## Permissions

API keys can have permissions associated with them, allowing you to control access at a granular level. Permissions are structured as a record of resource types to arrays of allowed actions.

### Setting Default Permissions

You can configure default permissions that will be applied to all newly created API keys:

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    apiKey({
      permissions: {
        defaultPermissions: {
          files: ["read"],
          users: ["read"],
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

You can also provide a function that returns permissions dynamically:

```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    apiKey({
      permissions: {
        defaultPermissions: async (userId, ctx) => {
          // Fetch user role or other data to determine permissions
          return {
            files: ["read"],
            users: ["read"],
          };
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Creating API Keys with Permissions

When creating an API key, you can specify custom permissions:

```ts
const apiKey = await auth.api.createApiKey({
  body: {
    name: "My API Key",
    permissions: {
      files: ["read", "write"],
      users: ["read"],
    },
    userId: "userId",
  },
});
```

### Verifying API Keys with Required Permissions

When verifying an API key, you can check if it has the required permissions:

```ts
const result = await auth.api.verifyApiKey({
  body: {
    key: "your_api_key_here",
    permissions: {
      files: ["read"],
    },
  },
});

if (result.valid) {
  // API key is valid and has the required permissions
} else {
  // API key is invalid or doesn't have the required permissions
}
```

### Updating API Key Permissions

You can update the permissions of an existing API key:

```ts
const apiKey = await auth.api.updateApiKey({
  body: {
    keyId: existingApiKeyId,
    permissions: {
      files: ["read", "write", "delete"],
      users: ["read", "write"],
    },
  },
  headers: user_headers,
});
```

### Permissions Structure

Permissions follow a resource-based structure:

```ts
type Permissions = {
  [resourceType: string]: string[];
};

// Example:
const permissions = {
  files: ["read", "write", "delete"],
  users: ["read"],
  projects: ["read", "write"],
};
```

When verifying an API key, all required permissions must be present in the API key's permissions for validation to succeed.

import { HomeIcon } from "lucide-react";
import { Accordion, Accordions } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

[Autumn](https://useautumn.com) is open source infrastructure to run SaaS pricing plans. It sits between your app and Stripe, and acts as the database for your customers' subscription status, usage metering and feature permissions.

<Card href="https://discord.gg/STqxY92zuS" title="Get help on Autumn's Discord">
  We're online to help you with any questions you have.
</Card>

## Features

- One function for all checkout, subscription and payment flows
- No webhooks required: query Autumn for the data you need
- Manages your application's free and paid plans
- Usage tracking for usage billing and periodic limits
- Custom plans and pricing changes through Autumn's dashboard


<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Setup Autumn Account
    First, create your pricing plans in Autumn's [dashboard](https://app.useautumn.com), where you define what each plan and product gets access to and how it should be billed. In this example, we're handling the free and pro plans for an AI chatbot, which comes with a number of `messages` per month.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Install Autumn SDK

    ```package-install
    autumn-js
    ```
    <Callout>
      If you're using a separate client and server setup, make sure to install the plugin in both parts of your project.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add `AUTUMN_SECRET_KEY` to your environment variables

    You can find it in Autumn's dashboard under "[Developer](https://app.useautumn.com/sandbox/onboarding)".

    ```bash title=".env"
    AUTUMN_SECRET_KEY=am_sk_xxxxxxxxxx
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add the Autumn plugin to your `auth` config

    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { autumn } from "autumn-js/better-auth";

    export const auth = betterAuth({
      // ...
      plugins: [autumn()],
    });
    ```
  <Callout>
    Autumn will auto-create your customers when they sign up, and assign them any
    default plans you created (eg your Free plan)
  </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
      ### Add `<AutumnProvider />`

      Client side, wrap your application with the AutumnProvider component, and pass in the `baseUrl` that you define within better-auth's `authClient`.

      ```tsx title="app/layout.tsx"
      import { AutumnProvider } from "autumn-js/react";

      export default function RootLayout({
        children,
      }: {
        children: React.ReactNode;
      }) {
        return (
          <html>
            <body>
              {/* or meta.env.BETTER_AUTH_URL for vite */}
              <AutumnProvider betterAuthUrl={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL}>
                {children}
              </AutumnProvider>
            </body>
          </html>
        );
      }
      ```
  </Step>  
</Steps>

## Usage

### Handle payments

Call `attach` to redirect the customer to a Stripe checkout page when they want to purchase the Pro plan.

If their payment method is already on file, `AttachDialog` will open instead to let the customer confirm their new subscription or purchase, and handle the payment.

<Callout type="warn">
  {" "}
  Make sure you've pasted in your [Stripe test secret
  key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) in the [Autumn
  dashboard](https://app.useautumn.com/integrations/stripe).
</Callout>

```tsx
import { useCustomer, AttachDialog } from "autumn-js/react";

export default function PurchaseButton() {
  const { attach } = useCustomer();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={async () => {
        await attach({
          productId: "pro",
          dialog: AttachDialog,
        });
      }}
    >
      Upgrade to Pro
    </button>
  );
}
```

The AttachDialog component can be used directly from the `autumn-js/react`
library (as shown in the example above), or downloaded as a [shadcn/ui component](https://docs.useautumn.com/quickstart/shadcn) to customize.

### Integrate Pricing Logic

Integrate your client and server pricing tiers logic with the following functions:

- `check` to see if the customer is `allowed` to send a message.
- `track` a usage event in Autumn (typically done server-side)
- `customer` to display any relevant billing data in your UI (subscriptions, feature balances)

Server-side, you can access Autumn's functions through the `auth` object.

<Tabs items={["Client", "Server"]}>
<Tab value="Client">

```jsx
import { useCustomer } from "autumn-js/react";

export default function SendChatMessage() {
  const { customer, allowed, refetch } = useCustomer();

  return (
    <>
      <button
        onClick={async () => {
          if (allowed({ featureId: "messages" })) {
            //... send chatbot message server-side, then
            await refetch(); // refetch customer usage data
            alert(
              "Remaining messages: " + customer?.features.messages?.balance
            );
          } else {
            alert("You're out of messages");
          }
        }}
      >
        Send Message
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="Server">

```typescript Server
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth";

// check on the backend if the customer can send a message
const { allowed } = await auth.api.check({
  headers: await headers(), // pass the request headers
  body: {
    feature_id: "messages",
  },
});

// server-side function to send the message

// then track the usage
await auth.api.track({
  headers: await headers(),
  body: {
    feature_id: "messages",
    value: 2,
  },
});
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Additional Functions

#### openBillingPortal()

Opens a billing portal where the customer can update their payment method or cancel their plan.

```tsx
import { useCustomer } from "autumn-js/react";

export default function BillingSettings() {
  const { openBillingPortal } = useCustomer();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={async () => {
        await openBillingPortal({
          returnUrl: "/settings/billing",
        });
      }}
    >
      Manage Billing
    </button>
  );
}
```

#### cancel()

Cancel a product or subscription.

```tsx
import { useCustomer } from "autumn-js/react";

export default function CancelSubscription() {
  const { cancel } = useCustomer();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={async () => {
        await cancel({ productId: "pro" });
      }}
    >
      Cancel Subscription
    </button>
  );
}
```

#### Get invoice history

Pass in an `expand` param into `useCustomer` to get additional information. You can expand `invoices`, `trials_used`, `payment_method`, or `rewards`.

```tsx
import { useCustomer } from "autumn-js/react";

export default function CustomerProfile() {
  const { customer } = useCustomer({ expand: ["invoices"] });

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Customer Profile</h2>
      <p>Name: {customer?.name}</p>
      <p>Email: {customer?.email}</p>
      <p>Balance: {customer?.features.chat_messages?.balance}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<file path="docs/better-auth/plugins/bearer.mdx">
---
title: Bearer Token Authentication
description: Authenticate API requests using Bearer tokens instead of browser cookies
---

The Bearer plugin enables authentication using Bearer tokens as an alternative to browser cookies. It intercepts requests, adding the Bearer token to the Authorization header before forwarding them to your API.

<Callout type="warn">
  Use this cautiously; it is intended only for APIs that don't support cookies or require Bearer tokens for authentication. Improper implementation could easily lead to security vulnerabilities.
</Callout>

## Installing the Bearer Plugin

Add the Bearer plugin to your authentication setup:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { bearer } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [bearer()]
});
```

## How to Use Bearer Tokens

### 1. Obtain the Bearer Token

After a successful sign-in, you'll receive a session token in the response headers. Store this token securely (e.g., in `localStorage`):

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const { data } = await authClient.signIn.email({
    email: "user@example.com",
    password: "securepassword"
}, {
  onSuccess: (ctx)=>{
    const authToken = ctx.response.headers.get("set-auth-token") // get the token from the response headers
    // Store the token securely (e.g., in localStorage)
    localStorage.setItem("bearer_token", authToken);
  }
});
```

You can also set this up globally in your auth client:

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
export const authClient = createAuthClient({
    fetchOptions: {
        onSuccess: (ctx) => {
            const authToken = ctx.response.headers.get("set-auth-token") // get the token from the response headers
            // Store the token securely (e.g., in localStorage)
            if(authToken){
              localStorage.setItem("bearer_token", authToken);
            }
        }
    }
});
```


You may want to clear the token based on the response status code or other conditions:

### 2. Configure the Auth Client

Set up your auth client to include the Bearer token in all requests:

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
export const authClient = createAuthClient({
    fetchOptions: {
        auth: {
           type:"Bearer",
           token: () => localStorage.getItem("bearer_token") || "" // get the token from localStorage
        }
    }
});
```

### 3. Make Authenticated Requests

Now you can make authenticated API calls:

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
// This request is automatically authenticated
const { data } = await authClient.listSessions();
```

### 4. Per-Request Token (Optional)

You can also provide the token for individual requests:

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const { data } = await authClient.listSessions({
    fetchOptions: {
        headers: {
            Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
        }
    }
});
```

### 5. Using Bearer Tokens Outside the Auth Client

The Bearer token can be used to authenticate any request to your API, even when not using the auth client:

```ts title="api-call.ts"
const token = localStorage.getItem("bearer_token");

const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
```

And in the server, you can use the `auth.api.getSession` function to authenticate requests:

```ts title="server.ts"
import { auth } from "@/auth";

export async function handler(req, res) {
  const session = await auth.api.getSession({
    headers: req.headers
  });
  
  if (!session) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
  }
  
  // Process authenticated request
  // ...
}
```


## Options

**requireSignature** (boolean): Require the token to be signed. Default: `false`.

<file path="docs/better-auth/plugins/captcha.mdx">
---
title: Captcha
description: Captcha plugin
---

The **Captcha Plugin** integrates bot protection into your Better Auth system by adding captcha verification for key endpoints. This plugin ensures that only human users can perform actions like signing up, signing in, or resetting passwords. The following providers are currently supported:
- [Google reCAPTCHA](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha)
- [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/turnstile/)
- [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/)

<Callout type="info">
  This plugin works out of the box with <Link href="/docs/authentication/email-password">Email & Password</Link> authentication. To use it with other authentication methods, you will need to configure the <Link href="/docs/plugins/captcha#plugin-options">endpoints</Link> array in the plugin options.
</Callout>

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Add the plugin to your **auth** config

    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
    import { captcha } from "better-auth/plugins";

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
            captcha({ // [!code highlight]
                provider: "cloudflare-turnstile", // or google-recaptcha, hcaptcha // [!code highlight]
                secretKey: process.env.TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY!, // [!code highlight]
            }), // [!code highlight]
        ], // [!code highlight]
    });
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Add the captcha token to your request headers

    Add the captcha token to your request headers for all protected endpoints. This example shows how to include it in a `signIn` request:

    ```ts
    await authClient.signIn.email({
        email: "user@example.com",
        password: "secure-password",
        fetchOptions: { // [!code highlight]
            headers: { // [!code highlight]
                "x-captcha-response": turnstileToken, // [!code highlight]
                "x-captcha-user-remote-ip": userIp, // optional: forwards the user's IP address to the captcha service // [!code highlight]
            }, // [!code highlight]
        }, // [!code highlight]
    });
    ```

    - To implement Cloudflare Turnstile on the client side, follow the official [Cloudflare Turnstile documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/) or use a library like [react-turnstile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@marsidev/react-turnstile).
    - To implement Google reCAPTCHA on the client side, follow the official [Google reCAPTCHA documentation](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/intro) or use libraries like [react-google-recaptcha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-google-recaptcha) (v2) and [react-google-recaptcha-v3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-google-recaptcha-v3) (v3).
    - To implement hCaptcha on the client side, follow the official [hCaptcha documentation](https://docs.hcaptcha.com/#add-the-hcaptcha-widget-to-your-webpage) or use libraries like [@hcaptcha/react-hcaptcha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hcaptcha/react-hcaptcha)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step>
    The plugin acts as a middleware: it intercepts all `POST` requests to configured endpoints (see `endpoints`
    in the [Plugin Options](#plugin-options) section).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    it validates the captcha token on the server, by calling the captcha provider's `/siteverify`.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    - if the token is missing, gets rejected by the captcha provider, or if the `/siteverify` endpoint is
    unavailable, the plugin returns an error and interrupts the request.
    - if the token is accepted by the captcha provider, the middleware returns `undefined`, meaning the request is allowed to proceed.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Plugin Options

- **`provider` (required)**: your captcha provider.
- **`secretKey` (required)**: your provider's secret key used for the server-side validation.
- `endpoints` (optional): overrides the default array of paths where captcha validation is enforced. Default is: `["/sign-up/email", "/sign-in/email", "/forget-password",]`.
- `minScore` (optional - only *Google ReCAPTCHA v3*): minimum score threshold. Default is `0.5`.
- `siteKey` (optional - only *hCaptcha*): prevents tokens issued on one sitekey from being redeemed elsewhere.
- `siteVerifyURLOverride` (optional): overrides endpoint URL for the captcha verification request.

title: Dub
description: Better Auth Plugin for Lead Tracking using Dub links and OAuth Linking
---

[Dub](https://dub.co/) is an open source modern link management platform for entrepreneurs, creators, and growth teams.

This plugins allows you to track leads when a user signs up using a Dub link. It also adds OAuth linking support to allow you to build integrations extending Dub's linking management infrastructure.

## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Install the plugin
        First, install the plugin:

        ```package-install
        @dub/better-auth
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Install the Dub SDK

        Next, install the Dub SDK on your server:

        ```package-install
        dub
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Configure the plugin

        Add the plugin to your auth config:

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { dubAnalytics } from "@dub/better-auth"
        import { dub } from "dub"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            plugins: [
                dubAnalytics({
                    dubClient: new Dub()
                })
            ]
        })
        ```
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Usage

### Lead Tracking

By default, the plugin will track sign up events as leads. You can disable this by setting `disableLeadTracking` to `true`.

```ts
import { dubAnalytics } from "@dub/better-auth";
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { Dub } from "dub";

const dub = new Dub();

const betterAuth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    dubAnalytics({
      dubClient: dub,
      disableLeadTracking: true, // Disable lead tracking
    }),
  ],
});
```

### OAuth Linking

The plugin supports OAuth for account linking.

First, you need to setup OAuth app in Dub. Dub supports OAuth 2.0 authentication, which is recommended if you build integrations extending Dub’s functionality [Learn more about OAuth](https://dub.co/docs/integrations/quickstart#integrating-via-oauth-2-0-recommended).

Once you get the client ID and client secret, you can configure the plugin.

```ts
dubAnalytics({
  dubClient: dub,
  oauth: {
    clientId: "your-client-id",
    clientSecret: "your-client-secret",
  },
});
```

And in the client, you need to use the `dubAnalyticsClient` plugin.

```ts
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import { dubAnalyticsClient } from "@dub/better-auth/client";

const authClient = createAuthClient({
  plugins: [dubAnalyticsClient()],
});
```

To link account with Dub, you need to use the `dub.link`.

<APIMethod path="/dub/link" method="POST" requireSession>
```ts
type dubLink = {
  /**
   * URL to redirect to after linking
   * @clientOnly
  */
  callbackURL: string = "/dashboard"
}
```
</APIMethod>

## Options

You can pass the following options to the plugin:

### `dubClient`

The Dub client instance.

### `disableLeadTracking`

Disable lead tracking for sign up events.

### `leadEventName`

Event name for sign up leads.

### `customLeadTrack`

Custom lead track function.

### `oauth`

Dub OAuth configuration.

### `oauth.clientId`

Client ID for Dub OAuth.

### `oauth.clientSecret`

Client secret for Dub OAuth.

### `oauth.pkce`

Enable PKCE for Dub OAuth.

title: Email OTP
description: Email OTP plugin for Better Auth.
---

The Email OTP plugin allows user to sign in, verify their email, or reset their password using a one-time password (OTP) sent to their email address.


## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Add the plugin to your auth config

    To enable email otp in your app, you need to add the `emailOTP` plugin to your auth config.

    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
    import { emailOTP } from "better-auth/plugins" // [!code highlight]
    
    export const auth = betterAuth({
        // ... other config options
        plugins: [
            emailOTP({ // [!code highlight]
                    async sendVerificationOTP({ email, otp, type}) { // [!code highlight]
						// Implement the sendVerificationOTP method to send the OTP to the user's email address // [!code highlight]
					}, // [!code highlight]
            }) // [!code highlight]
        ]
    })
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### Add the client plugin

    ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
    import { emailOTPClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
    
    export const authClient = createAuthClient({
        plugins: [
            emailOTPClient()
        ]
    })
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

### Send OTP

First, send an OTP to the user's email address.

<APIMethod path="/email-otp/send-verification-otp" method="POST">
```ts
type sendVerificationOTP = {
    /**
     * Email address to send the OTP. 
     */
    email: string = "user@example.com"
    /**
     * Type of the OTP. `sign-in`, `email-verification`, or `forget-password`. 
     */
    type: "email-verification" | "sign-in" | "forget-password" = "sign-in"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Sign in with OTP

Once the user provides the OTP, you can sign in the user using the `signIn.emailOtp()` method.

<APIMethod path="/sign-in/email-otp" method="POST">
```ts
type signInEmailOTP = {
    /**
     * Email address to sign in. 
     */
    email: string = "user@example.com"
    /**
     * OTP sent to the email. 
     */
    otp: string = "123456"
}
```
</APIMethod>

<Callout>
If the user is not registered, they'll be automatically registered. If you want to prevent this, you can pass `disableSignUp` as `true` in the options.
</Callout>

### Verify Email

To verify the user's email address, use the `verifyEmail()` method.

<APIMethod path="/email-otp/verify-email" method="POST">
```ts
type verifyEmailOTP = {
    /**
     * Email address to verify. 
     */
    email: string = "user@example.com"
    /**
     * OTP to verify. 
     */
    otp: string = "123456"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Forgot & Reset Password

To reset the user's password, you must use the `forgotPassword` method:

<APIMethod path="/forget-password/email-otp" method="POST">
```ts
type forgetPasswordEmailOTP = {
    /**
     * Email address to send the OTP. 
     */
    email: string = "user@example.com"
}
```
</APIMethod>


After that, you may use the `resetPassword()` method to apply the password reset.

<APIMethod path="/email-otp/reset-password" method="POST">
```ts
type resetPasswordEmailOTP = {
    /**
     * Email address to reset the password. 
     */
    email: string = "user@example.com"
    /**
     * OTP sent to the email. 
     */
    otp: string = "123456"
    /**
     * New password. 
     */
    password: string = "new-secure-password"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Override Default Email Verification

To override the default email verification, pass `overrideDefaultEmailVerification: true` in the options. This will make the system use an email OTP instead of the default verification link whenever email verification is triggered. In other words, the user will verify their email using an OTP rather than clicking a link.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    emailOTP({
      overrideDefaultEmailVerification: true, // [!code highlight]
      async sendVerificationOTP({ email, otp, type }) {
        // Implement the sendVerificationOTP method to send the OTP to the user's email address
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```


## Options

- `sendVerificationOTP`: A function that sends the OTP to the user's email address. The function receives an object with the following properties:
  - `email`: The user's email address.
  - `otp`: The OTP to send.
  - `type`: The type of OTP to send. Can be "sign-in", "email-verification", or "forget-password".

### Example

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        emailOTP({
            async sendVerificationOTP({
                email,
                otp,
                type
            }) {
                if (type === "sign-in") {
                    // Send the OTP for sign-in
                } else if (type === "email-verification") {
                    // Send the OTP for email verification
                } else {
                    // Send the OTP for password reset
                }
            },
        })
    ]
})
```

- `otpLength`: The length of the OTP. Defaults to `6`.
- `expiresIn`: The expiry time of the OTP in seconds. Defaults to `300` seconds.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        emailOTP({
            otpLength: 8,
            expiresIn: 600
        })
    ]
})
```

- `sendVerificationOnSignUp`: A boolean value that determines whether to send the OTP when a user signs up. Defaults to `false`.

- `disableSignUp`: A boolean value that determines whether to prevent automatic sign-up when the user is not registered. Defaults to `false`.

- `generateOTP`: A function that generates the OTP. Defaults to a random 6-digit number.

- `allowedAttempts`: The maximum number of attempts allowed for verifying an OTP. Defaults to `3`. After exceeding this limit, the OTP becomes invalid and the user needs to request a new one.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        emailOTP({
            allowedAttempts: 5, // Allow 5 attempts before invalidating the OTP
            expiresIn: 300
        })
    ]
})
```

When the maximum attempts are exceeded, the `verifyOTP`, `signIn.emailOtp`, `verifyEmail`, and `resetPassword` methods will return an error with code `MAX_ATTEMPTS_EXCEEDED`.

- `storeOTP`: The method to store the OTP in your database, wether `encrypted`, `hashed` or `plain` text. Default is `plain` text.

<Callout>
Note: This will not affect the OTP sent to the user, it will only affect the OTP stored in your database.
</Callout>

Alternatively, you can pass a custom encryptor or hasher to store the OTP in your database.

**Custom encryptor**

```ts title="auth.ts"
emailOTP({
    storeOTP: { 
        encrypt: async (otp) => {
            return myCustomEncryptor(otp);
        },
        decrypt: async (otp) => {
            return myCustomDecryptor(otp);
        },
    }
})
```

**Custom hasher**

```ts title="auth.ts"
emailOTP({
    storeOTP: {
        hash: async (otp) => {
            return myCustomHasher(otp);
        },
    }
})
```

                ] // [!code highlight]
            }) // [!code highlight]
        ]
    })
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add the client plugin

    Include the Generic OAuth client plugin in your authentication client instance.

    ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
    import { genericOAuthClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
    
    export const authClient = createAuthClient({
        plugins: [
            genericOAuthClient()
        ]
    })
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

The Generic OAuth plugin provides endpoints for initiating the OAuth flow and handling the callback. Here's how to use them:

### Initiate OAuth Sign-In

To start the OAuth sign-in process:

<APIMethod path="/sign-in/oauth2" method="POST">
```ts
type signInWithOAuth2 = {
    /**
     * The provider ID for the OAuth provider. 
     */
    providerId: string = "provider-id"
    /**
     * The URL to redirect to after sign in. 
     */
    callbackURL?: string = "/dashboard"
    /**
     * The URL to redirect to if an error occurs. 
     */
    errorCallbackURL?: string = "/error-page"
    /**
     * The URL to redirect to after login if the user is new. 
     */
    newUserCallbackURL?: string = "/welcome"
    /**
     * Disable redirect. 
     */
    disableRedirect?: boolean = false
    /**
     * Scopes to be passed to the provider authorization request. 
     */
    scopes?: string[] = ["my-scope"]
    /**
     * Explicitly request sign-up. Useful when disableImplicitSignUp is true for this provider. 
     */
    requestSignUp?: boolean = false
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Linking OAuth Accounts

To link an OAuth account to an existing user:

<APIMethod
  path="/oauth2/link"
  method="POST"
  requireSession
>
```ts
type oAuth2LinkAccount = {
    /**
     * The OAuth provider ID. 
     */
    providerId: string = "my-provider-id"
    /**
     * The URL to redirect to once the account linking was complete. 
     */
    callbackURL: string = "/successful-link"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Handle OAuth Callback

The plugin mounts a route to handle the OAuth callback `/oauth2/callback/:providerId`. This means by default `${baseURL}/api/auth/oauth2/callback/:providerId` will be used as the callback URL. Make sure your OAuth provider is configured to use this URL.

## Configuration

When adding the plugin to your auth config, you can configure multiple OAuth providers. Each provider configuration object supports the following options:

```ts
interface GenericOAuthConfig {
  providerId: string;
  discoveryUrl?: string;
  authorizationUrl?: string;
  tokenUrl?: string;
  userInfoUrl?: string;
  clientId: string;
  clientSecret: string;
  scopes?: string[];
  redirectURI?: string;
  responseType?: string;
  prompt?: string;
  pkce?: boolean;
  accessType?: string;
  getUserInfo?: (tokens: OAuth2Tokens) => Promise<User | null>;
}
```

### Other Provider Configurations

**providerId**: A unique string to identify the OAuth provider configuration.

**discoveryUrl**: (Optional) URL to fetch the provider's OAuth 2.0/OIDC configuration. If provided, endpoints like `authorizationUrl`, `tokenUrl`, and `userInfoUrl` can be auto-discovered.

**authorizationUrl**: (Optional) The OAuth provider's authorization endpoint. Not required if using `discoveryUrl`.

**tokenUrl**: (Optional) The OAuth provider's token endpoint. Not required if using `discoveryUrl`.

**userInfoUrl**: (Optional) The endpoint to fetch user profile information. Not required if using `discoveryUrl`.

**clientId**: The OAuth client ID issued by your provider.

**clientSecret**: The OAuth client secret issued by your provider.

**scopes**: (Optional) An array of scopes to request from the provider (e.g., `["openid", "email", "profile"]`).

**redirectURI**: (Optional) The redirect URI to use for the OAuth flow. If not set, a default is constructed based on your app's base URL.

**responseType**: (Optional) The OAuth response type. Defaults to `"code"` for authorization code flow.

**responseMode**: (Optional) The response mode for the authorization code request, such as `"query"` or `"form_post"`.

**prompt**: (Optional) Controls the authentication experience (e.g., force login, consent, etc.).

**pkce**: (Optional) If true, enables PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security. Defaults to `false`.

**accessType**: (Optional) The access type for the authorization request. Use `"offline"` to request a refresh token.

**getUserInfo**: (Optional) A custom function to fetch user info from the provider, given the OAuth tokens. If not provided, a default fetch is used.

**mapProfileToUser**: (Optional) A function to map the provider's user profile to your app's user object. Useful for custom field mapping or transformations.

**authorizationUrlParams**: (Optional) Additional query parameters to add to the authorization URL. These can override default parameters.

**disableImplicitSignUp**: (Optional) If true, disables automatic sign-up for new users. Sign-in must be explicitly requested with sign-up intent.

**disableSignUp**: (Optional) If true, disables sign-up for new users entirely. Only existing users can sign in.

**authentication**: (Optional) The authentication method for token requests. Can be `'basic'` or `'post'`. Defaults to `'post'`.

**discoveryHeaders**: (Optional) Custom headers to include in the discovery request. Useful for providers that require special headers.

**authorizationHeaders**: (Optional) Custom headers to include in the authorization request. Useful for providers that require special headers.

**overrideUserInfo**: (Optional) If true, the user's info in your database will be updated with the provider's info every time they sign in. Defaults to `false`.

## Advanced Usage

### Custom User Info Fetching

You can provide a custom `getUserInfo` function to handle specific provider requirements:

```ts
genericOAuth({
  config: [
    {
      providerId: "custom-provider",
      // ... other config options
      getUserInfo: async (tokens) => {
        // Custom logic to fetch and return user info
        const userInfo = await fetchUserInfoFromCustomProvider(tokens);
        return {
          id: userInfo.sub,
          email: userInfo.email,
          name: userInfo.name,
          // ... map other fields as needed
        };
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

### Map User Info Fields

If the user info returned by the provider does not match the expected format, or you need to map additional fields, you can use the `mapProfileToUser`:

```ts
genericOAuth({
  config: [
    {
      providerId: "custom-provider",
      // ... other config options
      mapProfileToUser: async (profile) => {
        return {
          firstName: profile.given_name,
          // ... map other fields as needed
        };
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

### Error Handling

The plugin includes built-in error handling for common OAuth issues. Errors are typically redirected to your application's error page with an appropriate error message in the URL parameters. If the callback URL is not provided, the user will be redirected to Better Auth's default error page.

title: Have I Been Pwned
description: A plugin to check if a password has been compromised
---

The Have I Been Pwned plugin helps protect user accounts by preventing the use of passwords that have been exposed in known data breaches. It uses the [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) API to check if a password has been compromised.

## Installation

### Add the plugin to your **auth** config
```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { haveIBeenPwned } from "better-auth/plugins" // [!code highlight]

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        haveIBeenPwned()
    ]
})
```

## Usage

When a user attempts to create an account or update their password with a compromised password, they'll receive the following default error:

```json
{
  "code": "PASSWORD_COMPROMISED",
  "message": "Password is compromised"
}
```

## Config

You can customize the error message:

```ts
haveIBeenPwned({
    customPasswordCompromisedMessage: "Please choose a more secure password."
})
```
## Security Notes

- Only the first 5 characters of the password hash are sent to the API
- The full password is never transmitted
- Provides an additional layer of account security

    ### Migrate the database

    Run the migration or generate the schema to add the necessary fields and tables to the database.

    <Tabs items={["migrate", "generate"]}>
        <Tab value="migrate">
        ```bash
        npx @better-auth/cli migrate

        </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    See the [Schema](#schema) section to add the fields manually.
</Step>
</Steps>    


## Usage

Once you've installed the plugin, you can start using the JWT & JWKS plugin to get the token and the JWKS through their respective endpoints.

## JWT

### Retrieve the token

1. Using your session token

To get the token, call the `/token` endpoint. This will return the following:
  
```json
  { 
    "token": "ey..."
  }
```

Make sure to include the token in the `Authorization` header of your requests and the `bearer` plugin is added in your auth configuration.

```ts
await fetch("/api/auth/token", {
  headers: {
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${token}`
  },
})
```

2. From `set-auth-jwt` header

When you call `getSession` method, a JWT is returned in the `set-auth-jwt` header, which you can use to send to your services directly.

```ts
await authClient.getSession({
  fetchOptions: {
    onSuccess: (ctx)=>{
      const jwt = ctx.response.headers.get("set-auth-jwt")
    }
  }
})
```

### Verifying the token
The token can be verified in your own service, without the need for an additional verify call or database check.
For this JWKS is used. The public key can be fetched from the `/api/auth/jwks` endpoint.

Since this key is not subject to frequent changes, it can be cached indefinitely.
The key ID (`kid`) that was used to sign a JWT is included in the header of the token.
In case a JWT with a different `kid` is received, it is recommended to fetch the JWKS again.

```json
  {
    "keys": [
        {
            "crv": "Ed25519",
            "x": "bDHiLTt7u-VIU7rfmcltcFhaHKLVvWFy-_csKZARUEU",
            "kty": "OKP",
            "kid": "c5c7995d-0037-4553-8aee-b5b620b89b23"
        }
    ]
  }
```

#### Example using jose with remote JWKS

```ts
import { jwtVerify, createRemoteJWKSet } from 'jose'

async function validateToken(token: string) {
  try {
    const JWKS = createRemoteJWKSet(
      new URL('http://localhost:3000/api/auth/jwks')
    )
    const { payload } = await jwtVerify(token, JWKS, {
      issuer: 'http://localhost:3000', // Should match your JWT issuer, which is the BASE_URL
      audience: 'http://localhost:3000', // Should match your JWT audience, which is the BASE_URL by default
    })
    return payload
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Token validation failed:', error)
    throw error
  }
}

// Usage example
const token = 'your.jwt.token' // this is the token you get from the /api/auth/token endpoint
const payload = await validateToken(token)
```

#### Example with local JWKS

```ts
import { jwtVerify, createLocalJWKSet } from 'jose'


async function validateToken(token: string) {
  try {
    /**
     * This is the JWKS that you get from the /api/auth/
     * jwks endpoint
     */
    const storedJWKS = {
      keys: [{
        //...
      }]
    };
    const JWKS = createLocalJWKSet({
      keys: storedJWKS.data?.keys!,
    })
    const { payload } = await jwtVerify(token, JWKS, {
      issuer: 'http://localhost:3000', // Should match your JWT issuer, which is the BASE_URL
      audience: 'http://localhost:3000', // Should match your JWT audience, which is the BASE_URL by default
    })
    return payload
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Token validation failed:', error)
    throw error
  }
}

// Usage example
const token = 'your.jwt.token' // this is the token you get from the /api/auth/token endpoint
const payload = await validateToken(token)
```

## Schema

The JWT plugin adds the following tables to the database:

### JWKS

Table Name: `jwks`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    { 
      name: "id", 
      type: "string", 
      description: "Unique identifier for each web key",
      isPrimaryKey: true
    },
    { 
      name: "publicKey", 
      type: "string", 
      description: "The public part of the web key" 
    },
    { 
      name: "privateKey", 
      type: "string", 
      description: "The private part of the web key" 
    },
    { 
      name: "createdAt", 
      type: "Date", 
      description: "Timestamp of when the web key was created" 
    },
  ]}
  />

<Callout>
  You can customize the table name and fields for the `jwks` table. See the [Database concept documentation](/docs/concepts/database#custom-table-names) for more information on how to customize plugin schema.
</Callout>

## Options

### Algorithm of the Key Pair

The algorithm used for the generation of the key pair. The default is **EdDSA** with the **Ed25519** curve. Below are the available options:

```ts title="auth.ts"
jwt({
  jwks: {
    keyPairConfig: {
      alg: "EdDSA",
      crv: "Ed25519"
    }
  }
})
```

#### EdDSA
- **Default Curve**: `Ed25519`
- **Optional Property**: `crv`
  - Available options: `Ed25519`, `Ed448`
  - Default: `Ed25519`

#### ES256
- No additional properties

#### RSA256
- **Optional Property**: `modulusLength`
  - Expects a number
  - Default: `2048`

#### PS256
- **Optional Property**: `modulusLength`
  - Expects a number
  - Default: `2048`

#### ECDH-ES
- **Optional Property**: `crv`
  - Available options: `P-256`, `P-384`, `P-521`
  - Default: `P-256`

#### ES512
- No additional properties


### Disable private key encryption

By default, the private key is encrypted using AES256 GCM. You can disable this by setting the `disablePrivateKeyEncryption` option to `true`.

For security reasons, it's recommended to keep the private key encrypted.

```ts title="auth.ts"
jwt({
  jwks: {
    disablePrivateKeyEncryption: true
  }
})
```

### Modify JWT payload

By default the entire user object is added to the JWT payload. You can modify the payload by providing a function to the `definePayload` option.

```ts title="auth.ts"
jwt({
  jwt: {
    definePayload: ({user}) => {
      return {
        id: user.id,
        email: user.email,
        role: user.role
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Modify Issuer, Audience, Subject or Expiration time
If none is given, the `BASE_URL` is used as the issuer and the audience is set to the `BASE_URL`. The expiration time is set to 15 minutes.

```ts title="auth.ts"
jwt({
  jwt: {
    issuer: "https://example.com",
    audience: "https://example.com",
    expirationTime: "1h",
    getSubject: (session) => {
      // by default the subject is the user id
      return session.user.email
    }
  }
})
```

title: Magic link
description: Magic link plugin
---

Magic link or email link is a way to authenticate users without a password. When a user enters their email, a link is sent to their email. When the user clicks on the link, they are authenticated.

## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Add the server Plugin

    Add the magic link plugin to your server:

    ```ts title="server.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
    import { magicLink } from "better-auth/plugins";

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        plugins: [
            magicLink({
                sendMagicLink: async ({ email, token, url }, request) => {
                    // send email to user
                }
            })
        ]
    })
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Add the client Plugin

    Add the magic link plugin to your client:

    ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
    import { magicLinkClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins";
    export const authClient = createAuthClient({
        plugins: [
            magicLinkClient()
        ]
    });
    ```
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Usage

### Sign In with Magic Link

To sign in with a magic link, you need to call `signIn.magicLink` with the user's email address. The `sendMagicLink` function is called to send the magic link to the user's email.


<APIMethod
  path="/sign-in/magic-link"
  method="POST"
  requireSession
>
  
```ts
type signInMagicLink = {
    /**
     * Email address to send the magic link. 
     */
    email: string = "user@email.com"
    /**
     * User display name. Only used if the user is registering for the first time. 
     */
    name?: string = "my-name"
    /**
     * URL to redirect after magic link verification. 
     */
    callbackURL?: string = "/dashboard"
    /**
     * URL to redirect after new user signup
     */
    newUserCallbackURL?: string = "/welcome"
    /**
     * URL to redirect if an error happen on verification
     * If only callbackURL is provided but without an `errorCallbackURL` then they will be 
     * redirected to the callbackURL with an `error` query parameter.
     */
    errorCallbackURL?: string = "/error"
}
```
</APIMethod>

<Callout>
If the user has not signed up, unless `disableSignUp` is set to `true`, the user will be signed up automatically.
</Callout>

### Verify Magic Link

When you send the URL generated by the `sendMagicLink` function to a user, clicking the link will authenticate them and redirect them to the `callbackURL` specified in the `signIn.magicLink` function. If an error occurs, the user will be redirected to the `callbackURL` with an error query parameter.

<Callout type="warn">
  If no `callbackURL` is provided, the user will be redirected to the root URL.
</Callout>

If you want to handle the verification manually, (e.g, if you send the user a different URL), you can use the `verify` function.


<APIMethod
  path="/magic-link/verify"
  method="GET"
  requireSession
>
```ts
type magicLinkVerify = {
    /**
     * Verification token. 
     */
    token: string = "123456"
    /**
     * URL to redirect after magic link verification, if not provided will return the session. 
     */
    callbackURL?: string = "/dashboard"
}
```
</APIMethod>

## Configuration Options

**sendMagicLink**: The `sendMagicLink` function is called when a user requests a magic link. It takes an object with the following properties:

- `email`: The email address of the user.
- `url`: The URL to be sent to the user. This URL contains the token.
- `token`: The token if you want to send the token with custom URL.

and a `request` object as the second parameter.

**expiresIn**: specifies the time in seconds after which the magic link will expire. The default value is `300` seconds (5 minutes).

**disableSignUp**: If set to `true`, the user will not be able to sign up using the magic link. The default value is `false`.

**generateToken**: The `generateToken` function is called to generate a token which is used to uniquely identify the user. The default value is a random string. There is one parameter:

- `email`: The email address of the user.

<Callout type="warn">
  When using `generateToken`, ensure that the returned string is hard to guess
  because it is used to verify who someone actually is in a confidential way. By
  default, we return a long and cryptographically secure string.
</Callout>

**storeToken**: The `storeToken` function is called to store the magic link token in the database. The default value is `"plain"`.

The `storeToken` function can be one of the following:

- `"plain"`: The token is stored in plain text.
- `"hashed"`: The token is hashed using the default hasher.
- `{ type: "custom-hasher", hash: (token: string) => Promise<string> }`: The token is hashed using a custom hasher.

`OAuth` `MCP`

The **MCP** plugin lets your app act as an OAuth provider for MCP clients. It handles authentication and makes it easy to issue and manage access tokens for MCP applications.

## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Add the Plugin

        Add the MCP plugin to your auth configuration and specify the login page path.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
        import { mcp } from "better-auth/plugins";

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            plugins: [
                mcp({
                    loginPage: "/sign-in" // path to your login page
                })
            ]
        });
        ```
        <Callout>
            This doesn't have a client plugin, so you don't need to make any changes to your authClient.
        </Callout>
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Generate Schema

        Run the migration or generate the schema to add the necessary fields and tables to the database.

        <Tabs items={["migrate", "generate"]}>
            <Tab value="migrate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli migrate
            ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="generate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli generate
            ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
        The MCP plugin uses the same schema as the OIDC Provider plugin. See the [OIDC Provider Schema](#schema) section for details.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

### OAuth Discovery Metadata

Add a route to expose OAuth metadata for MCP clients:

```ts title=".well-known/oauth-authorization-server/route.ts"
import { oAuthDiscoveryMetadata } from "better-auth/plugins";
import { auth } from "../../../lib/auth";

export const GET = oAuthDiscoveryMetadata(auth);
```

### MCP Session Handling

You can use the helper function `withMcpAuth` to get the session and handle unauthenticated calls automatically.


```ts title="api/[transport]/route.ts"
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth";
import { createMcpHandler } from "@vercel/mcp-adapter";
import { withMcpAuth } from "better-auth/plugins";
import { z } from "zod";

const handler = withMcpAuth(auth, (req, session) => {
    // session contains the access token record with scopes and user ID
    return createMcpHandler(
        (server) => {
            server.tool(
                "echo",
                "Echo a message",
                { message: z.string() },
                async ({ message }) => {
                    return {
                        content: [{ type: "text", text: `Tool echo: ${message}` }],
                    };
                },
            );
        },
        {
            capabilities: {
                tools: {
                    echo: {
                        description: "Echo a message",
                    },
                },
            },
        },
        {
            redisUrl: process.env.REDIS_URL,
            basePath: "/api",
            verboseLogs: true,
            maxDuration: 60,
        },
    )(req);
});

export { handler as GET, handler as POST, handler as DELETE };
```

You can also use `auth.api.getMcpSession` to get the session using the access token sent from the MCP client:

```ts title="api/[transport]/route.ts"
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth";
import { createMcpHandler } from "@vercel/mcp-adapter";
import { z } from "zod";

const handler = async (req: Request) => {
     // session contains the access token record with scopes and user ID
    const session = await auth.api.getMcpSession({
        headers: req.headers
    })
    if(!session){
        //this is important and you must return 401
        return new Response(null, {
            status: 401
        })
    }
    return createMcpHandler(
        (server) => {
            server.tool(
                "echo",
                "Echo a message",
                { message: z.string() },
                async ({ message }) => {
                    return {
                        content: [{ type: "text", text: `Tool echo: ${message}` }],
                    };
                },
            );
        },
        {
            capabilities: {
                tools: {
                    echo: {
                        description: "Echo a message",
                    },
                },
            },
        },
        {
            redisUrl: process.env.REDIS_URL,
            basePath: "/api",
            verboseLogs: true,

export { handler as GET, handler as POST, handler as DELETE };
```

## Configuration

The MCP plugin accepts the following configuration options:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    loginPage: {
        description: "Path to the login page where users will be redirected for authentication",
        type: "string",
        required: true
    },
    oidcConfig: {
        description: "Optional OIDC configuration options",
        type: "object",
        required: false
    }
  }}
/>

### OIDC Configuration

The plugin supports additional OIDC configuration options through the `oidcConfig` parameter:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    codeExpiresIn: {
        description: "Expiration time for authorization codes in seconds",
        type: "number",
        default: 600
    },
    accessTokenExpiresIn: {
        description: "Expiration time for access tokens in seconds",
        type: "number",
        default: 3600
    },
    refreshTokenExpiresIn: {
        description: "Expiration time for refresh tokens in seconds",
        type: "number",
        default: 604800
    },
    defaultScope: {
        description: "Default scope for OAuth requests",
        type: "string",
        default: "openid"
    },
    scopes: {
        description: "Additional scopes to support",
        type: "string[]",
        default: '["openid", "profile", "email", "offline_access"]'
    }
  }}
/>

## Schema

The MCP plugin uses the same schema as the OIDC Provider plugin. See the [OIDC Provider Schema](#schema) section for details.

title: Multi Session
description: Learn how to use multi-session plugin in Better Auth.
---

The multi-session plugin allows users to maintain multiple active sessions across different accounts in the same browser. This plugin is useful for applications that require users to switch between multiple accounts without logging out.

## Installation

<Steps>
<Step>
### Add the plugin to your **auth** config
```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { multiSession } from "better-auth/plugins"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
        multiSession(), // [!code highlight]
    ] // [!code highlight]
})
```
</Step>
<Step>
        ### Add the client Plugin

        Add the client plugin and Specify where the user should be redirected if they need to verify 2nd factor

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        import { multiSessionClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

        export const authClient = createAuthClient({
            plugins: [
                multiSessionClient()
            ]
        })
        ```
        </Step>
</Steps>    


## Usage

Whenever a user logs in, the plugin will add additional cookie to the browser. This cookie will be used to maintain multiple sessions across different accounts. 


### List all device sessions

To list all active sessions for the current user, you can call the `listDeviceSessions` method.

<APIMethod
  path="/multi-session/list-device-sessions"
  method="GET"
  requireSession
>
```ts
type listDeviceSessions = {
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Set active session

To set the active session, you can call the `setActive` method.

<APIMethod
  path="/multi-session/set-active"
  method="POST"
  requireSession
>
```ts
type setActiveSession = {
    /**
     * The session token to set as active. 
     */
    sessionToken: string = "some-session-token"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Revoke a session

To revoke a session, you can call the `revoke` method.

<APIMethod
  path="/multi-session/revoke"
  method="POST"
  requireSession
>
```ts
type revokeDeviceSession = {
    /**
     * The session token to revoke. 
     */
    sessionToken: string = "some-session-token"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Signout and Revoke all sessions

When a user logs out, the plugin will revoke all active sessions for the user. You can do this by calling the existing `signOut` method, which handles revoking all sessions automatically.

### Max Sessions

You can specify the maximum number of sessions a user can have by passing the `maximumSessions` option to the plugin. By default, the plugin allows 5 sessions per device.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        multiSession({
            maximumSessions: 3
        })
    ]
})
```

<file path="docs/better-auth/plugins/oauth-proxy.mdx">
---
title: OAuth Proxy
description: OAuth Proxy plugin for Better Auth
---

A proxy plugin, that allows you to proxy OAuth requests. Useful for development and preview deployments where the redirect URL can't be known in advance to add to the OAuth provider. 

## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Add the plugin to your **auth** config
    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
    import { oAuthProxy } from "better-auth/plugins"

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
            oAuthProxy({
                productionURL: "https://my-main-app.com", // Optional - if the URL isn't inferred correctly // [!code highlight]
                currentURL: "http://localhost:3000", // Optional - if the URL isn't inferred correctly // [!code highlight] 
            }), // [!code highlight]
        ] // [!code highlight]
    })
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### Add redirect URL to your OAuth provider

   For the proxy server to work properly, you’ll need to pass the redirect URL of your main production app registered with the OAuth provider in your social provider config. This needs to be done for each social provider you want to proxy requests for.

    ```ts
    export const auth = betterAuth({
       plugins: [
           oAuthProxy(),
       ], 
       socialProviders: {
            github: {
                clientId: "your-client-id",
                clientSecret: "your-client-secret",
                redirectURI: "https://my-main-app.com/api/auth/callback/github" // [!code highlight]
            }
       }
    })
    ```
    </Step>
</Steps>    


## How it works

The plugin adds an endpoint to your server that proxies OAuth requests. When you initiate a social sign-in, it sets the redirect URL to this proxy endpoint. After the OAuth provider redirects back to your server, the plugin then forwards the user to the original callback URL.

```ts
await authClient.signIn.social({
    provider: "github",
    callbackURL: "/dashboard" // the plugin will override this to something like "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/oauth-proxy?callbackURL=/dashboard"
})
```

When the OAuth provider returns the user to your server, the plugin automatically redirects them to the intended callback URL.

<Callout>
To share cookies between the proxy server and your main server it uses URL query parameters to pass the cookies encrypted in the URL. This is secure as the cookies are encrypted and can only be decrypted by the server.
</Callout>

## Options

**currentURL**: The application's current URL is automatically determined by the plugin. It first checks for the request URL if invoked by a client, then it checks the base URL from popular hosting providers, and finally falls back to the `baseURL` in your auth config. If the URL isn’t inferred correctly, you can specify it manually here.

**productionURL**: If this value matches the `baseURL` in your auth config, requests will not be proxied. Defaults to the `BETTER_AUTH_URL` environment variable.

        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

Once installed, you can utilize the OIDC Provider to manage authentication flows within your application.

### Register a New Client

To register a new OIDC client, use the `oauth2.register` method.


#### Simple Example

```ts
const application = await client.oauth2.register({
    client_name: "My Client",
    redirect_uris: ["https://client.example.com/callback"],
});
```


#### Full Method


<APIMethod path="/oauth2/register" method="POST">
```ts
type registerOAuthApplication = {
    /**
     * A list of redirect URIs. 
     */
    redirect_uris: string[] = ["https://client.example.com/callback"]
    /**
     * The authentication method for the token endpoint. 
     */
    token_endpoint_auth_method?: "none" | "client_secret_basic" | "client_secret_post" = "client_secret_basic"
    /**
     * The grant types supported by the application. 
     */
    grant_types?: ("authorization_code" | "implicit" | "password" | "client_credentials" | "refresh_token" | "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer" | "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:saml2-bearer")[] = ["authorization_code"]
    /**
     * The response types supported by the application. 
     */
    response_types?: ("code" | "token")[] = ["code"]
    /**
     * The name of the application. 
     */
    client_name?: string = "My App"
    /**

    /**
     * The JWKS of the application. 
     */
    jwks?: Record<string, any> = {"keys": [{"kty": "RSA", "alg": "RS256", "use": "sig", "n": "...", "e": "..."}]}
    /**
     * The metadata of the application. 
     */
    metadata?: Record<string, any> = {"key": "value"}
    /**
     * The software ID of the application. 
     */
    software_id?: string = "my-software"
    /**
     * The software version of the application. 
     */
    software_version?: string = "1.0.0"
    /**
     * The software statement of the application. 
     */
    software_statement?: string
}
```
</APIMethod>

<Callout>
This endpoint supports [RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591) compliant client registration.
</Callout>

Once the application is created, you will receive a `client_id` and `client_secret` that you can display to the user.

This Endpoint support [RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591) compliant client registration.
  
### Trusted Clients

For first-party applications and internal services, you can configure trusted clients directly in your OIDC provider configuration. Trusted clients bypass database lookups for better performance and can optionally skip consent screens for improved user experience.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { oidcProvider } from "better-auth/plugins";

const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
      oidcProvider({
        loginPage: "/sign-in",
        trustedClients: [
            {
                clientId: "internal-dashboard",
                clientSecret: "secure-secret-here",
                name: "Internal Dashboard",
                type: "web",
                redirectURLs: ["https://dashboard.company.com/auth/callback"],
                disabled: false,
                skipConsent: true, // Skip consent for this trusted client
                metadata: { internal: true }
            },
            {
                clientId: "mobile-app",
                clientSecret: "mobile-secret", 
                name: "Company Mobile App",
                type: "native",
                redirectURLs: ["com.company.app://auth"],
                disabled: false,
                skipConsent: false, // Still require consent if needed
                metadata: {}
            }
        ]
    })]
})
```

### UserInfo Endpoint

The OIDC Provider includes a UserInfo endpoint that allows clients to retrieve information about the authenticated user. This endpoint is available at `/oauth2/userinfo` and requires a valid access token.

<Endpoint path="/oauth2/userinfo" method="GET" />

```ts title="client-app.ts"
// Example of how a client would use the UserInfo endpoint
const response = await fetch('https://your-domain.com/api/auth/oauth2/userinfo', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN'
  }
});

const userInfo = await response.json();
// userInfo contains user details based on the scopes granted
```

The UserInfo endpoint returns different claims based on the scopes that were granted during authorization:

- With `openid` scope: Returns the user's ID (`sub` claim)
- With `profile` scope: Returns name, picture, given_name, family_name
- With `email` scope: Returns email and email_verified

The `getAdditionalUserInfoClaim` function receives the user object and the requested scopes array, allowing you to conditionally include claims based on the scopes granted during authorization. These additional claims will be included in both the UserInfo endpoint response and the ID token.

### Consent Screen

When a user is redirected to the OIDC provider for authentication, they may be prompted to authorize the application to access their data. This is known as the consent screen. By default, Better Auth will display a sample consent screen. You can customize the consent screen by providing a `consentPage` option during initialization.

**Note**: Trusted clients with `skipConsent: true` will bypass the consent screen entirely, providing a seamless experience for first-party applications.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [oidcProvider({
        consentPage: "/path/to/consent/page"
    })]
})
```

The plugin will redirect the user to the specified path with a `client_id` and `scope` query parameter. You can use this information to display a custom consent screen. Once the user consents, you can call `oauth2.consent` to complete the authorization.

<Endpoint path="/oauth2/consent" method="POST" />

```ts title="server.ts"
const res = await client.oauth2.consent({
	accept: true, // or false to deny
});
```

The `client_id` and other necessary information are stored in the browser cookie, so you don't need to pass them in the request. If they don't exist in the cookie, the consent method will return an error.

### Handling Login

When a user is redirected to the OIDC provider for authentication, if they are not already logged in, they will be redirected to the login page. You can customize the login page by providing a `loginPage` option during initialization.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [oidcProvider({
        loginPage: "/sign-in"
    })]
})
```

You don't need to handle anything from your side; when a new session is created, the plugin will handle continuing the authorization flow.

## Configuration

### OIDC Metadata

Customize the OIDC metadata by providing a configuration object during initialization.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { oidcProvider } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [oidcProvider({
        metadata: {
            issuer: "https://your-domain.com",
            authorization_endpoint: "/custom/oauth2/authorize",
            token_endpoint: "/custom/oauth2/token",
            // ...other custom metadata
        }
    })]
})
```

### JWKS Endpoint

The OIDC Provider plugin can integrate with the JWT plugin to provide proper asymmetric key signing for ID tokens. When enabled, ID tokens will be signed using RSA/EdDSA keys and can be verified using the JWKS endpoint.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { oidcProvider } from "better-auth/plugins";
import { jwt } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        jwt(), // Make sure to add the JWT plugin
        oidcProvider({
            useJWTPlugin: true, // Enable JWT plugin integration
            loginPage: "/sign-in",
            // ... other options
        })
    ]
})
```

<Callout type="info">
When `useJWTPlugin: false` (default), ID tokens are signed with the application secret.
</Callout>

### Dynamic Client Registration

If you want to allow clients to register dynamically, you can enable this feature by setting the `allowDynamicClientRegistration` option to `true`.

```ts title="auth.ts"
const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [oidcProvider({
        allowDynamicClientRegistration: true,
    })]
})
```

This will allow clients to register using the `/register` endpoint to be publicly available.

## Schema

The OIDC Provider plugin adds the following tables to the database:

### OAuth Application

Table Name: `oauthApplication`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
   {
      name: "id",
      type: "string",

title: One Tap
description: One Tap plugin for Better Auth
---

The One Tap plugin allows users to log in with a single tap using Google's One Tap API. The plugin
provides a simple way to integrate One Tap into your application, handling the client-side and server-side logic for you.

## Installation

### Add the Server Plugin

Add the One Tap plugin to your auth configuration:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { oneTap } from "better-auth/plugins"; // [!code highlight]

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
        oneTap(), // Add the One Tap server plugin  // [!code highlight]
    ] // [!code highlight]
});
```

### Add the Client Plugin

Add the client plugin and specify where the user should be redirected after sign-in or if additional verification (like 2FA) is needed.


```ts
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import { oneTapClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins";

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
  plugins: [
    oneTapClient({
      clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
      // Optional client configuration:
      autoSelect: false,
      cancelOnTapOutside: true,
      context: "signin",
      additionalOptions: {
        // Any extra options for the Google initialize method
      },
      // Configure prompt behavior and exponential backoff:
      promptOptions: {
        baseDelay: 1000,   // Base delay in ms (default: 1000)
        maxAttempts: 5     // Maximum number of attempts before triggering onPromptNotification (default: 5)
      }
    })
  ]
});
```

### Usage

To display the One Tap popup, simply call the oneTap method on your auth client:

```ts
await authClient.oneTap();
```

### Customizing Redirect Behavior

By default, after a successful login the plugin will hard redirect the user to `/`. You can customize this behavior as follows:

#### Avoiding a Hard Redirect

Pass fetchOptions with an onSuccess callback to handle the login response without a page reload:

```ts
await authClient.oneTap({
  fetchOptions: {
    onSuccess: () => {
      // For example, use a router to navigate without a full reload:
      router.push("/dashboard");
    }
  }
});
```

#### Specifying a Custom Callback URL

To perform a hard redirect to a different page after login, use the callbackURL option:

```ts
await authClient.oneTap({
  callbackURL: "/dashboard"
});
```

#### Handling Prompt Dismissals with Exponential Backoff

If the user dismisses or skips the prompt, the plugin will retry showing the One Tap prompt using exponential backoff based on your configured promptOptions.

If the maximum number of attempts is reached without a successful sign-in, you can use the onPromptNotification callback to be notified—allowing you to render an alternative UI (e.g., a traditional Google Sign-In button) so users can restart the process manually:

```ts
await authClient.oneTap({
  onPromptNotification: (notification) => {
    console.warn("Prompt was dismissed or skipped. Consider displaying an alternative sign-in option.", notification);
    // Render your alternative UI here
  }
});
```

### Client Options

- **clientId**: The client ID for your Google One Tap API.
- **autoSelect**: Automatically select the account if the user is already signed in. Default is false.
- **context**: The context in which the One Tap API should be used (e.g., "signin"). Default is "signin".
- **cancelOnTapOutside**: Cancel the One Tap popup when the user taps outside it. Default is true.
- additionalOptions: Extra options to pass to Google's initialize method as per the [Google Identity Services docs](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/reference/js-reference#google.accounts.id.prompt).
- **promptOptions**: Configuration for the prompt behavior and exponential backoff:
- **baseDelay**: Base delay in milliseconds for retries. Default is 1000.
- **maxAttempts**: Maximum number of prompt attempts before invoking the onPromptNotification callback. Default is 5.

### Server Options

- **disableSignUp**:  Disable the sign-up option, allowing only existing users to sign in. Default is `false`.
- **ClientId**: Optionally, pass a client ID here if it is not provided in your social provider configuration.

title: One-Time Token Plugin
description: Generate and verify single-use token
---

The One-Time Token (OTT) plugin provides functionality to generate and verify secure, single-use session tokens. These are commonly used for across domains authentication.

## Installation

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { oneTimeToken } from "better-auth/plugins/one-time-token";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
      oneTimeToken()
    ]
    // ... other auth config
});
```

## Usage

### 1. Generate a Token

Generate a token using `auth.api.generateOneTimeToken` or `authClient.oneTimeToken.generate`

<APIMethod
  path="/one-time-token/generate"
  method="GET"
  requireSession
>
```ts
type generateOneTimeToken = {
}
```
</APIMethod>

This will return a `token` that is attached to the current session which can be used to verify the one-time token. By default, the token will expire in 3 minutes.

### 2. Verify the Token

When the user clicks the link or submits the token, use the `auth.api.verifyOneTimeToken` or `authClient.oneTimeToken.verify` method in another API route to validate it.

<APIMethod path="/one-time-token/verify" method="POST">
```ts
type verifyOneTimeToken = {
    /**
     * The token to verify. 
     */
    token: string = "some-token"
}
```
</APIMethod>

This will return the session that was attached to the token.

## Options

These options can be configured when adding the `oneTimeToken` plugin:

*   **`disableClientRequest`** (boolean): Optional. If `true`, the token will only be generated on the server side. Default: `false`.
*   **`expiresIn`** (number): Optional. The duration for which the token is valid in minutes. Default: `3`.

```ts
oneTimeToken({
    expiresIn: 10 // 10 minutes
})
```
* **`generateToken`**: A custom token generator function that takes `session` object and a `ctx` as paramters.

* **`storeToken`**: Optional. This option allows you to configure how the token is stored in your database.

    * **`plain`**: The token is stored in plain text. (Default)
    * **`hashed`**: The token is hashed using the default hasher.
    * **`custom-hasher`**: A custom hasher function that takes a token and returns a hashed token.

<Callout type="info">
    Note: It will not affect the token that's sent, it will only affect the token stored in your database.
</Callout>

Examples:

```ts title="No hashing (default)"
oneTimeToken({
    storeToken: "plain"
})
```
```ts title="built-in hasher"
oneTimeToken({
    storeToken: "hashed"
})
```
```ts title="custom hasher"
oneTimeToken({
    storeToken: {
        type: "custom-hasher",
        hash: async (token) => {
            return myCustomHasher(token);
        }
    }
})
```

title: Open API
description: Open API reference for Better Auth.
---

This is a plugin that provides an Open API reference for Better Auth. It shows all endpoints added by plugins and the core. It also provides a way to test the endpoints. It uses [Scalar](https://scalar.com/) to display the Open API reference.


<Callout>
This plugin is still in the early stages of development. We are working on adding more features to it and filling in the gaps.
</Callout>


## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Add the plugin to your **auth** config
    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
    import { openAPI } from "better-auth/plugins"

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
            openAPI(), // [!code highlight]
        ] // [!code highlight]
    })
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
    ### Navigate to `/api/auth/reference` to view the Open API reference
    
    Each plugin endpoints are grouped by the plugin name. The core endpoints are grouped under the `Default` group. And Model schemas are grouped under the `Models` group.

    ![Open API reference](/open-api-reference.png)
    </Step>
</Steps>    



## Usage 

The Open API reference is generated using the [OpenAPI 3.0](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification. You can use the reference to generate client libraries, documentation, and more.

The reference is generated using the [Scalar](https://scalar.com/) library. Scalar provides a way to view and test the endpoints. You can test the endpoints by clicking on the `Try it out` button and providing the required parameters.

![Open API reference](/open-api-reference.png)

### Generated Schema

To get the generated Open API schema directly as JSON, you can do `auth.api.generateOpenAPISchema()`. This will return the Open API schema as a JSON object.

```ts
import { auth } from "~/lib/auth"

const openAPISchema = await auth.api.generateOpenAPISchema()
console.log(openAPISchema)
```

## Configuration

`path` - The path where the Open API reference is served. Default is `/api/auth/reference`. You can change it to any path you like, but keep in mind that it will be appended to the base path of your auth server.

`disableDefaultReference` - If set to `true`, the default Open API reference UI by Scalar will be disabled. Default is `false`.

        npx @better-auth/cli generate
        ```
        </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    See the [Schema](#schema) section to add the fields manually.
</Step>

<Step>
    ### Add the client plugin

    ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
    import { organizationClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

    export const authClient = createAuthClient({
        plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
            organizationClient() // [!code highlight]
        ] // [!code highlight]
    })
    ```
</Step>
</Steps>


## Usage

Once you've installed the plugin, you can start using the organization plugin to manage your organization's members and teams. The client plugin will provide you methods under the `organization` namespace. And the server `api` will provide you with the necessary endpoints to manage your organization and gives you easier way to call the functions on your own backend.

## Organization

### Create an organization

<APIMethod path="/organization/create" method="POST" requireSession>
  ```ts
  const metadata = { someKey: "someValue" };

  type createOrganization = {
    /**
     * The organization name.
    */
    name: string = "My Organization"
    /**
     * The organization slug.
    */
    slug: string = "my-org"
    /**
     * The organization logo.
    */
    logo?: string = "https://example.com/logo.png"
    /**
    * The metadata of the organization.
    */
    metadata?: Record<string, any>
    /**
    * The user id of the organization creator. If not provided, the current user will be used. Should only be used by admins or when called by the server.
    * @serverOnly
    */
    userId?: string = "some_user_id"
    /**
    * Whether to keep the current active organization active after creating a new one.
    */
    keepCurrentActiveOrganization?: boolean = false
  }
  ```
</APIMethod>

#### Restrict who can create an organization

By default, any user can create an organization. To restrict this, set the `allowUserToCreateOrganization` option to a function that returns a boolean, or directly to `true` or `false`.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins"

const auth = betterAuth({
    //...
    plugins: [
        organization({
            allowUserToCreateOrganization: async (user) => { // [!code highlight]
                const subscription = await getSubscription(user.id) // [!code highlight]
                return subscription.plan === "pro" // [!code highlight]
            } // [!code highlight]
        })
    ]
})
```

#### Check if organization slug is taken

To check if an organization slug is taken or not you can use the `checkSlug` function provided by the client. The function takes an object with the following properties:

<APIMethod path="/organization/check-slug" method="POST">
```ts
type checkOrganizationSlug = {
    /**
     * The organization slug to check.  
     */
    slug: string = "my-org"
}
```
</APIMethod>


#### Organization Creation Hooks

You can customize the organization creation process using hooks that run before and after an organization is created.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        organization({
            organizationCreation: {
                disabled: false, // Set to true to disable organization creation
                beforeCreate: async ({ organization, user }, request) => {
                    // Run custom logic before organization is created
                    // Optionally modify the organization data
                    return {
                        data: {
                            ...organization,
                            metadata: {
                                customField: "value"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                },
                afterCreate: async ({ organization, member, user }, request) => {
                    // Run custom logic after organization is created
                    // e.g., create default resources, send notifications
                    await setupDefaultResources(organization.id)
                }
            }
        })
    ]
})
```

The `beforeCreate` hook runs before an organization is created. It receives:

- `organization`: The organization data (without ID)
- `user`: The user creating the organization
- `request`: The HTTP request object (optional)

Return an object with `data` property to modify the organization data that will be created.

The `afterCreate` hook runs after an organization is successfully created. It receives:

- `organization`: The created organization (with ID)
- `member`: The member record for the creator
- `user`: The user who created the organization
- `request`: The HTTP request object (optional)


### List User's Organizations

To list the organizations that a user is a member of, you can use `useListOrganizations` hook. It implements a reactive way to get the organizations that the user is a member of.

<Tabs items={["React", "Vue", "Svelte"]} defaultValue="React">
<Tab value="React">
```tsx title="client.tsx"
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client"

function App(){
    const { data: organizations } = authClient.useListOrganizations()
    return (
        <div>
            {organizations.map(org => <p>{org.name}</p>)}
        </div>
    )
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab value="Svelte">
```svelte title="page.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  import { authClient } from "$lib/auth-client";
  const organizations = authClient.useListOrganizations();
</script>

<h1>Organizations</h1>s

{#if $organizations.isPending}
  <p>Loading...</p>
{:else if $organizations.data === null}
  <p>No organizations found.</p>
{:else}
  <ul>
    {#each $organizations.data as organization}
      <li>{organization.name}</li>
    {/each}
  </ul>
{/if}
```
</Tab>

<Tab value="Vue">
```vue title="organization.vue"
<script lang="ts">;
export default {
    setup() {
        const organizations = authClient.useListOrganizations()
        return { organizations };
    }
};
</script>

<template>
    <div>
        <h1>Organizations</h1>
        <div v-if="organizations.isPending">Loading...</div>
        <div v-else-if="organizations.data === null">No organizations found.</div>
        <ul v-else>
            <li v-for="organization in organizations.data" :key="organization.id">
                {{ organization.name }}
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</template>
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Or alternatively, you can call `organization.list` if you don't want to use a hook.

<APIMethod path="/organization/list" method="GET">
```ts
type listOrganizations = {
}
```
</APIMethod>


### Active Organization

Active organization is the workspace the user is currently working on. By default when the user is signed in the active organization is set to `null`. You can set the active organization to the user session.

<Callout type="info">
 It's not always you want to persist the active organization in the session. You can manage the active organization in the client side only. For example, multiple tabs can have different active organizations.
</Callout>

#### Set Active Organization

You can set the active organization by calling the `organization.setActive` function. It'll set the active organization for the user session.

<Callout>
  In some applications, you may want the ability to un-set an active organization.
  In this case, you can call this endpoint with `organizationId` set to `null`.
</Callout>

<APIMethod path="/organization/set-active" method="POST">
```ts
type setActiveOrganization = {
    /**
     * The organization id to set as active. It can be null to unset the active organization.  
     */
    organizationId?: string | null = "org-id"
    /**
     * The organization slug to set as active. It can be null to unset the active organization if organizationId is not provided.  
     */
    organizationSlug?: string = "org-slug"
}
```
</APIMethod>


To set active organization when a session is created you can use [database hooks](/docs/concepts/database#database-hooks).

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
  databaseHooks: {
      session: {
          create: {
              before: async(session)=>{
                  const organization = await getActiveOrganization(session.userId)
                  return {
                    data: {
                      ...session,
                      activeOrganizationId: organization.id
                    }
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  }
})
```

#### Use Active Organization

To retrieve the active organization for the user, you can call the `useActiveOrganization` hook. It returns the active organization for the user. Whenever the active organization changes, the hook will re-evaluate and return the new active organization.

<Tabs items={['React', 'Vue', 'Svelte']}>
    <Tab value="React">
    ```tsx title="client.tsx"
    import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client"

    function App(){
        const { data: activeOrganization } = authClient.useActiveOrganization()

    </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Get Full Organization

To get the full details of an organization, you can use the `getFullOrganization` function.
By default, if you don't pass any properties, it will use the active organization.

<APIMethod
  path="/organization/get-full-organization"
  method="GET"
  requireSession
>
```ts
type getFullOrganization = {
    /**
     * The organization id to get. By default, it will use the active organization.  
     */
    organizationId?: string = "org-id"
    /**
     * The organization slug to get.  
     */
    organizationSlug?: string = "org-slug"
    /**
     * The limit of members to get. By default, it uses the membershipLimit option which defaults to 100.
     */
    membersLimit?: number = 100
}
```
</APIMethod>


### Update Organization

To update organization info, you can use `organization.update`

<APIMethod
  path="/organization/update"
  method="POST"
  requireSession
>
```ts
type updateOrganization = {
    /**
     * A partial list of data to update the organization. 
     */
    data: {
        /**
         * The name of the organization. 
         */
        name?: string = "updated-name"
        /**
         * The slug of the organization. 
         */
        slug?: string = "updated-slug"
        /**
         * The logo of the organization. 
         */
        logo?: string = "new-logo.url"
        /**
         * The metadata of the organization. 
         */
        metadata?: Record<string, any> | null = { customerId: "test" }
    }
    /**
     * The organization ID. to update.
     */
    organizationId?: string = "org-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>


### Delete Organization

To remove user owned organization, you can use `organization.delete`

<APIMethod
  path="/organization/delete"
  method="POST"
  requireSession
>
```ts
type deleteOrganization = {
    /*
    * The organization id to delete.
    */
    organizationId: string = "org-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

If the user has the necessary permissions (by default: role is owner) in the specified organization, all members, invitations and organization information will be removed.

You can configure how organization deletion is handled through `organizationDeletion` option:

```ts
const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    organization({
      organizationDeletion: {
        disabled: true, //to disable it altogether
        beforeDelete: async (data, request) => {
          // a callback to run before deleting org
        },
        afterDelete: async (data, request) => {
          // a callback to run after deleting org
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Invitations

To add a member to an organization, we first need to send an invitation to the user. The user will receive an email/sms with the invitation link. Once the user accepts the invitation, they will be added to the organization.

### Setup Invitation Email

For member invitation to work we first need to provide `sendInvitationEmail` to the `better-auth` instance. This function is responsible for sending the invitation email to the user.

You'll need to construct and send the invitation link to the user. The link should include the invitation ID, which will be used with the acceptInvitation function when the user clicks on it.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins"
import { sendOrganizationInvitation } from "./email"
export const auth = betterAuth({
	plugins: [
		organization({
			async sendInvitationEmail(data) {
        const inviteLink = `https://example.com/accept-invitation/${data.id}`
				sendOrganizationInvitation({
					  email: data.email,
						invitedByUsername: data.inviter.user.name,
						invitedByEmail: data.inviter.user.email,
						teamName: data.organization.name,
						inviteLink
				})
			},
		}),
	],
});
```

### Send Invitation

To invite users to an organization, you can use the `invite` function provided by the client. The `invite` function takes an object with the following properties:

<APIMethod path="/organization/invite-member" method="POST">
```ts
type createInvitation = {
    /**
     * The email address of the user to invite.  
     */
    email: string = "example@gmail.com"
    /**
     * The role(s) to assign to the user. It can be `admin`, `member`, or `guest`.  
     */
    role: string | string[] = "member"
    /**
     * The organization ID to invite the user to. Defaults to the active organization.  
     */
    organizationId?: string = "org-id"
    /**
     * Resend the invitation email, if the user is already invited.  
     */
    resend?: boolean = true
    /**
     * The team ID to invite the user to.  
     */
    teamId?: string = "team-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

<Callout>
  - If the user is already a member of the organization, the invitation will be canceled.
  - If the user is already invited to the organization, unless `resend` is set to `true`, the invitation will not be sent again.
  - If `cancelPendingInvitationsOnReInvite` is set to `true`, the invitation will be canceled if the user is already invited to the organization and a new invitation is sent.
</Callout>

### Accept Invitation

When a user receives an invitation email, they can click on the invitation link to accept the invitation. The invitation link should include the invitation ID, which will be used to accept the invitation.

Make sure to call the `acceptInvitation` function after the user is logged in.

<APIMethod path="/organization/accept-invitation" method="POST">
```ts
type acceptInvitation = {
    /**
     * The ID of the invitation to accept.  
     */
    invitationId: string = "invitation-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>


### Cancel Invitation

If a user has sent out an invitation, you can use this method to cancel it.

If you're looking for how a user can reject an invitation, you can find that [here](#reject-invitation).

<APIMethod path="/organization/cancel-invitation" method="POST" noResult>
```ts
type cancelInvitation = {
    /**
     * The ID of the invitation to cancel.  
     */
    invitationId: string = "invitation-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Reject Invitation

If this user has received an invitation, but wants to decline it, this method will allow you to do so by rejecting it.

<APIMethod path="/organization/reject-invitation" method="POST" noResult>
```ts
type rejectInvitation = {
    /**
     * The ID of the invitation to reject.  
     */
    invitationId: string = "invitation-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Get Invitation

To get an invitation you can use the `organization.getInvitation` function provided by the client. You need to provide the invitation id as a query parameter.

<APIMethod
  path="/organization/get-invitation"
  method="GET"
  requireSession
>
```ts
type getInvitation = {
    /**
     * The ID of the invitation to get.  
     */
    id: string = "invitation-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### List Invitations

To list all invitations for a given organization you can use the `listInvitations` function provided by the client.

<APIMethod path="/organization/list-invitations" method="GET">
```ts
type listInvitations = {
    /**
     * An optional ID of the organization to list invitations for. If not provided, will default to the users active organization. 
     */
    organizationId?: string = "organization-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### List user invitations

To list all invitations for a given user you can use the `listUserInvitations` function provided by the client.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const invitations = await authClient.organization.listUserInvitations()
```

On the server, you can pass the user ID as a query parameter.

```ts title="api.ts"
const invitations = await auth.api.listUserInvitations({
    query: {
        email: "user@example.com"
    }
})
```
<Callout type="warn">
The `email` query parameter is only available on the server to query for invitations for a specific user.
</Callout>

## Members

### List Members

To list all members of an organization you can use the `listMembers` function.

<APIMethod path="/organization/list-members" method="GET">

```ts
type listMembers = {
    /**
     * An optional organization ID to list members for. If not provided, will default to the user's active organization. 
     */
    organizationId?: string = "organization-id"
    /**
     * The limit of members to return.
     */
    limit?: number = 100
    /**
     * The offset to start from.
     */
    offset?: number = 0
    /**
     * The field to sort by.
     */
    sortBy?: string = "createdAt"
    /**
     * The direction to sort by.
     */
    sortDirection?: "asc" | "desc" = "desc"
    /**
     * The field to filter by.
     */
    filterField?: string = "createdAt"
    /**
     * The operator to filter by.
     */
    filterOperator?: "eq" | "ne" | "gt" | "gte" | "lt" | "lte" | "in" | "nin" | "contains" = "eq"
    /**
     * The value to filter by.
     */
    filterValue?: string = "value"
    /**
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Remove Member

To remove you can use `organization.removeMember`


<APIMethod path="/organization/remove-member" method="POST">
```ts
type removeMember = {
    /**
     * The ID or email of the member to remove. 
     */
    memberIdOrEmail: string = "user@example.com"
    /**
     * The ID of the organization to remove the member from. If not provided, the active organization will be used. 
     */
    organizationId?: string = "org-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Update Member Role

To update the role of a member in an organization, you can use the `organization.updateMemberRole`. If the user has the permission to update the role of the member, the role will be updated.

<APIMethod path="/organization/update-member-role" method="POST" noResult>
```ts
type updateMemberRole = {
    /**
     * The new role to be applied. This can be a string or array of strings representing the roles. 
     */
    role: string | string[] = ["admin", "sale"]
    /**
     * The member id to apply the role update to. 
     */
    memberId: string = "member-id"
    /**
     * An optional organization ID which the member is a part of to apply the role update. If not provided, you must provide session headers to get the active organization. 
     */
    organizationId?: string = "organization-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Get Active Member

To get the current member of the active organization you can use the `organization.getActiveMember` function. This function will return the user's member details in their active organization.

<APIMethod
  path="/organization/get-active-member"
  method="GET"
  requireSession
  resultVariable="member"
>
```ts
type getActiveMember = {
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Add Member

If you want to add a member directly to an organization without sending an invitation, you can use the `addMember` function which can only be invoked on the server.

<APIMethod
  path="/organization/add-member"
  method="POST"
  isServerOnly
>
```ts
type addMember = {
    /**
     * The user Id which represents the user to be added as a member. If `null` is provided, then it's expected to provide session headers. 
     */
    userId?: string | null = "user-id"
    /**
     * The role(s) to assign to the new member. 
     */
    role: string | string[] = ["admin", "sale"]
    /**
     * An optional organization ID to pass. If not provided, will default to the user's active organization. 
     */
    organizationId?: string = "org-id"
    /**
     * An optional team ID to add the member to. 
     */
    teamId?: string = "team-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Leave Organization

     */
    organizationId: string = "organization-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>


## Access Control

The organization plugin providers a very flexible access control system. You can control the access of the user based on the role they have in the organization. You can define your own set of permissions based on the role of the user.

### Roles

By default, there are three roles in the organization:

`owner`: The user who created the organization by default. The owner has full control over the organization and can perform any action.

`admin`: Users with the admin role have full control over the organization except for deleting the organization or changing the owner.

`member`: Users with the member role have limited control over the organization. They can create projects, invite users, and manage projects they have created.

<Callout>
  A user can have multiple roles. Multiple roles are stored as string separated by comma (",").
</Callout>

### Permissions

By default, there are three resources, and these have two to three actions.

**organization**:

    `update` `delete`

**member**:

    `create` `update` `delete`

**invitation**:

    `create` `cancel`

The owner has full control over all the resources and actions. The admin has full control over all the resources except for deleting the organization or changing the owner. The member has no control over any of those actions other than reading the data.

### Custom Permissions

The plugin provides an easy way to define your own set of permissions for each role.

<Steps>
    <Step>
    #### Create Access Control

    You first need to create access controller by calling `createAccessControl` function and passing the statement object. The statement object should have the resource name as the key and the array of actions as the value.
    ```ts title="permissions.ts"
    import { createAccessControl } from "better-auth/plugins/access";

    /**
     * make sure to use `as const` so typescript can infer the type correctly
     */
    const statement = { // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create", "share", "update", "delete"], // [!code highlight]
    } as const; // [!code highlight]

    const ac = createAccessControl(statement); // [!code highlight]
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
    #### Create Roles

    Once you have created the access controller you can create roles with the permissions you have defined.

    ```ts title="permissions.ts"
    import { createAccessControl } from "better-auth/plugins/access";

    const statement = {
        project: ["create", "share", "update", "delete"],
    } as const;

    const ac = createAccessControl(statement);

    const member = ac.newRole({ // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create"], // [!code highlight]
    }); // [!code highlight]

    const admin = ac.newRole({ // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create", "update"], // [!code highlight]
    }); // [!code highlight]

    const owner = ac.newRole({ // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create", "update", "delete"], // [!code highlight]
    }); // [!code highlight]

    const myCustomRole = ac.newRole({ // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create", "update", "delete"], // [!code highlight]
        organization: ["update"], // [!code highlight]
    }); // [!code highlight]
    ```

      When you create custom roles for existing roles, the predefined permissions for those roles will be overridden. To add the existing permissions to the custom role, you need to import `defaultStatements` and merge it with your new statement, plus merge the roles' permissions set with the default roles.

    ```ts title="permissions.ts"
    import { createAccessControl } from "better-auth/plugins/access";
    import { defaultStatements, adminAc } from 'better-auth/plugins/organization/access'

    const statement = {
        ...defaultStatements, // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create", "share", "update", "delete"],
    } as const;

    const ac = createAccessControl(statement);

    const admin = ac.newRole({
        project: ["create", "update"],
        ...adminAc.statements, // [!code highlight]
    });
    ```

    </Step>

    <Step>
        #### Pass Roles to the Plugin

        Once you have created the roles you can pass them to the organization plugin both on the client and the server.

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins"
        import { ac, owner, admin, member } from "@/auth/permissions"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            plugins: [
                organization({
                    ac,
                    roles: {
                        owner,
                        admin,
                        member,
                        myCustomRole
                    }
                }),
            ],
        });
        ```

        You also need to pass the access controller and the roles to the client plugin.

        ```ts title="auth-client"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        import { organizationClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
        import { ac, owner, admin, member, myCustomRole } from "@/auth/permissions"

        export const authClient = createAuthClient({
            plugins: [
                organizationClient({
                    ac,
                    roles: {
                        owner,
                        admin,
                        member,
                        myCustomRole
                    }
                })
          ]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>


### Access Control Usage

**Has Permission**:

You can use the `hasPermission` action provided by the `api` to check the permission of the user.

```ts title="api.ts"
import { auth } from "@/auth";

await auth.api.hasPermission({
  headers: await headers(),
    body: {
      permissions: {
        project: ["create"] // This must match the structure in your access control
      }
    }
});

// You can also check multiple resource permissions at the same time
await auth.api.hasPermission({
  headers: await headers(),
    body: {
      permissions: {
        project: ["create"], // This must match the structure in your access control
        sale: ["create"]
      }
    }
});
```

If you want to check the permission of the user on the client from the server you can use the `hasPermission` function provided by the client.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const canCreateProject = await authClient.organization.hasPermission({
    permissions: {
        project: ["create"]
    }
})

// You can also check multiple resource permissions at the same time
const canCreateProjectAndCreateSale = await authClient.organization.hasPermission({
    permissions: {
        project: ["create"],
        sale: ["create"]
    }
})
```

**Check Role Permission**:

Once you have defined the roles and permissions to avoid checking the permission from the server you can use the `checkRolePermission` function provided by the client.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const canCreateProject = authClient.organization.checkRolePermission({
	permissions: {
		organization: ["delete"],
	},
	role: "admin",
});

// You can also check multiple resource permissions at the same time
const canCreateProjectAndCreateSale = authClient.organization.checkRolePermission({
	permissions: {
		organization: ["delete"],
    member: ["delete"]
	},
	role: "admin",
});
```

## Teams

Teams allow you to group members within an organization. The teams feature provides additional organization structure and can be used to manage permissions at a more granular level.

### Enabling Teams

To enable teams, pass the `teams` configuration option to both server and client plugins:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        organization({
            teams: {
                enabled: true,
                maximumTeams: 10, // Optional: limit teams per organization
                allowRemovingAllTeams: false // Optional: prevent removing the last team
            }
        })
    ]
})
```

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
import { organizationClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
    plugins: [
        organizationClient({
            teams: {
                enabled: true
            }
        })
    ]
})
```

        name?: string = "My new team name"
        /**
         * The organization ID which the team falls under.
         */
        organizationId?: string = "My new organization ID for this team"
        /**
         * The timestamp of when the team was created.
         */
        createdAt?: Date = new Date()
        /**
         * The timestamp of when the team was last updated.
         */
        updatedAt?: Date = new Date()
    }
}
```
</APIMethod>

    /**
     * The user which should be removed from the team.
     */
    userId: string = "user-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Team Permissions

Teams follow the organization's permission system. To manage teams, users need the following permissions:

- `team:create` - Create new teams
- `team:update` - Update team details
- `team:delete` - Remove teams

By default:
- Organization owners and admins can manage teams
- Regular members cannot create, update, or delete teams

### Team Configuration Options

The teams feature supports several configuration options:

- `maximumTeams`: Limit the number of teams per organization
  ```ts
  teams: {
    enabled: true,
    maximumTeams: 10 // Fixed number
    // OR
    maximumTeams: async ({ organizationId, session }, request) => {
      // Dynamic limit based on organization plan
      const plan = await getPlan(organizationId)
      return plan === 'pro' ? 20 : 5
    },
    maximumMembersPerTeam: 10 // Fixed number
    // OR
    maximumMembersPerTeam: async ({ teamId, session, organizationId }, request) => {
      // Dynamic limit based on team plan
      const plan = await getPlan(organizationId, teamId)
      return plan === 'pro' ? 50 : 10
    },
  }
  ```

- `allowRemovingAllTeams`: Control whether the last team can be removed
  ```ts
  teams: {
    enabled: true,
    allowRemovingAllTeams: false // Prevent removing the last team
  }
  ```

### Team Members

When inviting members to an organization, you can specify a team:

```ts
await authClient.organization.inviteMember({
    email: "user@example.com",
    role: "member",
    teamId: "team-id"
})
```

The invited member will be added to the specified team upon accepting the invitation.

### Database Schema

When teams are enabled, new `team` and `teamMember` tables are added to the database.

Table Name: `team`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "string",
      description: "Unique identifier for each team",
      isPrimaryKey: true
    },

      type: "Date",
      description: "Timestamp of when the team was created"
    },
    {
      name: "updatedAt",
      type: "Date",
      isOptional: true,
      description: "Timestamp of when the team was created"
    },
  ]}
/>

Table Name: `teamMember`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "string",
      description: "Unique identifier for each team member",
      isPrimaryKey: true
    },
    {
      name: "teamId",
      type: "string",
      description: "Unique identifier for each team",

      description: "The ID of the user",
      isForeignKey: true
    },
    {
      name: "createdAt",
      type: "Date",
      description: "Timestamp of when the team member was created"
    },
  ]}
/>

## Schema

The organization plugin adds the following tables to the database:

### Organization

Table Name: `organization`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "string",
      description: "Unique identifier for each organization",
      isPrimaryKey: true
    },
    {
      name: "name",
      type: "string",
      description: "The name of the organization"
    },
    {
      name: "slug",
      type: "string",
      description: "The slug of the organization"
    },
    {
      name: "logo",
      type: "string",
      description: "The logo of the organization",
      isOptional: true
    },
    {
      name: "metadata",
      type: "string",
      description: "Additional metadata for the organization",
      isOptional: true
    },
    {
      name: "createdAt",
      type: "Date",
      description: "Timestamp of when the organization was created"
    },
  ]}
  />

### Member

Table Name: `member`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "string",
      description: "Unique identifier for each member",
      isPrimaryKey: true
    },
    {
      name: "userId",
      type: "string",
      description: "The ID of the user",
      isForeignKey: true
    },
    {
      name: "organizationId",
      type: "string",
      description: "The ID of the organization",
      isForeignKey: true
    },
    {
      name: "role",
      type: "string",
      description: "The role of the user in the organization"
    },
    {
      name: "createdAt",
      type: "Date",
      description: "Timestamp of when the member was added to the organization"
    },
  ]}
  />

### Invitation

Table Name: `invitation`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "string",
      description: "Unique identifier for each invitation",
      isPrimaryKey: true
    },
    {
      name: "email",
      type: "string",
      description: "The email address of the user"
    },
    {
      name: "inviterId",
      type: "string",
      description: "The ID of the inviter",
      isForeignKey: true
    },
    {
      name: "organizationId",
      type: "string",
      description: "The ID of the organization",
      isForeignKey: true
    },
    {
      name: "role",
      type: "string",
      description: "The role of the user in the organization"
    },
    {
      name: "status",
      type: "string",
      description: "The status of the invitation"
    },
    {
      name: "expiresAt",
      type: "Date",
      description: "Timestamp of when the invitation expires"
    },
  ]}
  />

If teams are enabled, you need to add the following fields to the invitation table:

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    {
      name: "teamId",
      type: "string",
      description: "The ID of the team",
      isOptional: true
    },
  ]}
  />

### Session

Table Name: `session`

You need to add two more fields to the session table to store the active organization ID and the active team ID.

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    {
      name: "activeOrganizationId",
      type: "string",
      description: "The ID of the active organization",
      isOptional: true
    },
    {
      name: "activeTeamId",
      type: "string",
      description: "The ID of the active team",
      isOptional: true
    },
  ]}
  />

### Teams (optional)

Table Name: `team`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "string",
      description: "Unique identifier for each team",
      isPrimaryKey: true
    },
    {
      name: "name",
      type: "string",
      description: "The name of the team"
    },
    {
      name: "organizationId",
      type: "string",
      description: "The ID of the organization",
      isForeignKey: true
    },
    {
      name: "createdAt",
      type: "Date",
      description: "Timestamp of when the team was created"
    },
    {
      name: "updatedAt",
      type: "Date",
      isOptional: true,
      description: "Timestamp of when the team was created"
    },
  ]}
  />

Table Name: `teamMember`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "string",
      description: "Unique identifier for each team member",
      isPrimaryKey: true
    },
    {
      name: "teamId",
      type: "string",
      description: "Unique identifier for each team",
      isForeignKey: true
    },
    {
      name: "userId",
      type: "string",
      description: "The ID of the user",
      isForeignKey: true
    },
    {
      name: "createdAt",
      type: "Date",
      description: "Timestamp of when the team member was created"
    },
  ]}
  />

Table Name: `invitation`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    {
      name: "teamId",
      type: "string",
      description: "The ID of the team",
      isOptional: true
    },
  ]}
  />

### Customizing the Schema

To change the schema table name or fields, you can pass `schema` option to the organization plugin.

```ts title="auth.ts"
const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    organization({
      schema: {
        organization: {
          modelName: "organizations",  //map the organization table to organizations
          fields: {
            name: "title" //map the name field to title
          },
          additionalFields: {
            // Add a new field to the organization table
            myCustomField: {
              type: "string",
              input: true,
              required: false
            }
          }
        }
      }
    })
  ]
})
```

#### Additional Fields

Starting with [Better Auth v1.3](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/releases/tag/v1.3.0), you can easily add custom fields to the `organization`, `invitation`, `member`, and `team` tables.

When you add extra fields to a model, the relevant API endpoints will automatically accept and return these new properties. For instance, if you add a custom field to the `organization` table, the `createOrganization` endpoint will include this field in its request and response payloads as needed.

```ts title="auth.ts"
const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    organization({
      schema: {
        organization: {
          additionalFields: {
            myCustomField: { // [!code highlight]
              type: "string", // [!code highlight]
              input: true, // [!code highlight]
              required: false // [!code highlight]
            } // [!code highlight]
          }
        }
      }
    })
  ]
})
```

For inferring the additional fields, you can use the `inferOrgAdditionalFields` function. This function will infer the additional fields from the auth object type.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import { inferOrgAdditionalFields, organizationClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins";
import type { auth } from "@/auth" // import the auth object type only

const client = createAuthClient({
    plugins: [organizationClient({
        schema: inferOrgAdditionalFields<typeof auth>()
    })]
})
```

if you can't import the auth object type, you can use the `inferOrgAdditionalFields` function without the generic. This function will infer the additional fields from the schema object.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"

const client = createAuthClient({
    plugins: [organizationClient({
        schema: inferOrgAdditionalFields({
          organization: { // [!code highlight]
            additionalFields: {
              newField: { // [!code highlight]
                type: "string", // [!code highlight]
              }, // [!code highlight]
            },
          },
        })
    })]
})

//example usage
await client.organization.create({
    name: "Test",
    slug: "test",
    newField: "123", //this should be allowed
    //@ts-expect-error - this field is not available
    unavalibleField: "123", //this should be not allowed
})
```

## Options

**allowUserToCreateOrganization**: `boolean` | `((user: User) => Promise<boolean> | boolean)` - A function that determines whether a user can create an organization. By default, it's `true`. You can set it to `false` to restrict users from creating organizations.

**organizationLimit**: `number` | `((user: User) => Promise<boolean> | boolean)` - The maximum number of organizations allowed for a user. By default, it's `5`. You can set it to any number you want or a function that returns a boolean.

**creatorRole**: `admin | owner` - The role of the user who creates the organization. By default, it's `owner`. You can set it to `admin`.

**membershipLimit**: `number` - The maximum number of members allowed in an organization. By default, it's `100`. You can set it to any number you want.

**sendInvitationEmail**: `async (data) => Promise<void>` - A function that sends an invitation email to the user.

**invitationExpiresIn** : `number` - How long the invitation link is valid for in seconds. By default, it's 48 hours (2 days).

**cancelPendingInvitationsOnReInvite**: `boolean` - Whether to cancel pending invitations if the user is already invited to the organization. By default, it's `false`.

**invitationLimit**: `number` | `((user: User) => Promise<boolean> | boolean)` - The maximum number of invitations allowed for a user. By default, it's `100`. You can set it to any number you want or a function that returns a boolean.

title: Passkey
description: Passkey
---

Passkeys are a secure, passwordless authentication method using cryptographic key pairs, supported by WebAuthn and FIDO2 standards in web browsers. They replace passwords with unique key pairs: a private key stored on the user's device and a public key shared with the website. Users can log in using biometrics, PINs, or security keys, providing strong, phishing-resistant authentication without traditional passwords.

The passkey plugin implementation is powered by [SimpleWebAuthn](https://simplewebauthn.dev/) behind the scenes.

## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Add the plugin to your auth config
        To add the passkey plugin to your auth config, you need to import the plugin and pass it to the `plugins` option of the auth instance.

        **Options**

        `rpID`: A unique identifier for your website. 'localhost' is okay for local dev

        `rpName`: Human-readable title for your website

        `origin`: The URL at which registrations and authentications should occur. `http://localhost` and `http://localhost:PORT` are also valid. Do **NOT** include any trailing /

        `authenticatorSelection`: Allows customization of WebAuthn authenticator selection criteria. Leave unspecified for default settings.
            - `authenticatorAttachment`: Specifies the type of authenticator
                - `platform`: Authenticator is attached to the platform (e.g., fingerprint reader)
                - `cross-platform`: Authenticator is not attached to the platform (e.g., security key)
                - Default: `not set` (both platform and cross-platform allowed, with platform preferred)
            - `residentKey`: Determines credential storage behavior.
                - `required`: User MUST store credentials on the authenticator (highest security)
                - `preferred`: Encourages credential storage but not mandatory
                - `discouraged`: No credential storage required (fastest experience)
                - Default: `preferred`
            - `userVerification`: Controls biometric/PIN verification during authentication:
                - `required`: User MUST verify identity (highest security)
                - `preferred`: Verification encouraged but not mandatory
                - `discouraged`: No verification required (fastest experience)
                - Default: `preferred`
            
           
        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { passkey } from "better-auth/plugins/passkey" // [!code highlight]

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
                passkey(), // [!code highlight]
            ], // [!code highlight]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
      <Step>
        ### Migrate the database

        Run the migration or generate the schema to add the necessary fields and tables to the database.

        <Tabs items={["migrate", "generate"]}>
            <Tab value="migrate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli migrate
            ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="generate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli generate
            ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
        See the [Schema](#schema) section to add the fields manually.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Add the client plugin

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        import { passkeyClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

        export const authClient = createAuthClient({
            plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
                passkeyClient() // [!code highlight]
            ] // [!code highlight]
        })
        ```
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Usage

### Add/Register a passkey

To add or register a passkey make sure a user is authenticated and then call the `passkey.addPasskey` function provided by the client.

<APIMethod path="/passkey/add-passkey" method="POST" isClientOnly>
```ts
type addPasskey = {
    /**
     * An optional name to label the authenticator account being registered. If not provided, it will default to the user's email address or user ID
    */
    name?: string = "example-passkey-name"
    /**
     * You can also specify the type of authenticator you want to register. Default behavior allows both platform and cross-platform passkeys
    */
    authenticatorAttachment?: "platform" | "cross-platform" = "cross-platform"
}
```
</APIMethod>


### Sign in with a passkey

To sign in with a passkey you can use the `signIn.passkey` method. This will prompt the user to sign in with their passkey.


<APIMethod path="/sign-in/passkey" method="POST" isClientOnly>
```ts
type signInPasskey = {
    /**
     * The email of the user to sign in.
     */
    email: string = "example@gmail.com"
    /**
     * Browser autofill, a.k.a. Conditional UI. Read more: https://simplewebauthn.dev/docs/packages/browser#browser-autofill-aka-conditional-ui
    */
    autoFill?: boolean = true
    /**
     * The URL to redirect to after the user has signed in.
    */
    callbackURL?: string = "/dashboard"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### List passkeys

You can list all of the passkeys for the authenticated user by calling `passkey.listUserPasskeys`:

<APIMethod
  path="/passkey/list-user-passkeys"
  method="GET"
  requireSession
  resultVariable="passkeys"
>
```ts
type listPasskeys = {
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Deleting passkeys

You can delete a passkey by calling `passkey.delete` and providing the passkey ID.

<APIMethod
  path="/passkey/delete-passkey"
  method="POST"
  requireSession
>
```ts
type deletePasskey = {
    /**
     * The ID of the passkey to delete. 
     */
    id: string = "some-passkey-id"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Updating passkey names

<APIMethod
  path="/passkey/update-passkey"
  method="POST"
  requireSession
>
```ts
type updatePasskey = {
    /**
     * The ID of the passkey which you want to update.
     */
    id: string = "id of passkey"
    /**
     * The new name which the passkey will be updated to. 
     */
    name: string = "my-new-passkey-name"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Conditional UI

The plugin supports conditional UI, which allows the browser to autofill the passkey if the user has already registered a passkey.

There are two requirements for conditional UI to work:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        #### Update input fields

        Add the `autocomplete` attribute with the value `webauthn` to your input fields. You can add this attribute to multiple input fields, but at least one is required for conditional UI to work.

        The `webauthn` value should also be the last entry of the `autocomplete` attribute.

        ```html
        <label for="name">Username:</label>
        <input type="text" name="name" autocomplete="username webauthn">
        <label for="password">Password:</label>
        <input type="password" name="password" autocomplete="current-password webauthn">
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Preload the passkeys

        When your component mounts, you can preload the user's passkeys by calling the `authClient.signIn.passkey` method with the `autoFill` option set to `true`.

        To prevent unnecessary calls, we will also add a check to see if the browser supports conditional UI.

        <Tabs items={["React"]}>
            <Tab value="React">
            ```ts
            useEffect(() => {
               if (!PublicKeyCredential.isConditionalMediationAvailable ||
                   !PublicKeyCredential.isConditionalMediationAvailable()) {
                 return;
               }

              void authClient.signIn.passkey({ autoFill: true })
            }, [])
            ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

    </Step>

   </Steps>

Depending on the browser, a prompt will appear to autofill the passkey. If the user has multiple passkeys, they can select the one they want to use.

Some browsers also require the user to first interact with the input field before the autofill prompt appears.

### Debugging

To test your passkey implementation you can use [emulated authenticators](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/webauthn). This way you can test the registration and sign-in process without even owning a physical device.

## Schema

The plugin require a new table in the database to store passkey data.

Table Name: `passkey`

<DatabaseTable
    fields={[
        { 
            name: "id", 
            type: "string", 
            description: "Unique identifier for each passkey",
            isPrimaryKey: true
        },
        {
            name: "name",
            type: "string",
            description: "The name of the passkey",
            isOptional: true

            type: "number", 
            description: "The counter of the passkey",
        },
        {
            name: "deviceType",
            type: "string",
            description: "The type of device used to register the passkey",
        },
        {
            name: "backedUp",
            type: "boolean",
            description: "Whether the passkey is backed up",
        },
        {
            name: "transports",
            type: "string",
            description: "The transports used to register the passkey",
        },

            name: "createdAt", 
            type: "Date", 
            description: "The time when the passkey was created",
        },
        {
                name: "aaguid",
                type: "string",
                description: "Authenticator's Attestation GUID indicating the type of the authenticator",
                isOptional: true
        },
    ]}
    />

## Options

**rpID**: A unique identifier for your website. 'localhost' is okay for local dev.

**rpName**: Human-readable title for your website.

**origin**: The URL at which registrations and authentications should occur. `http://localhost` and `http://localhost:PORT` are also valid. Do NOT include any trailing /.

**authenticatorSelection**: Allows customization of WebAuthn authenticator selection criteria. When unspecified, both platform and cross-platform authenticators are allowed with `preferred` settings for `residentKey` and `userVerification`.

**aaguid**: (optional) Authenticator Attestation GUID. This is a unique identifier for the passkey provider (device or authenticator type) and can be used to identify the type of passkey device used during registration or authentication.

The phone number plugin extends the authentication system by allowing users to sign in and sign up using their phone number. It includes OTP (One-Time Password) functionality to verify phone numbers.

## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Add Plugin to the server

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { phoneNumber } from "better-auth/plugins"

        const auth = betterAuth({
            plugins: [ 
                phoneNumber({  // [!code highlight]
                    sendOTP: ({ phoneNumber, code }, request) => { // [!code highlight]
                        // Implement sending OTP code via SMS // [!code highlight]
                    } // [!code highlight]
                }) // [!code highlight]
            ] 
        })
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Migrate the database

        Run the migration or generate the schema to add the necessary fields and tables to the database.

        <Tabs items={["migrate", "generate"]}>
            <Tab value="migrate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli migrate
            ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="generate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli generate
            ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
        See the [Schema](#schema) section to add the fields manually.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Add the client plugin

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        import { phoneNumberClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

        const authClient =  createAuthClient({
            plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
                phoneNumberClient() // [!code highlight]
            ] // [!code highlight]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

### Send OTP for Verification

To send an OTP to a user's phone number for verification, you can use the `sendVerificationCode` endpoint.

<APIMethod path="/phone-number/send-otp" method="POST">
```ts
type sendPhoneNumberOTP = {
    /**
     * Phone number to send OTP. 
     */
    phoneNumber: string = "+1234567890"
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Verify Phone Number

After the OTP is sent, users can verify their phone number by providing the code.

<APIMethod path="/phone-number/verify" method="POST">
```ts
type verifyPhoneNumber = {
    /**
     * Phone number to verify. 
     */
    phoneNumber: string = "+1234567890"
    /**
     * OTP code. 
     */
    code: string = "123456"
    /**
     * Disable session creation after verification. 
     */
    disableSession?: boolean = false
    /**
     * Check if there is a session and update the phone number. 
     */
    updatePhoneNumber?: boolean = true
}
```
</APIMethod>

<Callout>
When the phone number is verified, the `phoneNumberVerified` field in the user table is set to `true`. If `disableSession` is not set to `true`, a session is created for the user. Additionally, if `callbackOnVerification` is provided, it will be called.
</Callout>

### Allow Sign-Up with Phone Number

To allow users to sign up using their phone number, you can pass `signUpOnVerification` option to your plugin configuration. It requires you to pass `getTempEmail` function to generate a temporary email for the user.

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        phoneNumber({
            sendOTP: ({ phoneNumber, code }, request) => {
                // Implement sending OTP code via SMS
            },
            signUpOnVerification: {
                getTempEmail: (phoneNumber) => {
                    return `${phoneNumber}@my-site.com`
                },
                //optionally, you can also pass `getTempName` function to generate a temporary name for the user
                getTempName: (phoneNumber) => {
                    return phoneNumber //by default, it will use the phone number as the name
                }
            }
        })
    ]
})
```

### Sign In with Phone Number

In addition to signing in a user using send-verify flow, you can also use phone number as an identifier and sign in a user using phone number and password.

<APIMethod path="/sign-in/phone-number" method="POST">
```ts
type signInPhoneNumber = {
    /**
     * Phone number to sign in. 
     */
    phoneNumber: string = "+1234567890"
    /**
     * Password to use for sign in. 
     */
    password: string
    /**
     * Remember the session. 
     */
    rememberMe?: boolean = true
}
```
</APIMethod>

### Update Phone Number

Updating phone number uses the same process as verifying a phone number. The user will receive an OTP code to verify the new phone number.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
await authClient.phoneNumber.sendOtp({
    phoneNumber: "+1234567890" // New phone number
})
```

Then verify the new phone number with the OTP code. 

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const isVerified = await authClient.phoneNumber.verify({
    phoneNumber: "+1234567890",
    code: "123456",
    updatePhoneNumber: true // Set to true to update the phone number [!code highlight]
})
```

If a user session exist the phone number will be updated automatically.


### Disable Session Creation

By default, the plugin creates a session for the user after verifying the phone number. You can disable this behavior by passing `disableSession: true` to the `verify` method.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const isVerified = await authClient.phoneNumber.verify({
    phoneNumber: "+1234567890",
    code: "123456",
    disableSession: true // [!code highlight]
})
```

### Request Password Reset

To initiate a request password reset flow using `phoneNumber`, you can start by calling `requestPasswordReset` on the client to send an OTP code to the user's phone number.

<APIMethod path="/phone-number/request-password-reset" method="POST">
```ts
type requestPasswordResetPhoneNumber = {
    /**
     * The phone number which is associated with the user. 
     */
    phoneNumber: string = "+1234567890"
}
```
</APIMethod>

Then, you can reset the password by calling `resetPassword` on the client with the OTP code and the new password.

<APIMethod path="/phone-number/reset-password" method="POST">
```ts
type resetPasswordPhoneNumber = {
    /**
     * The one time password to reset the password. 
     */
    otp: string = "123456"
    /**
     * The phone number to the account which intends to reset the password for. 
     */
    phoneNumber: string = "+1234567890"
    /**
     * The new password. 
     */
    newPassword: string = "new-and-secure-password"
}
```
</APIMethod>

## Options

- `otpLength`: The length of the OTP code to be generated. Default is `6`.
- `sendOTP`: A function that sends the OTP code to the user's phone number. It takes the phone number and the OTP code as arguments.
- `expiresIn`: The time in seconds after which the OTP code expires. Default is `300` seconds.
- `callbackOnVerification`: A function that is called after the phone number is verified. It takes the phone number and the user object as the first argument and a request object as the second argument.
```ts
export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        phoneNumber({
            sendOTP: ({ phoneNumber, code }, request) => {
                // Implement sending OTP code via SMS
            },
            callbackOnVerification: async ({ phoneNumber, user }, request) => {
                // Implement callback after phone number verification
            }
        })
    ]
})
```
- `sendPasswordResetOTP`: A function that sends the OTP code to the user's phone number for password reset. It takes the phone number and the OTP code as arguments.
- `phoneNumberValidator`: A custom function to validate the phone number. It takes the phone number as an argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the phone number is valid.
- `signUpOnVerification`: An object with the following properties:
    - `getTempEmail`: A function that generates a temporary email for the user. It takes the phone number as an argument and returns the temporary email.
    - `getTempName`: A function that generates a temporary name for the user. It takes the phone number as an argument and returns the temporary name.

- `requireVerification`: When enabled, users cannot sign in with their phone number until it has been verified. If an unverified user attempts to sign in, the server will respond with a 401 error (PHONE_NUMBER_NOT_VERIFIED) and automatically trigger an OTP send to start the verification process.
    
## Schema

The plugin requires 2 fields to be added to the user table 

### User Table
<DatabaseTable
    fields={[
        { 
            name: "phoneNumber", 
            type: "string", 
            description: "The phone number of the user",
            isUnique: true,
            isOptional: true
        },
        { 
            name: "phoneNumberVerified", 
            type: "boolean", 
            description: "Whether the phone number is verified or not",
            defaultValue: false,
            isOptional: true
        },
    ]}
    />

### OTP Verification Attempts

The phone number plugin includes a built-in protection against brute force attacks by limiting the number of verification attempts for each OTP code.

```typescript
phoneNumber({
  allowedAttempts: 3, // default is 3
  // ... other options
})
```

When a user exceeds the allowed number of verification attempts:
- The OTP code is automatically deleted
- Further verification attempts will return a 403 (Forbidden) status with "Too many attempts" message
- The user will need to request a new OTP code to continue

Example error response after exceeding attempts:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "status": 403,
    "message": "Too many attempts"
  }
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
When receiving a 403 status, prompt the user to request a new OTP code

```typescript
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { polar, checkout, portal, usage, webhooks } from "@polar-sh/better-auth";
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

const polarClient = new Polar({
    accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
    // Use 'sandbox' if you're using the Polar Sandbox environment
    // Remember that access tokens, products, etc. are completely separated between environments.
    // Access tokens obtained in Production are for instance not usable in the Sandbox environment.
    server: 'sandbox'
});

const auth = betterAuth({
    // ... Better Auth config
    plugins: [
        polar({
            client: polarClient,
            createCustomerOnSignUp: true,
            use: [
                checkout({
                    products: [
                        {
                            productId: "123-456-789", // ID of Product from Polar Dashboard
                            slug: "pro" // Custom slug for easy reference in Checkout URL, e.g. /checkout/pro
                        }
                    ],
                    successUrl: "/success?checkout_id={CHECKOUT_ID}",
                    authenticatedUsersOnly: true
                }),
                portal(),
                usage(),
                webhooks({
                    secret: process.env.POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
                    onCustomerStateChanged: (payload) => // Triggered when anything regarding a customer changes
                    onOrderPaid: (payload) => // Triggered when an order was paid (purchase, subscription renewal, etc.)
                    ...  // Over 25 granular webhook handlers
                    onPayload: (payload) => // Catch-all for all events
                })
            ],
        })
    ]
});
```

### Configuring BetterAuth Client

You will be using the BetterAuth Client to interact with the Polar functionalities.

```typescript
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";
import { polarClient } from "@polar-sh/better-auth";
import { organizationClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins";

// This is all that is needed
// All Polar plugins, etc. should be attached to the server-side BetterAuth config
export const authClient = createAuthClient({
  plugins: [polarClient()],
});
```

## Configuration Options

```typescript
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import {
  polar,
  checkout,
  portal,
  usage,
  webhooks,
} from "@polar-sh/better-auth";
import { Polar } from "@polar-sh/sdk";

const polarClient = new Polar({
  accessToken: process.env.POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN,
  // Use 'sandbox' if you're using the Polar Sandbox environment
  // Remember that access tokens, products, etc. are completely separated between environments.
  // Access tokens obtained in Production are for instance not usable in the Sandbox environment.
  server: "sandbox",
});

const auth = betterAuth({
  // ... Better Auth config
  plugins: [
    polar({
      client: polarClient,
      createCustomerOnSignUp: true,
      getCustomerCreateParams: ({ user }, request) => ({
        metadata: {
          myCustomProperty: 123,
        },
      }),
      use: [
        // This is where you add Polar plugins
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Required Options

- `client`: Polar SDK client instance

### Optional Options

- `createCustomerOnSignUp`: Automatically create a Polar customer when a user signs up
- `getCustomerCreateParams`: Custom function to provide additional customer creation metadata

### Customers

When `createCustomerOnSignUp` is enabled, a new Polar Customer is automatically created when a new User is added in the Better-Auth Database.

All new customers are created with an associated `externalId`, which is the ID of your User in the Database. This allows us to skip any Polar to User mapping in your Database.

## Checkout Plugin

To support checkouts in your app, simply pass the Checkout plugin to the use-property.

```typescript
import { polar, checkout } from "@polar-sh/better-auth";

const auth = betterAuth({
    // ... Better Auth config
    plugins: [
        polar({
            ...
            use: [
                checkout({
                    // Optional field - will make it possible to pass a slug to checkout instead of Product ID
                    products: [ { productId: "123-456-789", slug: "pro" } ],
                    // Relative URL to return to when checkout is successfully completed
                    successUrl: "/success?checkout_id={CHECKOUT_ID}",
                    // Wheather you want to allow unauthenticated checkout sessions or not
                    authenticatedUsersOnly: true
                })
            ],
        })
    ]
});
```

When checkouts are enabled, you're able to initialize Checkout Sessions using the checkout-method on the BetterAuth Client. This will redirect the user to the Product Checkout.

```typescript
await authClient.checkout({
  // Any Polar Product ID can be passed here
  products: ["e651f46d-ac20-4f26-b769-ad088b123df2"],
  // Or, if you setup "products" in the Checkout Config, you can pass the slug
  slug: "pro",
});
```

Checkouts will automatically carry the authenticated User as the customer to the checkout. Email-address will be "locked-in".

If `authenticatedUsersOnly` is `false` - then it will be possible to trigger checkout sessions without any associated customer.

### Organization Support

This plugin supports the Organization plugin. If you pass the organization ID to the Checkout referenceId, you will be able to keep track of purchases made from organization members.

```typescript
const organizationId = (await authClient.organization.list())?.data?.[0]?.id,

await authClient.checkout({
    // Any Polar Product ID can be passed here
    products: ["e651f46d-ac20-4f26-b769-ad088b123df2"],
    // Or, if you setup "products" in the Checkout Config, you can pass the slug
    slug: 'pro',
    // Reference ID will be saved as `referenceId` in the metadata of the checkout, order & subscription object
    referenceId: organizationId
});
```

## Portal Plugin

A plugin which enables customer management of their purchases, orders and subscriptions.

```typescript
import { polar, checkout, portal } from "@polar-sh/better-auth";

const auth = betterAuth({
    // ... Better Auth config
    plugins: [
        polar({
            ...
            use: [
                checkout(...),
                portal()
            ],
        })
    ]
});
```

The portal-plugin gives the BetterAuth Client a set of customer management methods, scoped under `authClient.customer`.

### Customer Portal Management

The following method will redirect the user to the Polar Customer Portal, where they can see orders, purchases, subscriptions, benefits, etc.

```typescript
await authClient.customer.portal();
```

### Customer State

The portal plugin also adds a convenient state-method for retrieving the general Customer State.

```typescript
const { data: customerState } = await authClient.customer.state();
```

The customer state object contains:

- All the data about the customer.
- The list of their active subscriptions
  - Note: This does not include subscriptions done by a parent organization. See the subscription list-method below for more information.
- The list of their granted benefits.
- The list of their active meters, with their current balance.

Thus, with that single object, you have all the required information to check if you should provision access to your service or not.

[You can learn more about the Polar Customer State in the Polar Docs](https://docs.polar.sh/integrate/customer-state).

### Benefits, Orders & Subscriptions

The portal plugin adds 3 convenient methods for listing benefits, orders & subscriptions relevant to the authenticated user/customer.

[All of these methods use the Polar CustomerPortal APIs](https://docs.polar.sh/api-reference/customer-portal)

#### Benefits

This method only lists granted benefits for the authenticated user/customer.

```typescript
const { data: benefits } = await authClient.customer.benefits.list({
  query: {
    page: 1,
    limit: 10,
  },
});
```

#### Orders

This method lists orders like purchases and subscription renewals for the authenticated user/customer.

```typescript
const { data: orders } = await authClient.customer.orders.list({
  query: {
    page: 1,
    limit: 10,
    productBillingType: "one_time", // or 'recurring'
  },
});
```

#### Subscriptions

This method lists the subscriptions associated with authenticated user/customer.

```typescript
const { data: subscriptions } = await authClient.customer.subscriptions.list({
  query: {
    page: 1,
    limit: 10,
    active: true,
  },
});
```

**Important** - Organization Support

This will **not** return subscriptions made by a parent organization to the authenticated user.

However, you can pass a `referenceId` to this method. This will return all subscriptions associated with that referenceId instead of subscriptions associated with the user.

So in order to figure out if a user should have access, pass the user's organization ID to see if there is an active subscription for that organization.

```typescript
const organizationId = (await authClient.organization.list())?.data?.[0]?.id,

const { data: subscriptions } = await authClient.customer.orders.list({
    query: {
	    page: 1,
		limit: 10,
		active: true,
        referenceId: organizationId
    },
});

const userShouldHaveAccess = subscriptions.some(
    sub => // Your logic to check subscription product or whatever.
)
```

## Usage Plugin

A simple plugin for Usage Based Billing.

```typescript
import { polar, checkout, portal, usage } from "@polar-sh/better-auth";

const auth = betterAuth({
    // ... Better Auth config
    plugins: [
        polar({
            ...
            use: [
                checkout(...),
                portal(),
                usage()
            ],
        })
    ]
});
```

### Event Ingestion

Polar's Usage Based Billing builds entirely on event ingestion. Ingest events from your application, create Meters to represent that usage, and add metered prices to Products to charge for it.

[Learn more about Usage Based Billing in the Polar Docs.](https://docs.polar.sh/features/usage-based-billing/introduction)

```typescript
const { data: ingested } = await authClient.usage.ingest({
  event: "file-uploads",
  metadata: {
    uploadedFiles: 12,
  },
});
```

The authenticated user is automatically associated with the ingested event.

### Customer Meters

A simple method for listing the authenticated user's Usage Meters, or as we call them, Customer Meters.

Customer Meter's contains all information about their consumtion on your defined meters.

- Customer Information
- Meter Information
- Customer Meter Information
  - Consumed Units
  - Credited Units
  - Balance

```typescript
const { data: customerMeters } = await authClient.usage.meters.list({
  query: {
    page: 1,
    limit: 10,
  },
});
```

## Webhooks Plugin

The Webhooks plugin can be used to capture incoming events from your Polar organization.

```typescript
import { polar, webhooks } from "@polar-sh/better-auth";

const auth = betterAuth({
    // ... Better Auth config
    plugins: [
        polar({
            ...
            use: [
                webhooks({
                    secret: process.env.POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
                    onCustomerStateChanged: (payload) => // Triggered when anything regarding a customer changes
                    onOrderPaid: (payload) => // Triggered when an order was paid (purchase, subscription renewal, etc.)
                    ...  // Over 25 granular webhook handlers
                    onPayload: (payload) => // Catch-all for all events
                })
            ],
        })
    ]
});
```

Configure a Webhook endpoint in your Polar Organization Settings page. Webhook endpoint is configured at /polar/webhooks.

Add the secret to your environment.

```bash
# .env
POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...
```

The plugin supports handlers for all Polar webhook events:

- `onPayload` - Catch-all handler for any incoming Webhook event
- `onCheckoutCreated` - Triggered when a checkout is created
- `onCheckoutUpdated` - Triggered when a checkout is updated
- `onOrderCreated` - Triggered when an order is created
- `onOrderPaid` - Triggered when an order is paid
- `onOrderRefunded` - Triggered when an order is refunded
- `onRefundCreated` - Triggered when a refund is created
- `onRefundUpdated` - Triggered when a refund is updated
- `onSubscriptionCreated` - Triggered when a subscription is created
- `onSubscriptionUpdated` - Triggered when a subscription is updated
- `onSubscriptionActive` - Triggered when a subscription becomes active
- `onSubscriptionCanceled` - Triggered when a subscription is canceled
- `onSubscriptionRevoked` - Triggered when a subscription is revoked
- `onSubscriptionUncanceled` - Triggered when a subscription cancellation is reversed
- `onProductCreated` - Triggered when a product is created
- `onProductUpdated` - Triggered when a product is updated
- `onOrganizationUpdated` - Triggered when an organization is updated
- `onBenefitCreated` - Triggered when a benefit is created
- `onBenefitUpdated` - Triggered when a benefit is updated
- `onBenefitGrantCreated` - Triggered when a benefit grant is created
- `onBenefitGrantUpdated` - Triggered when a benefit grant is updated
- `onBenefitGrantRevoked` - Triggered when a benefit grant is revoked
- `onCustomerCreated` - Triggered when a customer is created
- `onCustomerUpdated` - Triggered when a customer is updated
- `onCustomerDeleted` - Triggered when a customer is deleted
- `onCustomerStateChanged` - Triggered when a customer is created

title: Sign In With Ethereum (SIWE)
description: Sign in with Ethereum plugin for Better Auth
---

The Sign in with Ethereum (SIWE) plugin allows users to authenticate using their Ethereum wallets following the [ERC-4361 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361). This plugin provides flexibility by allowing you to implement your own message verification and nonce generation logic.

## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Add the Server Plugin

        Add the SIWE plugin to your auth configuration:

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
        import { siwe } from "better-auth/plugins";

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            plugins: [
                siwe({
                    domain: "example.com",
                    emailDomainName: "example.com", // optional
                    anonymous: false, // optional, default is true
                    getNonce: async () => {
                        // Implement your nonce generation logic here
                        return "your-secure-random-nonce";
                    },
                    verifyMessage: async (args) => {
                        // Implement your SIWE message verification logic here
                        // This should verify the signature against the message
                        return true; // return true if signature is valid
                    },
                    ensLookup: async (args) => {
                        // Optional: Implement ENS lookup for user names and avatars
                        return {
                            name: "user.eth",
                            avatar: "https://example.com/avatar.png"
                        };
                    },
                }),
            ],
        });
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Migrate the database

        Run the migration or generate the schema to add the necessary fields and tables to the database.

        <Tabs items={["migrate", "generate"]}>
            <Tab value="migrate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli migrate
            ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="generate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli generate
            ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
        See the [Schema](#schema) section to add the fields manually.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Add the Client Plugin

        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
        import { siweClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins";

        export const authClient = createAuthClient({
            plugins: [siweClient()],
        });
        ```
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Usage

### Generate a Nonce

Before signing a SIWE message, you need to generate a nonce for the wallet address:

```ts title="generate-nonce.ts"
const { data, error } = await authClient.siwe.nonce({
  walletAddress: "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678",
  chainId: 1, // optional, defaults to 1 (Ethereum mainnet)
});

if (data) {
  console.log("Nonce:", data.nonce);
}
```

### Sign In with Ethereum

After generating a nonce and creating a SIWE message, verify the signature to authenticate:

```ts title="sign-in-siwe.ts"
const { data, error } = await authClient.siwe.verify({
  message: "Your SIWE message string",
  signature: "0x...", // The signature from the user's wallet
  walletAddress: "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678",
  chainId: 1, // optional, defaults to 1
  email: "user@example.com", // optional, required if anonymous is false
});

if (data) {
  console.log("Authentication successful:", data.user);
}
```

## Configuration Options

### Server Options

The SIWE plugin accepts the following configuration options:

- **domain**: The domain name of your application (required for SIWE message generation)
- **emailDomainName**: The email domain name for creating user accounts when not using anonymous mode. Defaults to the domain from your base URL
- **anonymous**: Whether to allow anonymous sign-ins without requiring an email. Default is `true`
- **getNonce**: Function to generate a unique nonce for each sign-in attempt. You must implement this function to return a cryptographically secure random string. Must return a `Promise<string>`
- **verifyMessage**: Function to verify the signed SIWE message. Receives message details and should return `Promise<boolean>`
- **ensLookup**: Optional function to lookup ENS names and avatars for Ethereum addresses

### Client Options

The SIWE client plugin doesn't require any configuration options, but you can pass them if needed for future extensibility:

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import { siweClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins";

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
  plugins: [
    siweClient({
      // Optional client configuration can go here
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Schema

The SIWE plugin adds a `walletAddress` table to store user wallet associations:

| Field     | Type    | Description                               |
| --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| id        | string  | Primary key                               |
| userId    | string  | Reference to user.id                      |
| address   | string  | Ethereum wallet address                   |
| chainId   | number  | Chain ID (e.g., 1 for Ethereum mainnet)   |
| isPrimary | boolean | Whether this is the user's primary wallet |
| createdAt | date    | Creation timestamp                        |

## Example Implementation

Here's a complete example showing how to implement SIWE authentication:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { siwe } from "better-auth/plugins";
import { generateRandomString } from "better-auth/crypto";
import { verifyMessage, createPublicClient, http } from "viem";
import { mainnet } from "viem/chains";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: {
    // your database configuration
  },
  plugins: [
    siwe({
      domain: "myapp.com",
      emailDomainName: "myapp.com",
      anonymous: false,
      getNonce: async () => {
        // Generate a cryptographically secure random nonce
        return generateRandomString(32);
      },
      verifyMessage: async ({ message, signature, address }) => {
        try {
          // Verify the signature using viem (recommended)
          const isValid = await verifyMessage({
            address: address as `0x${string}`,
            message,
            signature: signature as `0x${string}`,
          });
          return isValid;
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("SIWE verification failed:", error);
          return false;
        }
      },
      ensLookup: async ({ walletAddress }) => {
        try {
          // Optional: lookup ENS name and avatar using viem
          // You can use viem's ENS utilities here
          const client = createPublicClient({
            chain: mainnet,
            transport: http(),
          });

          const ensName = await client.getEnsName({
            address: walletAddress as `0x${string}`,
          });

          const ensAvatar = ensName
            ? await client.getEnsAvatar({
                name: ensName,
              })
            : null;

          return {
            name: ensName || walletAddress,
            avatar: ensAvatar || "",
          };
        } catch {
          return {
            name: walletAddress,
            avatar: "",
          };
        }
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

    <Step>
        ### Add the plugin to your auth config

        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { stripe } from "@better-auth/stripe"
        import Stripe from "stripe"

        const stripeClient = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!, {
            apiVersion: "2025-02-24.acacia",
        })

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            // ... your existing config
            plugins: [
                stripe({
                    stripeClient,
                    stripeWebhookSecret: process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET!,
                    createCustomerOnSignUp: true,
                })
            ]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Add the client plugin

        export const client = createAuthClient({
            // ... your existing config
            plugins: [
                stripeClient({
                    subscription: true //if you want to enable subscription management
                })
            ]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Migrate the database

        Run the migration or generate the schema to add the necessary tables to the database.

        <Tabs items={["migrate", "generate"]}>
            <Tab value="migrate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli migrate
            ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="generate">

        ### Set up Stripe webhooks

        Create a webhook endpoint in your Stripe dashboard pointing to:

        ```
        https://your-domain.com/api/auth/stripe/webhook
        ```
        `/api/auth` is the default path for the auth server.
        
        Make sure to select at least these events:
        - `checkout.session.completed`
        - `customer.subscription.updated`
        - `customer.subscription.deleted`

        Save the webhook signing secret provided by Stripe and add it to your environment variables as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

### Customer Management

You can use this plugin solely for customer management without enabling subscriptions. This is useful if you just want to link Stripe customers to your users.

By default, when a user signs up, a Stripe customer is automatically created if you set `createCustomerOnSignUp: true`. This customer is linked to the user in your database.
You can customize the customer creation process:

```ts title="auth.ts"
stripe({
    // ... other options
    createCustomerOnSignUp: true,
    onCustomerCreate: async ({ customer, stripeCustomer, user }, request) => {
        // Do something with the newly created customer
        console.log(`Customer ${customer.id} created for user ${user.id}`);
    },
    getCustomerCreateParams: async ({ user, session }, request) => {
        // Customize the Stripe customer creation parameters
        return {
            metadata: {
                referralSource: user.metadata?.referralSource
            }
        };
    }
})
```

### Subscription Management

#### Defining Plans

You can define your subscription plans either statically or dynamically:

```ts title="auth.ts"
// Static plans
subscription: {
    enabled: true,
    plans: [
        {
            name: "basic", // the name of the plan, it'll be automatically lower cased when stored in the database
            priceId: "price_1234567890", // the price ID from stripe
            annualDiscountPriceId: "price_1234567890", // (optional) the price ID for annual billing with a discount
            limits: {
                projects: 5,
                storage: 10
            }
        },
        {
            name: "pro",
            priceId: "price_0987654321",
            limits: {
                projects: 20,
                storage: 50
            },
            freeTrial: {
                days: 14,
            }
        }
    ]
}

// Dynamic plans (fetched from database or API)
subscription: {
    enabled: true,
    plans: async () => {
        const plans = await db.query("SELECT * FROM plans");
        return plans.map(plan => ({
            name: plan.name,
            priceId: plan.stripe_price_id,
            limits: JSON.parse(plan.limits)
        }));
    }
}
```

see [plan configuration](#plan-configuration) for more.

#### Creating a Subscription

To create a subscription, use the `subscription.upgrade` method:

<APIMethod
  path="/subscription/upgrade"
  method="POST"
  requireSession
>
```ts
type upgradeSubscription = {
    /**
     * The name of the plan to upgrade to. 
     */
    plan: string = "pro"
    /**
     * Whether to upgrade to an annual plan. 
     */
    annual?: boolean = true
    /**
     * Reference id of the subscription to upgrade. 
     */
    referenceId?: string = "123"
    /**
     * The id of the subscription to upgrade. 
     */
    subscriptionId?: string = "sub_123"
    metadata?: Record<string, any>
    /**
     * Number of seats to upgrade to (if applicable). 
     */
    seats?: number = 1
    /**
     * Callback URL to redirect back after successful subscription. 
     */
    successUrl: string
    /**
     * If set, checkout shows a back button and customers will be directed here if they cancel payment.
     */
    cancelUrl: string 
    /**
     * URL to take customers to when they click on the billing portal’s link to return to your website.
     */
    returnUrl?: string
    /**
     * Disable redirect after successful subscription. 
     */
    disableRedirect: boolean = true
}
```
</APIMethod>

**Simple Example:**

```ts title="client.ts"
await client.subscription.upgrade({
    plan: "pro",
    successUrl: "/dashboard",
    cancelUrl: "/pricing",
    annual: true, // Optional: upgrade to an annual plan
    referenceId: "org_123" // Optional: defaults to the current logged in user ID
    seats: 5 // Optional: for team plans
});
```

This will create a Checkout Session and redirect the user to the Stripe Checkout page.

<Callout type="warn">
If the user already has an active subscription, you *must* provide the `subscriptionId` parameter. Otherwise, the user will be subscribed to (and pay for) both plans.
</Callout>

> **Important:** The `successUrl` parameter will be internally modified to handle race conditions between checkout completion and webhook processing. The plugin creates an intermediate redirect that ensures subscription status is properly updated before redirecting to your success page.

```ts
const { error } = await client.subscription.upgrade({
    plan: "pro",
    successUrl: "/dashboard",
    cancelUrl: "/pricing",
});
if(error) {
    alert(error.message);
}
```

<Callout type="warn">
For each reference ID (user or organization), only one active or trialing subscription is supported at a time. The plugin doesn't currently support multiple concurrent active subscriptions for the same reference ID.
</Callout>

#### Switching Plans

To switch a subscription to a different plan, use the `subscription.upgrade` method:
```ts title="client.ts"
await client.subscription.upgrade({
    plan: "pro",
    successUrl: "/dashboard",
    cancelUrl: "/pricing",
    subscriptionId: "sub_123", // the Stripe subscription ID of the user's current plan
});
```
This ensures that the user only pays for the new plan, and not both.

#### Listing Active Subscriptions

To get the user's active subscriptions:

<APIMethod
  path="/subscription/list"
  method="GET"
  requireSession
  resultVariable="subscriptions"
>
```ts
type listActiveSubscriptions = {
    /**
     * Reference id of the subscription to list. 
     */
    referenceId?: string = '123'
}

// get the active subscription
const activeSubscription = subscriptions.find(
    sub => sub.status === "active" || sub.status === "trialing"
);

// Check subscription limits
const projectLimit = subscriptions?.limits?.projects || 0;
```
</APIMethod>

#### Canceling a Subscription

To cancel a subscription:

<APIMethod
  path="/subscription/cancel"
  method="POST"
  requireSession
>
```ts
type cancelSubscription = {
    /**
     * Reference id of the subscription to cancel. Defaults to the userId.
     */
    referenceId?: string = 'org_123'
    /**
     * The id of the subscription to cancel. 
     */
    subscriptionId?: string = 'sub_123'
    /**
     * URL to take customers to when they click on the billing portal’s link to return to your website.
     */
    returnUrl: string = '/account'
}
```
</APIMethod>

This will redirect the user to the Stripe Billing Portal where they can cancel their subscription.

#### Restoring a Canceled Subscription

If a user changes their mind after canceling a subscription (but before the subscription period ends), you can restore the subscription:


<APIMethod
  path="/subscription/restore"
  method="POST"
  requireSession
>
```ts
type restoreSubscription = {
    /**
     * Reference id of the subscription to restore. Defaults to the userId.
     */
    referenceId?: string = '123'
    /**
     * The id of the subscription to restore. 
     */
    subscriptionId?: string = 'sub_123'
}
```
</APIMethod>


This will reactivate a subscription that was previously set to cancel at the end of the billing period (`cancelAtPeriodEnd: true`). The subscription will continue to renew automatically.

> **Note:** This only works for subscriptions that are still active but marked to cancel at the end of the period. It cannot restore subscriptions that have already ended.

### Reference System

By default, subscriptions are associated with the user ID. However, you can use a custom reference ID to associate subscriptions with other entities, such as organizations:

```ts title="client.ts"
// Create a subscription for an organization
await client.subscription.upgrade({
    plan: "pro",
    referenceId: "org_123456",
    successUrl: "/dashboard",
    cancelUrl: "/pricing",
    seats: 5 // Number of seats for team plans
});

// List subscriptions for an organization
const { data: subscriptions } = await client.subscription.list({
    query: {
        referenceId: "org_123456"
    }
});
```

#### Team Subscriptions with Seats

For team or organization plans, you can specify the number of seats:

```ts
await client.subscription.upgrade({
    plan: "team",
    referenceId: "org_123456",
    seats: 10, // 10 team members
    successUrl: "/org/billing/success",
    cancelUrl: "/org/billing"
});
```

The `seats` parameter is passed to Stripe as the quantity for the subscription item. You can use this value in your application logic to limit the number of members in a team or organization.

To authorize reference IDs, implement the `authorizeReference` function:

```ts title="auth.ts"
subscription: {
    // ... other options
    authorizeReference: async ({ user, session, referenceId, action }) => {
        // Check if the user has permission to manage subscriptions for this reference
        if (action === "upgrade-subscription" || action === "cancel-subscription" || action === "restore-subscription") {
            const org = await db.member.findFirst({
                where: {
                    organizationId: referenceId,
                    userId: user.id
                }   
            });
            return org?.role === "owner"
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Webhook Handling

The plugin automatically handles common webhook events:

- `checkout.session.completed`: Updates subscription status after checkout
- `customer.subscription.updated`: Updates subscription details when changed
- `customer.subscription.deleted`: Marks subscription as canceled

You can also handle custom events:

```ts title="auth.ts"
stripe({
    // ... other options
    onEvent: async (event) => {
        // Handle any Stripe event
        switch (event.type) {
            case "invoice.paid":
                // Handle paid invoice
                break;
            case "payment_intent.succeeded":
                // Handle successful payment
                break;
        }
    }
})
```

### Subscription Lifecycle Hooks

You can hook into various subscription lifecycle events:

```ts title="auth.ts"
subscription: {
    // ... other options
    onSubscriptionComplete: async ({ event, subscription, stripeSubscription, plan }) => {
        // Called when a subscription is successfully created
        await sendWelcomeEmail(subscription.referenceId, plan.name);
    },
    onSubscriptionUpdate: async ({ event, subscription }) => {
        // Called when a subscription is updated
        console.log(`Subscription ${subscription.id} updated`);
    },
    onSubscriptionCancel: async ({ event, subscription, stripeSubscription, cancellationDetails }) => {
        // Called when a subscription is canceled
        await sendCancellationEmail(subscription.referenceId);
    },
    onSubscriptionDeleted: async ({ event, subscription, stripeSubscription }) => {
        // Called when a subscription is deleted
        console.log(`Subscription ${subscription.id} deleted`);
    }
}
```

### Trial Periods

You can configure trial periods for your plans:

```ts title="auth.ts"
{
    name: "pro",
    priceId: "price_0987654321",
    freeTrial: {
        days: 14,
        onTrialStart: async (subscription) => {
            // Called when a trial starts
            await sendTrialStartEmail(subscription.referenceId);
        },
        onTrialEnd: async ({ subscription, user }, request) => {
            // Called when a trial ends
            await sendTrialEndEmail(user.email);
        },
        onTrialExpired: async (subscription) => {
            // Called when a trial expires without conversion
            await sendTrialExpiredEmail(subscription.referenceId);
        }
    }
}
```

## Schema

The Stripe plugin adds the following tables to your database:


### User

Table Name: `user`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    { 
      name: "stripeCustomerId", 
      type: "string", 
      description: "The Stripe customer ID",
      isOptional: true
    },
  ]}
/>

### Subscription

Table Name: `subscription`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
    { 
      name: "id", 
      type: "string", 
      description: "Unique identifier for each subscription",
      isPrimaryKey: true
    },
    { 
      name: "plan", 
      type: "string", 
      description: "The name of the subscription plan" 
    },
    { 
      name: "referenceId", 
      type: "string", 
      description: "The ID this subscription is associated with (user ID by default)",
      isUnique: true
    },
    { 
      name: "stripeCustomerId", 
      type: "string", 
      description: "The Stripe customer ID",
      isOptional: true
    },
    { 
      name: "stripeSubscriptionId", 
      type: "string", 
      description: "The Stripe subscription ID",
      isOptional: true
    },
    { 
      name: "status", 
      type: "string", 
      description: "The status of the subscription (active, canceled, etc.)",
      defaultValue: "incomplete"
    },
    { 
      name: "periodStart", 
      type: "Date", 
      description: "Start date of the current billing period",
      isOptional: true
    },
    { 
      name: "periodEnd", 
      type: "Date", 
      description: "End date of the current billing period",
      isOptional: true
    },
    { 
      name: "cancelAtPeriodEnd", 
      type: "boolean", 
      description: "Whether the subscription will be canceled at the end of the period",
      defaultValue: false,
      isOptional: true
    },
    { 
      name: "seats", 
      type: "number", 
      description: "Number of seats for team plans",
      isOptional: true
    },
    { 
      name: "trialStart", 
      type: "Date", 
      description: "Start date of the trial period",
      isOptional: true
    },
    { 
      name: "trialEnd", 
      type: "Date", 
      description: "End date of the trial period",
      isOptional: true
    }
  ]}
/>

### Customizing the Schema

To change the schema table names or fields, you can pass a `schema` option to the Stripe plugin:

```ts title="auth.ts"
stripe({
    // ... other options
    schema: {
        subscription: {
            modelName: "stripeSubscriptions", // map the subscription table to stripeSubscriptions
            fields: {
                plan: "planName" // map the plan field to planName
            }
        }
    }
})
```

## Advanced Usage

### Using with Organizations

The Stripe plugin works well with the organization plugin. You can associate subscriptions with organizations instead of individual users:

```ts title="client.ts"
// Get the active organization
const { data: activeOrg } = client.useActiveOrganization();

// Create a subscription for the organization
await client.subscription.upgrade({
    plan: "team",
    referenceId: activeOrg.id,
    seats: 10,
    annual: true, // upgrade to an annual plan (optional)
    successUrl: "/org/billing/success",
    cancelUrl: "/org/billing"
});
```

Make sure to implement the `authorizeReference` function to verify that the user has permission to manage subscriptions for the organization:

```ts title="auth.ts"
authorizeReference: async ({ user, referenceId, action }) => {
    const member = await db.members.findFirst({
        where: {
            userId: user.id,
            organizationId: referenceId
        }
    });
    
    return member?.role === "owner" || member?.role === "admin";
}
```

### Custom Checkout Session Parameters

You can customize the Stripe Checkout session with additional parameters:

```ts title="auth.ts"
getCheckoutSessionParams: async ({ user, session, plan, subscription }, request) => {
    return {
        params: {
            allow_promotion_codes: true,
            tax_id_collection: {
                enabled: true
            },
            billing_address_collection: "required",
            custom_text: {
                submit: {
                    message: "We'll start your subscription right away"
                }
            },
            metadata: {
                planType: "business",
                referralCode: user.metadata?.referralCode
            }
        },
        options: {
            idempotencyKey: `sub_${user.id}_${plan.name}_${Date.now()}`
        }
    };
}
```

### Tax Collection

To collect tax IDs from the customer, set `tax_id_collection` to true:

```ts title="auth.ts"
subscription: {
    // ... other options
    getCheckoutSessionParams: async ({ user, session, plan, subscription }, request) => {
        return {
            params: {
                tax_id_collection: {
                    enabled: true
                }
            }
        };
    }
}
```

### Automatic Tax Calculation

To enable automatic tax calculation using the customer’s location, set `automatic_tax` to true. Enabling this parameter causes Checkout to collect any billing address information necessary for tax calculation. You need to have tax registration setup and configured in the Stripe dashboard first for this to work.

```ts title="auth.ts"
subscription: {
    // ... other options
    getCheckoutSessionParams: async ({ user, session, plan, subscription }, request) => {
        return {
            params: {
                automatic_tax: {
                    enabled: true
                }
            }
        };
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Issues

If webhooks aren't being processed correctly:

1. Check that your webhook URL is correctly configured in the Stripe dashboard
2. Verify that the webhook signing secret is correct
3. Ensure you've selected all the necessary events in the Stripe dashboard
4. Check your server logs for any errors during webhook processing

### Subscription Status Issues

If subscription statuses aren't updating correctly:

1. Make sure the webhook events are being received and processed
2. Check that the `stripeCustomerId` and `stripeSubscriptionId` fields are correctly populated
3. Verify that the reference IDs match between your application and Stripe

### Testing Webhooks Locally

For local development, you can use the Stripe CLI to forward webhooks to your local environment:

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/auth/stripe/webhook
```

This will provide you with a webhook signing secret that you can use in your local environment.

## Installation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Add Plugin to the server

        ```ts title="auth.ts" 
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
        import { username } from "better-auth/plugins"

        export const auth = betterAuth({
            plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
                username() // [!code highlight]
            ] // [!code highlight]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Migrate the database

        Run the migration or generate the schema to add the necessary fields and tables to the database.

        <Tabs items={["migrate", "generate"]}>
            <Tab value="migrate">
            ```bash
            npx @better-auth/cli migrate
            ```
            </Tab>

            ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
        See the [Schema](#schema) section to add the fields manually.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Add the client plugin
        
        ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
        import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
        import { usernameClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
        
        export const authClient = createAuthClient({
            plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
                usernameClient() // [!code highlight]
            ] // [!code highlight]
        })
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

### Sign up

To sign up a user with username, you can use the existing `signUp.email` function provided by the client. The `signUp` function should take a new `username` property in the object.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const data = await authClient.signUp.email({
    email: "email@domain.com",
    name: "Test User",
    password: "password1234",
    username: "test"
})
```

### Sign in

To sign in a user with username, you can use the `signIn.username` function provided by the client. The `signIn` function takes an object with the following properties:

- `username`: The username of the user.
- `password`: The password of the user.

```ts title="auth-client.ts" 
const data = await authClient.signIn.username({
    username: "test",
    password: "password1234",
})
```

### Update username

To update the username of a user, you can use the `updateUser` function provided by the client.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const data = await authClient.updateUser({
    username: "new-username"
})
```

### Check if username is available

To check if a username is available, you can use the `isUsernameAvailable` function provided by the client.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const response = await authClient.isUsernameAvailable({
    username: "new-username"
});

if(response.data?.available) {
    console.log("Username is available");
} else {
    console.log("Username is not available");
}
```


## Schema

The plugin requires 2 fields to be added to the user table:

<DatabaseTable
    fields={[
        { 
            name: "username", 
            type: "string", 
            description: "The username of the user",
            isUnique: true
        },
        { 
            name: "displayUsername", 
            type: "string", 
            description: "Non normalized username of the user",
            isUnique: true
        },
    ]}
/>

## Options

**Min Username Length**

The minimum length of the username. Default is `3`.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { username } from "better-auth/plugins"

const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        username({
            minUsernameLength: 5
        })
    ]
})
```

**Max Username Length**

The maximum length of the username. Default is `30`.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { username } from "better-auth/plugins"

const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        username({
            maxUsernameLength: 100
        })
    ]
})
```

**Username Validator**

A function that validates the username. The function should return false if the username is invalid. By default, the username should only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, and dots.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { username } from "better-auth/plugins"

const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        username({
            usernameValidator: (username) => {
                if (username === "admin") {
                    return false
                }
                return true
            }
        })
    ]
})
```

### Username Normalization

A function that normalizes the username, or `false` if you want to disable normalization.

By default, usernames are case-insensitive, so "TestUser" and "testuser", for example, are considered the same username. The `username` field will contain the normalized (lower case) username, while `displayUsername` will contain the original `username`.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { username } from "better-auth/plugins"

const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        username({
            usernameNormalization: (username) => {
                return username.toLowerCase()
                    .replaceAll("0", "o")
                    .replaceAll("3", "e")
                    .replaceAll("4", "a");
            }
        })
    ]
})
```

title: FAQ
description: Frequently asked questions about Better Auth.
---

This page contains frequently asked questions, common issues, and other helpful information about Better Auth.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Auth client not working">
  When encountering `createAuthClient` related errors, make sure to have the correct import path as it varies based on environment.

If you're using the auth client on react front-end, you'll need to import it from `/react`:

```ts title="component.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/react";
```

Where as if you're using the auth client in Next.js middleware, server-actions, server-components or anything server-related, you'll likely need to import it from `/client`:

```ts title="server.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="getSession not working">
If you try to call `authClient.getSession` on a server environment (e.g, a Next.js server component), it doesn't work since it can't access the cookies. You can use the `auth.api.getSession` instead and pass the request headers to it. 

```tsx title="server.tsx"
import { auth } from "./auth";
import { headers } from "next/headers";

const session = await auth.api.getSession({
    headers: await headers()
})
```

if you need to use the auth client on the server for different purposes, you still can pass the request headers to it:

```tsx title="server.tsx"
import { authClient } from "./auth-client";
import { headers } from "next/headers";

const session = await authClient.getSession({
    fetchOptions:{
      headers: await headers()
    }
})
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Adding custom fields to the users table">

Better Auth provides a type-safe way to extend the user and session schemas, take a look at our docs on <Link href="/docs/concepts/database#extending-core-schema">extending core schema</Link>.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Difference between getSession and useSession">
Both `useSession` and `getSession` instances are used fundamentally different based on the situation.

`useSession` is a hook, meaning it can trigger re-renders whenever session data changes.

If you have UI you need to change based on user or session data, you can use this hook.

<Callout type="warn">
  For performance reasons, do not use this hook on your `layout.tsx` file. We
  recommend using RSC and use your server auth instance to get the session data
  via `auth.api.getSession`.
</Callout>

`getSession` returns a promise containing data and error.

For all other situations where you shouldn't use `useSession`, is when you should be using `getSession`.

<Callout type="info">
   `getSession` is available on both server and client auth instances.
   Not just the latter.
</Callout>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Common TypeScript Errors">
If you're facing typescript errors, make sure your tsconfig has `strict` set to `true`:
```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
  }
}
```

if you can't set strict to true, you can enable strictNullChecks:
```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strictNullChecks": true,
  }
}
```

You can learn more in our <Link href="/docs/concepts/typescript#typescript-config">TypeScript docs</Link>.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I remove `name`, `image`, or `email` fields from the user table?">
At this time, you can't remove the `name`, `image`, or `email` fields from the user table.

We do plan to have more customizability in the future in this regard, but for now, you can't remove these fields.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

title: Options
description: Better Auth configuration options reference.
---

List of all the available options for configuring Better Auth. See [Better Auth Options](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/blob/main/packages/better-auth/src/types/options.ts#L13).

## `appName`

The name of the application.

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
export const auth = betterAuth({
	appName: "My App",
})
```

## `baseURL`

Base URL for Better Auth. This is typically the root URL where your application server is hosted. Note: If you include a path in the baseURL, it will take precedence over the default path.

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
export const auth = betterAuth({
	baseURL: "https://example.com",
})
```

If not explicitly set, the system will check for the environment variable `process.env.BETTER_AUTH_URL`

## `basePath`

Base path for Better Auth. This is typically the path where the Better Auth routes are mounted. It will be overridden if there is a path component within `baseURL`.

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
export const auth = betterAuth({
	basePath: "/api/auth",
})
```

Default: `/api/auth`

## `trustedOrigins`

List of trusted origins.

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
export const auth = betterAuth({
	trustedOrigins: ["http://localhost:3000", "https://example.com"],
})
```

## `secret`

The secret used for encryption, signing, and hashing.

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
export const auth = betterAuth({
	secret: "your-secret-key",
})
```

By default, Better Auth will look for the following environment variables:
- `process.env.BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
- `process.env.AUTH_SECRET`

If none of these environment variables are set, it will default to `"better-auth-secret-123456789"`. In production, if it's not set, it will throw an error.

You can generate a good secret using the following command:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

## `database`

Database configuration for Better Auth.

```ts
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
export const auth = betterAuth({
	database: {
		dialect: "postgres",
		type: "postgres",
		casing: "camel"
	},
})
```

Better Auth supports various database configurations including [PostgreSQL](/docs/adapters/postgresql), [MySQL](/docs/adapters/mysql), and [SQLite](/docs/adapters/sqlite).

Read more about databases [here](/docs/concepts/database).

				}
			},
			update: {
				before: async (userData) => {
					// Modify user data before update
					return { data: { ...userData, updatedAt: new Date() } };
				},
				after: async (user) => {
					// Perform actions after user update
				}
			}
		},
		session: {
			// Session hooks
		},
		account: {
			// Account hooks
		},
		verification: {
			// Verification hooks
		}
	},
})
```

## `onAPIError`

title: Security
description: Better Auth security features.
---

This page contains information about security features of Better Auth.


## Password Hashing

Better Auth uses the `scrypt` algorithm to hash passwords by default. This algorithm is designed to be memory-hard and CPU-intensive, making it resistant to brute-force attacks. You can customize the password hashing function by setting the `password` option in the configuration. This option should include a `hash` function to hash passwords and a `verify` function to verify them.

## Session Management

### Session Expiration

Better Auth uses secure session management to protect user data. Sessions are stored in the database or a secondary storage, if configured, to prevent unauthorized access. By default, sessions expire after 7 days, but you can customize this value in the configuration. Additionally, each time a session is used, if it reaches the `updateAge` threshold, the expiration date is extended, which by default is set to 1 day.

### Session Revocation

Better Auth allows you to revoke sessions to enhance security. When a session is revoked, the user is logged out and can no longer access the application. A logged in user can also revoke their own sessions to log out from different devices or browsers.

See the [session management](/docs/concepts/session-management) for more details.

## CSRF Protection

Better Auth ensures CSRF protection by validating the Origin header in requests. This check confirms that requests originate from the application or a trusted source. If a request comes from an untrusted origin, it is blocked to prevent potential CSRF attacks. By default, the origin matching the base URL is trusted, but you can set a list of trusted origins in the trustedOrigins configuration option.

## OAuth State and PKCE

To secure OAuth flows, Better Auth stores the OAuth state and PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) in the database. The state helps prevent CSRF attacks, while PKCE protects against code injection threats. Once the OAuth process completes, these values are removed from the database.

## Cookies

Better Auth assigns secure cookies by default when the base URL uses `https`. These secure cookies are encrypted and only sent over secure connections, adding an extra layer of protection. They are also set with the `sameSite` attribute to `lax` by default to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. And the `httpOnly` attribute is enabled to prevent client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie. 

For Cross-Subdomain Cookies, you can set the `crossSubDomainCookies` option in the configuration. This option allows cookies to be shared across subdomains, enabling seamless authentication across multiple subdomains.

### Customizing Cookies

You can customize cookie names to minimize the risk of fingerprinting attacks and set specific cookie options as needed for additional control. For more information, refer to the [cookie options](/docs/concepts/cookies).

Plugins can also set custom cookie options to align with specific security needs. If you're using Better Auth in non-browser environments, plugins offer ways to manage cookies securely in those contexts as well.

## Rate Limiting

Better Auth includes built-in rate limiting to safeguard against brute-force attacks. Rate limits are applied across all routes by default, with specific routes subject to stricter limits based on potential risk.

## IP Address Headers

Better Auth uses client IP addresses for rate limiting and security monitoring. By default, it reads the IP address from the standard `X-Forwarded-For` header. However, you can configure a specific trusted header to ensure accurate IP address detection and prevent IP spoofing attacks.

You can configure the IP address header in your Better Auth configuration:

```typescript
{
  advanced: {
    ipAddress: {
      ipAddressHeaders: ['cf-connecting-ip'] // or any other custom header
    }
  }
}
```

This ensures that Better Auth only accepts IP addresses from your trusted proxy's header, making it more difficult for attackers to bypass rate limiting or other IP-based security measures by spoofing headers.

> **Important**: When setting a custom IP address header, ensure that your proxy or load balancer is properly configured to set this header, and that it cannot be set by end users directly.

## Trusted Origins

Trusted origins prevent CSRF attacks and block open redirects. You can set a list of trusted origins in the `trustedOrigins` configuration option. Requests from origins not on this list are automatically blocked.

### Basic Usage

The most basic usage is to specify exact origins:

```typescript
{
  trustedOrigins: [
    "https://example.com",
    "https://app.example.com",
    "http://localhost:3000"
  ]
}
```

### Wildcard Domains

Better Auth supports wildcard patterns in trusted origins, which allows you to trust multiple subdomains with a single entry:

```typescript
{
  trustedOrigins: [
    "*.example.com",             // Trust all subdomains of example.com (any protocol)
    "https://*.example.com",     // Trust only HTTPS subdomains of example.com
    "http://*.dev.example.com"   // Trust all HTTP subdomains of dev.example.com
  ]
}
```

#### Protocol-specific wildcards

When using a wildcard pattern with a protocol prefix (like `https://`):
- The protocol must match exactly
- The domain can have any subdomain in place of the `*`
- Requests using a different protocol will be rejected, even if the domain matches

#### Protocol-agnostic wildcards

When using a wildcard pattern without a protocol prefix (like `*.example.com`):
- Any protocol (http, https, etc.) will be accepted
- The domain must match the wildcard pattern

### Custom Schemes

Trusted origins also support custom schemes for mobile apps and browser extensions:

```typescript
{
  trustedOrigins: [
    "myapp://",                               // Mobile app scheme
    "chrome-extension://YOUR_EXTENSION_ID"    // Browser extension
  ]
}
```

title: Basic Usage
description: Getting started with Better Auth
---

Better Auth provides built-in authentication support for:

- **Email and password**
- **Social provider (Google, GitHub, Apple, and more)**

But also can easily be extended using plugins, such as: [username](/docs/plugins/username), [magic link](/docs/plugins/magic-link), [passkey](/docs/plugins/passkey), [email-otp](/docs/plugins/email-otp), and more.

## Email & Password

To enable email and password authentication:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    emailAndPassword: {    // [!code highlight]
        enabled: true // [!code highlight]
    } // [!code highlight]
})
```

### Sign Up

To sign up a user you need to call the client method `signUp.email` with the user's information.

```ts title="sign-up.ts"
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client"; //import the auth client // [!code highlight]

const { data, error } = await authClient.signUp.email({
        email, // user email address
        password, // user password -> min 8 characters by default
        name, // user display name
        image, // User image URL (optional)
        callbackURL: "/dashboard" // A URL to redirect to after the user verifies their email (optional)
    }, {
        onRequest: (ctx) => {
            //show loading
        },
        onSuccess: (ctx) => {
            //redirect to the dashboard or sign in page
        },
        onError: (ctx) => {
            // display the error message
            alert(ctx.error.message);
        },
});
```

By default, the users are automatically signed in after they successfully sign up. To disable this behavior you can set `autoSignIn` to `false`.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"

export const auth = betterAuth({
    emailAndPassword: {
    	enabled: true,
    	autoSignIn: false //defaults to true // [!code highlight]
  },
})
```


### Sign In

To sign a user in, you can use the `signIn.email` function provided by the client.

```ts title="sign-in"
const { data, error } = await authClient.signIn.email({
        /**
         * The user email
         */
        email,
        /**
         * The user password
         */
        password,
        /**
         * A URL to redirect to after the user verifies their email (optional)
         */
        callbackURL: "/dashboard",
        /**
         * remember the user session after the browser is closed. 
         * @default true
         */
        rememberMe: false
}, {
    //callbacks
})
```

<Callout type="warn">
Always invoke client methods from the client side. Don't call them from the server.
</Callout>

### Server-Side Authentication

To authenticate a user on the server, you can use the `auth.api` methods.

```ts title="server.ts"
import { auth } from "./auth"; // path to your Better Auth server instance

const response = await auth.api.signInEmail({
    body: {
        email,
        password
    },
    asResponse: true // returns a response object instead of data
});
```

<Callout>
If the server cannot return a response object, you'll need to manually parse and set cookies. But for frameworks like Next.js we provide [a plugin](/docs/integrations/next#server-action-cookies) to handle this automatically
</Callout>

## Social Sign-On

Better Auth supports multiple social providers, including Google, GitHub, Apple, Discord, and more. To use a social provider, you need to configure the ones you need in the `socialProviders` option on your `auth` object.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    socialProviders: { // [!code highlight]
        github: { // [!code highlight]
            clientId: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID!, // [!code highlight]
            clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET!, // [!code highlight]
        } // [!code highlight]
    }, // [!code highlight]
})
```

### Sign in with social providers

To sign in using a social provider you need to call `signIn.social`. It takes an object with the following properties:

```ts title="sign-in.ts"
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client"; //import the auth client // [!code highlight]

await authClient.signIn.social({
    /**
     * The social provider ID
     * @example "github", "google", "apple"
     */
    provider: "github",
    /**
     * A URL to redirect after the user authenticates with the provider
     * @default "/"
     */
    callbackURL: "/dashboard", 
    /**
     * A URL to redirect if an error occurs during the sign in process
     */
    errorCallbackURL: "/error",
    /**
     * A URL to redirect if the user is newly registered
     */
    newUserCallbackURL: "/welcome",
    /**
     * disable the automatic redirect to the provider. 
     * @default false
     */
    disableRedirect: true,
});
```

You can also authenticate using `idToken` or `accessToken` from the social provider instead of redirecting the user to the provider's site. See social providers documentation for more details. 

## Signout

To signout a user, you can use the `signOut` function provided by the client.

```ts title="user-card.tsx"
await authClient.signOut();
```

you can pass `fetchOptions` to redirect onSuccess
  
```ts title="user-card.tsx" 
await authClient.signOut({
  fetchOptions: {
    onSuccess: () => {
      router.push("/login"); // redirect to login page
    },
  },
});
```

## Session

Once a user is signed in, you'll want to access the user session. Better Auth allows you easily to access the session data from the server and client side.

### Client Side

#### Use Session

Better Auth provides a `useSession` hook to easily access session data on the client side. This hook is implemented using nanostore and has support for each supported framework and vanilla client, ensuring that any changes to the session (such as signing out) are immediately reflected in your UI.

<Tabs items={["React", "Vue","Svelte", "Solid", "Vanilla"]} defaultValue="React">
    <Tab value="React">
        ```tsx title="user.tsx"
        import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client" // import the auth client // [!code highlight] 

        export function User(){

            const { // [!code highlight]
                data: session, // [!code highlight]
                isPending, //loading state // [!code highlight]
                error, //error object // [!code highlight]
                refetch //refetch the session
            } = authClient.useSession() // [!code highlight]

            return (
                //...
            )
        }

                    <pre>{JSON.stringify(session(), null, 2)}</pre>
                );
            }
            ```
        </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Get Session

If you prefer not to use the hook, you can use the `getSession` method provided by the client.

```ts title="user.tsx"
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client" // import the auth client // [!code highlight]

const { data: session, error } = await authClient.getSession()
```

You can also use it with client-side data-fetching libraries like [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest).

### Server Side

The server provides a `session` object that you can use to access the session data. It requires request headers object to be passed to the `getSession` method.

## Using Plugins

One of the unique features of Better Auth is a plugins ecosystem. It allows you to add complex auth related functionality with small lines of code.

Below is an example of how to add two factor authentication using two factor plugin.

<Steps>

<Step>
### Server Configuration

To add a plugin, you need to import the plugin and pass it to the `plugins` option of the auth instance. For example, to add two factor authentication, you can use the following code:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { twoFactor } from "better-auth/plugins" // [!code highlight]

export const auth = betterAuth({
    //...rest of the options
    plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
        twoFactor() // [!code highlight]
    ] // [!code highlight]
})
```
now two factor related routes and method will be available on the server.

</Step>
<Step>
### Migrate Database

After adding the plugin, you'll need to add the required tables to your database. You can do this by running the `migrate` command, or by using the `generate` command to create the schema and handle the migration manually.

generating the schema:

```bash title="terminal"
npx @better-auth/cli generate
```

using the `migrate` command:

```bash title="terminal"
npx @better-auth/cli migrate
```

<Callout>
If you prefer adding the schema manually, you can check the schema required on the [two factor plugin](/docs/plugins/2fa#schema) documentation.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>
### Client Configuration

Once we're done with the server, we need to add the plugin to the client. To do this, you need to import the plugin and pass it to the `plugins` option of the auth client. For example, to add two factor authentication, you can use the following code:

```ts title="auth-client.ts"  
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import { twoFactorClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"; // [!code highlight]

const authClient = createAuthClient({
    plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
        twoFactorClient({ // [!code highlight]
            twoFactorPage: "/two-factor" // the page to redirect if a user need to verify 2nd factor // [!code highlight]
        }) // [!code highlight]
    ] // [!code highlight]
})
```

now two factor related methods will be available on the client.

```ts title="profile.ts"
import { authClient } from "./auth-client"

const enableTwoFactor = async() => {
    const data = await authClient.twoFactor.enable({
        password // the user password is required
    }) // this will enable two factor
}

const disableTwoFactor = async() => {
    const data = await authClient.twoFactor.disable({
        password // the user password is required
    }) // this will disable two factor
}

const signInWith2Factor = async() => {
    const data = await authClient.signIn.email({
        //...
    })
    //if the user has two factor enabled, it will redirect to the two factor page
}

const verifyTOTP = async() => {
    const data = await authClient.twoFactor.verifyTOTP({
        code: "123456", // the code entered by the user 
        /**
         * If the device is trusted, the user won't
         * need to pass 2FA again on the same device
         */
        trustDevice: true
    })
}

title: Comparison
description: Comparison of Better Auth versus over other auth libraries and services.
---

> <p className="text-orange-200">Comparison is the thief of joy.</p>

Here are non detailed reasons why you may want to use Better Auth over other auth libraries and services.

### vs Other Auth Libraries

- **Framework agnostic** - Works with any framework, not just specific ones
- **Advanced features built-in** - 2FA, multi-tenancy, multi-session, rate limiting, and many more
- **Plugin system** - Extend functionality without forking or complex workarounds
- **Full control** - Customize auth flows exactly how you want

### vs Self-Hosted Auth Servers

- **No separate infrastructure** - Runs in your app, users stay in your database
- **Zero server maintenance** - No auth servers to deploy, monitor, or update
- **Complete feature set** - Everything you need without the operational overhead

### vs Managed Auth Services

- **Keep your data** - Users stay in your database, not a third-party service
- **No per-user costs** - Scale without worrying about auth billing
- **Single source of truth** - All user data in one place

### vs Rolling Your Own

- **Security handled** - Battle-tested auth flows and security practices
- **Focus on your product** - Spend time on features that matter to your business
- **Plugin extensibility** - Add custom features without starting from scratch

title: Installation
description: Learn how to configure Better Auth in your project.
---

<Steps>

<Step>
### Install the Package

Let's start by adding Better Auth to your project:

```package-install
better-auth
```

<Callout type="info">
If you're using a separate client and server setup, make sure to install Better Auth in both parts of your project.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

1. **Secret Key**

Random value used by the library for encryption and generating hashes. **You can generate one using the button below** or you can use something like openssl.

```txt title=".env"
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=
```

<GenerateSecret />

2. **Set Base URL**

```txt title=".env"
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 #Base URL of your app
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Create A Better Auth Instance

Create a file named `auth.ts` in one of these locations:

- Project root
- `lib/` folder
- `utils/` folder

You can also nest any of these folders under `src/`, `app/` or `server/` folder. (e.g. `src/lib/auth.ts`, `app/lib/auth.ts`).

And in this file, import Better Auth and create your auth instance. Make sure to export the auth instance with the variable name `auth` or as a `default` export.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  //...
});
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Database

Better Auth requires a database to store user data.
You can easily configure Better Auth to use SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL, and more!

<Tabs items={["sqlite", "postgres", "mysql"]}>
    <Tab value="sqlite">
    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
    import Database from "better-sqlite3";

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        database: new Database("./sqlite.db"),
    })
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="postgres">
    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
    import { Pool } from "pg";

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        database: new Pool({
            // connection options
        }),
    })
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="mysql">
    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
    import { createPool } from "mysql2/promise";

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        database: createPool({
            // connection options
        }),
    })
    ```
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

Alternatively, if you prefer to use an ORM, you can use one of the built-in adapters.

<Tabs items={["drizzle", "prisma", "mongodb"]}>

    <Tab value="drizzle">
    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
    import { drizzleAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/drizzle";
    import { db } from "@/db"; // your drizzle instance

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        database: drizzleAdapter(db, {
            provider: "pg", // or "mysql", "sqlite"
        }),
    });
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="prisma">
        ```ts title="auth.ts"
        import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
        import { prismaAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/prisma";
        // If your Prisma file is located elsewhere, you can change the path
        import { PrismaClient } from "@/generated/prisma";

        const prisma = new PrismaClient();
        export const auth = betterAuth({
            database: prismaAdapter(prisma, {
                provider: "sqlite", // or "mysql", "postgresql", ...etc
            }),
        });
    ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab value="mongodb">
    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
    import { mongodbAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/mongodb";
    import { client } from "@/db"; // your mongodb client

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        database: mongodbAdapter(client),
    });
    ```
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

<Callout>
  If your database is not listed above, check out our other supported
  [databases](/docs/adapters/other-relational-databases) for more information,
  or use one of the supported ORMs.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
    ### Create Database Tables
    Better Auth includes a CLI tool to help manage the schema required by the library.

    - **Generate**: This command generates an ORM schema or SQL migration file.

    <Callout>
    If you're using Kysely, you can apply the migration directly with `migrate` command below. Use `generate` only if you plan to apply the migration manually.
    </Callout>

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    npx @better-auth/cli generate
    ```

    - **Migrate**: This command creates the required tables directly in the database. (Available only for the built-in Kysely adapter)

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    npx @better-auth/cli migrate
    ```

    see the [CLI documentation](/docs/concepts/cli) for more information.

    <Callout>
     If you instead want to create the schema manually, you can find the core schema required in the [database section](/docs/concepts/database#core-schema).
    </Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

### Authentication Methods

Configure the authentication methods you want to use. Better Auth comes with built-in support for email/password, and social sign-on providers.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  //...other options
  emailAndPassword: {
    // [!code highlight]
    enabled: true, // [!code highlight]
  }, // [!code highlight]
  socialProviders: {
    // [!code highlight]
    github: {
      // [!code highlight]
      clientId: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID as string, // [!code highlight]
      clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET as string, // [!code highlight]
    }, // [!code highlight]
  }, // [!code highlight]
});
```

<Callout type="info">
You can use even more authentication methods like [passkey](/docs/plugins/passkey), [username](/docs/plugins/username), [magic link](/docs/plugins/magic-link) and more through plugins.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Mount Handler
To handle API requests, you need to set up a route handler on your server.

Create a new file or route in your framework's designated catch-all route handler. This route should handle requests for the path `/api/auth/*` (unless you've configured a different base path).

<Callout>
  Better Auth supports any backend framework with standard Request and Response
  objects and offers helper functions for popular frameworks.
</Callout>

    <Tab value="express">
    <Callout type="warn">
        ExpressJS v5 introduced breaking changes to route path matching by switching to `path-to-regexp@6`. Wildcard routes like `*` should now be written using the new named syntax, e.g. `/{*any}`, to properly capture catch-all patterns. This ensures compatibility and predictable behavior across routing scenarios.
        See the [Express v5 migration guide](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html) for details.

        As a result, the implementation in ExpressJS v5 should look like this:

        ```ts
        app.all('/api/auth/{*any}', toNodeHandler(auth));
        ```
        *The name any is arbitrary and can be replaced with any identifier you prefer.*

    const port = 8000;

    app.all("/api/auth/*", toNodeHandler(auth));

    // Mount express json middleware after Better Auth handler
    // or only apply it to routes that don't interact with Better Auth
    app.use(express.json());

    app.listen(port, () => {
        console.log(`Better Auth app listening on port ${port}`);
    });
    ```

### Create Client Instance

The client-side library helps you interact with the auth server. Better Auth comes with a client for all the popular web frameworks, including vanilla JavaScript.

1. Import `createAuthClient` from the package for your framework (e.g., "better-auth/react" for React).
2. Call the function to create your client.
3. Pass the base URL of your auth server. (If the auth server is running on the same domain as your client, you can skip this step.)

<Callout type="info">
  If you're using a different base path other than `/api/auth` make sure to pass
  the whole URL including the path. (e.g.
  `http://localhost:3000/custom-path/auth`)

title: Introduction
description: Introduction to Better Auth.

Better Auth is a framework-agnostic authentication and authorization framework for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities. Whether you need 2FA, multi-tenancy, multi-session support, or even enterprise features like SSO, it lets you focus on building your application instead of reinventing the wheel.

## Why Better Auth?

*Authentication in the TypeScript ecosystem has long been a half-solved problem. Other open-source libraries often require a lot of additional code for anything beyond basic authentication features. Rather than just pushing third-party services as the solution, I believe we can do better as a community—hence, Better Auth.*

## Features

Better Auth aims to be the most comprehensive auth library. It provides a wide range of features out of the box and allows you to extend it with plugins. Here are some of the features:

The `ActiveLinkOptions` type extends the [`LinkOptions`](../LinkOptionsType.md) type and contains additional options that can be used to describe how a link should be styled when it is active.

```tsx
type ActiveLinkOptions = LinkOptions & {
  activeProps?:
    | React.AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>
    | (() => React.AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>);
  inactiveProps?:
    | React.AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>
    | (() => React.AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>);
};
```

## ActiveLinkOptions properties

The `ActiveLinkOptions` object accepts/contains the following properties:

### `activeProps`

- `React.AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>`
- Optional

A component version of the `useMatchRoute` hook. It accepts the same options as the `useMatchRoute` with additional props to aid in conditional rendering.

## MatchRoute props

The `MatchRoute` component accepts the same options as the `useMatchRoute` hook with additional props to aid in conditional rendering.

### `...props` prop

- Type: [`UseMatchRouteOptions`](../UseMatchRouteOptionsType.md)

### `children` prop

- Optional

  resetScroll?: boolean;
  hashScrollIntoView?: boolean | ScrollIntoViewOptions;
  viewTransition?: boolean | ViewTransitionOptions;
  ignoreBlocker?: boolean;
  reloadDocument?: boolean;
  href?: string;
};
```

## NavigateOptions properties

The `NavigateOptions` object accepts the following properties:

### `replace`

- Type: `boolean`
- Optional
- Defaults to `false`.
- If `true`, the location will be committed to the browser history using `history.replace` instead of `history.push`.

### `resetScroll`

- Type: `boolean`
- Optional
- Defaults to `true` so that the scroll position will be reset to 0,0 after the location is committed to the browser history.
- If `false`, the scroll position will not be reset to 0,0 after the location is committed to history.

### `hashScrollIntoView`

- Type: `boolean | ScrollIntoViewOptions`
- Optional
- Defaults to `true` so the element with an id matching the hash will be scrolled into view after the location is committed to history.
- If `false`, the element with an id matching the hash will not be scrolled into view after the location is committed to history.
- If an object is provided, it will be passed to the `scrollIntoView` method as options.
- See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView) for more information on `ScrollIntoViewOptions`.

### `viewTransition`

- Type: `boolean | ViewTransitionOptions`
- Optional
- Defaults to `false`.
- If `true`, navigation will be called using `document.startViewTransition()`.
- If [`ViewTransitionOptions`](../ViewTransitionOptionsType.md), route navigations will be called using `document.startViewTransition({update, types})` where `types` will be the strings array passed with `ViewTransitionOptions["types"]`. If the browser does not support viewTransition types, the navigation will fall back to normal `document.startTransition()`, same as if `true` was passed.
- If the browser does not support this api, this option will be ignored.
- See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/startViewTransition) for more information on how this function works.
- See [Google](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/same-document#view-transition-types) for more information on viewTransition types

### `ignoreBlocker`

- Type: `boolean`
- Optional
- Defaults to `false`.
- If `true`, navigation will ignore any blockers that might prevent it.

### `reloadDocument`

- Type: `boolean`
- Optional
- Defaults to `false`.
- If `true`, navigation to a route inside of router will trigger a full page load instead of the traditional SPA navigation.

### `href`

- Type: `string`
- Optional
- This can be used instead of `to` to navigate to a fully built href, e.g. pointing to an external target.

<file path="docs/react/api/router/NotFoundErrorType.md">
---
id: NotFoundErrorType
title: NotFoundError
---

The `NotFoundError` type is used to represent a not-found error in TanStack Router.

```tsx
export type NotFoundError = {
  global?: boolean;
  data?: any;
  throw?: boolean;
  routeId?: string;
};
```

## NotFoundError properties

The `NotFoundError` object accepts/contains the following properties:

### `data` property

- Type: `any`
- Optional
- Custom data that is passed into to `notFoundComponent` when the not-found error is handled

### `global` property

- Type: `boolean`
- Optional - `default: false`
- If true, the not-found error will be handled by the `notFoundComponent` of the root route instead of bubbling up from the route that threw it. This has the same behavior as importing the root route and calling `RootRoute.notFound()`.

### `route` property

- Type: `string`
- Optional
- The ID of the route that will attempt to handle the not-found error. If the route does not have a `notFoundComponent`, the error will bubble up to the parent route (and be handled by the root route if necessary). By default, TanStack Router will attempt to handle the not-found error with the route that threw it.

### `throw` property

- Type: `boolean`
- Optional - `default: false`
- If provided, will throw the not-found object instead of returning it. This can be useful in places where `throwing` in a function might cause it to have a return type of `never`. In that case, you can use `notFound({ throw: true })` to throw the not-found object instead of returning it.
</file>

<file path="docs/react/api/router/notFoundFunction.md">
---
id: notFoundFunction
title: notFound function
---

The `notFound` function returns a new `NotFoundError` object that can be either returned or thrown from places like a Route's `beforeLoad` or `loader` callbacks to trigger the `notFoundComponent`.

## notFound options

The `notFound` function accepts a single optional argument, the `options` to create the not-found error object.

- Type: [`Partial<NotFoundError>`](../NotFoundErrorType.md)
- Optional

## notFound returns

- If the `throw` property is `true` in the `options` object, the `NotFoundError` object will be thrown from within the function call.
- If the `throw` property is `false | undefined` in the `options` object, the `NotFoundError` object will be returned.

## Examples

```tsx
import { notFound, createFileRoute, rootRouteId } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const Route = new createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  // throwing a not-found object
  loader: ({ context: { post } }) => {

- [`NavigateOptions`](../NavigateOptionsType.md)

## Redirect properties

The `Redirect` object accepts/contains the following properties:

### `statusCode` property

- Type: `number`
- Optional
- The HTTP status code to use when redirecting

### `throw` property

- Type: `any`
- Optional
- If provided, will throw the redirect object instead of returning it. This can be useful in places where `throwing` in a function might cause it to have a return type of `never`. In that case, you can use `redirect({ throw: true })` to throw the redirect object instead of returning it.

### `headers` property

- Type: `HeadersInit`
- Optional
- The HTTP headers to use when redirecting.

### Navigation Properties

Since `Redirect` extends `NavigateOptions`, it also supports navigation properties:

- **`to`**: Use for internal application routes (e.g., `/dashboard`, `../profile`)
- **`href`**: Use for external URLs (e.g., `https://example.com`, `https://authprovider.com`)

> **Important**: For external URLs, always use the `href` property instead of `to`. The `to` property is designed for internal navigation within your application.

This type is used to register a route tree with a router instance. Doing so unlocks the full type safety of TanStack Router, including top-level exports from the `@tanstack/react-router` package.

```tsx
export type Register = {
  // router: [Your router type here]
};
```

To register a route tree with a router instance, use declaration merging to add the type of your router instance to the Register interface under the `router` property:

## Examples

```tsx
const router = createRouter({
  // ...

<file path="docs/react/api/router/RouteOptionsType.md">
---
id: RouteOptionsType
title: RouteOptions type
---

The `RouteOptions` type is used to describe the options that can be used when creating a route.

## RouteOptions properties

The `RouteOptions` type accepts an object with the following properties:

### `getParentRoute` method

- Type: `() => TParentRoute`
- Required
- A function that returns the parent route of the route being created. This is required to provide full type safety to child route configurations and to ensure that the route tree is built correctly.

### `path` property

- Type: `string`
- Required, unless an `id` is provided to configure the route as a pathless layout route
- The path segment that will be used to match the route.

### `id` property

- Type: `string`
- Optional, but required if a `path` is not provided
- The unique identifier for the route if it is to be configured as a pathless layout route. If provided, the route will not match against the location pathname and its routes will be flattened into its parent route for matching.

### `component` property

- Type: `RouteComponent` or `LazyRouteComponent`
- Optional - Defaults to `<Outlet />`
- The content to be rendered when the route is matched.

### `errorComponent` property

- Type: `RouteComponent` or `LazyRouteComponent`
- Optional - Defaults to `routerOptions.defaultErrorComponent`
- The content to be rendered when the route encounters an error.

### `pendingComponent` property

- Type: `RouteComponent` or `LazyRouteComponent`
- Optional - Defaults to `routerOptions.defaultPendingComponent`
- The content to be rendered if and when the route is pending and has reached its pendingMs threshold.

### `notFoundComponent` property

- Type: `NotFoundRouteComponent` or `LazyRouteComponent`
- Optional - Defaults to `routerOptions.defaultNotFoundComponent`
- The content to be rendered when the route is not found.

### `validateSearch` method

- Type: `(rawSearchParams: unknown) => TSearchSchema`
- Optional
- A function that will be called when this route is matched and passed the raw search params from the current location and return valid parsed search params. If this function throws, the route will be put into an error state and the error will be thrown during render. If this function does not throw, its return value will be used as the route's search params and the return type will be inferred into the rest of the router.
- Optionally, the parameter type can be tagged with the `SearchSchemaInput` type like this: `(searchParams: TSearchSchemaInput & SearchSchemaInput) => TSearchSchema`. If this tag is present, `TSearchSchemaInput` will be used to type the `search` property of `<Link />` and `navigate()` **instead of** `TSearchSchema`. The difference between `TSearchSchemaInput` and `TSearchSchema` can be useful, for example, to express optional search parameters.

### `search.middlewares` property

- Type: `(({search: TSearchSchema, next: (newSearch: TSearchSchema) => TSearchSchema}) => TSearchSchema)[]`
- Optional
- Search middlewares are functions that transform the search parameters when generating new links for a route or its descendants.
- A search middleware is passed in the current search (if it is the first middleware to run) or is invoked by the previous middleware calling `next`.

### `parseParams` method (⚠️ deprecated, use `params.parse` instead)

- Type: `(rawParams: Record<string, string>) => TParams`
- Optional
- A function that will be called when this route is matched and passed the raw params from the current location and return valid parsed params. If this function throws, the route will be put into an error state and the error will be thrown during render. If this function does not throw, its return value will be used as the route's params and the return type will be inferred into the rest of the router.

### `stringifyParams` method (⚠️ deprecated, use `params.stringify` instead)

- Type: `(params: TParams) => Record<string, string>`
- Required if `parseParams` is provided
- A function that will be called when this route's parsed params are being used to build a location. This function should return a valid object of `Record<string, string>` mapping.

### `params.parse` method

- Type: `(rawParams: Record<string, string>) => TParams`
- Optional
- A function that will be called when this route is matched and passed the raw params from the current location and return valid parsed params. If this function throws, the route will be put into an error state and the error will be thrown during render. If this function does not throw, its return value will be used as the route's params and the return type will be inferred into the rest of the router.

### `params.stringify` method

- Type: `(params: TParams) => Record<string, string>`
- A function that will be called when this route's parsed params are being used to build a location. This function should return a valid object of `Record<string, string>` mapping.

### `beforeLoad` method

- Type:

```tsx
type beforeLoad = (
  opts: RouteMatch & {
    search: TFullSearchSchema;
    abortController: AbortController;
    preload: boolean;
    params: TAllParams;
    context: TParentContext;
    location: ParsedLocation;
    navigate: NavigateFn<AnyRoute>; // @deprecated
    buildLocation: BuildLocationFn<AnyRoute>;
    cause: "enter" | "stay";
  },
) => Promise<TRouteContext> | TRouteContext | void;
```

- Optional
- [`ParsedLocation`](../ParsedLocationType.md)
- This async function is called before a route is loaded. If an error is thrown here, the route's loader will not be called and the route will not render. If thrown during a navigation, the navigation will be canceled and the error will be passed to the `onError` function. If thrown during a preload event, the error will be logged to the console and the preload will fail.
- If this function returns a promise, the route will be put into a pending state and cause rendering to suspend until the promise resolves. If this route's pendingMs threshold is reached, the `pendingComponent` will be shown until it resolves. If the promise rejects, the route will be put into an error state and the error will be thrown during render.
- If this function returns a `TRouteContext` object, that object will be merged into the route's context and be made available in the `loader` and other related route components/methods.
- It's common to use this function to check if a user is authenticated and redirect them to a login page if they are not. To do this, you can either return or throw a `redirect` object from this function.

> 🚧 `opts.navigate` has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. Use `throw redirect({ to: '/somewhere' })` instead. Read more about the `redirect` function [here](../redirectFunction.md).

### `loader` method

- Type:

```tsx
type loader = (
  opts: RouteMatch & {
    abortController: AbortController;
    cause: "preload" | "enter" | "stay";
    context: TAllContext;
    deps: TLoaderDeps;
    location: ParsedLocation;
    params: TAllParams;
    preload: boolean;
    parentMatchPromise: Promise<MakeRouteMatchFromRoute<TParentRoute>>;
    navigate: NavigateFn<AnyRoute>; // @deprecated
    route: AnyRoute;
  },
) => Promise<TLoaderData> | TLoaderData | void;
```

- Optional
- [`ParsedLocation`](../ParsedLocationType.md)
- This async function is called when a route is matched and passed the route's match object. If an error is thrown here, the route will be put into an error state and the error will be thrown during render. If thrown during a navigation, the navigation will be canceled and the error will be passed to the `onError` function. If thrown during a preload event, the error will be logged to the console and the preload will fail.
- If this function returns a promise, the route will be put into a pending state and cause rendering to suspend until the promise resolves. If this route's pendingMs threshold is reached, the `pendingComponent` will be shown until it resolves. If the promise rejects, the route will be put into an error state and the error will be thrown during render.
- If this function returns a `TLoaderData` object, that object will be stored on the route match until the route match is no longer active. It can be accessed using the `useLoaderData` hook in any component that is a child of the route match before another `<Outlet />` is rendered.
- Deps must be returned by your `loaderDeps` function in order to appear.

> 🚧 `opts.navigate` has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. Use `throw redirect({ to: '/somewhere' })` instead. Read more about the `redirect` function [here](../redirectFunction.md).

### `loaderDeps` method

- Type:

```tsx
type loaderDeps = (opts: { search: TFullSearchSchema }) => Record<string, any>;
```

- Optional
- A function that will be called before this route is matched to provide additional unique identification to the route match and serve as a dependency tracker for when the match should be reloaded. It should return any serializable value that can uniquely identify the route match from navigation to navigation.
- By default, path params are already used to uniquely identify a route match, so it's unnecessary to return these here.
- If your route match relies on search params for unique identification, it's required that you return them here so they can be made available in the `loader`'s `deps` argument.

### `staleTime` property

- Type: `number`
- Optional
- Defaults to `routerOptions.defaultStaleTime`, which defaults to `0`
- The amount of time in milliseconds that a route match's loader data will be considered fresh. If a route match is matched again within this time frame, its loader data will not be reloaded.

### `preloadStaleTime` property

- Type: `number`
- Optional
- Defaults to `routerOptions.defaultPreloadStaleTime`, which defaults to `30_000` ms (30 seconds)
- The amount of time in milliseconds that a route match's loader data will be considered fresh when preloading. If a route match is preloaded again within this time frame, its loader data will not be reloaded. If a route match is loaded (for navigation) within this time frame, the normal `staleTime` is used instead.

### `gcTime` property

- Type: `number`
- Optional
- Defaults to `routerOptions.defaultGcTime`, which defaults to 30 minutes.
- The amount of time in milliseconds that a route match's loader data will be kept in memory after a preload or it is no longer in use.

### `shouldReload` property

- Type: `boolean | ((args: LoaderArgs) => boolean)`
- Optional
- If `false` or returns `false`, the route match's loader data will not be reloaded on subsequent matches.
- If `true` or returns `true`, the route match's loader data will be reloaded on subsequent matches.
- If `undefined` or returns `undefined`, the route match's loader data will adhere to the default stale-while-revalidate behavior.

### `caseSensitive` property

- Type: `boolean`
- Optional
- If `true`, this route will be matched as case-sensitive.

### `wrapInSuspense` property

- Type: `boolean`
- Optional
- If `true`, this route will be forcefully wrapped in a suspense boundary, regardless if a reason is found to do so from inspecting its provided components.

### `pendingMs` property

- Type: `number`
- Optional
- Defaults to `routerOptions.defaultPendingMs`, which defaults to `1000`
- The threshold in milliseconds that a route must be pending before its `pendingComponent` is shown.

### `pendingMinMs` property

- Type: `number`
- Optional
- Defaults to `routerOptions.defaultPendingMinMs` which defaults to `500`
- The minimum amount of time in milliseconds that the pending component will be shown for if it is shown. This is useful to prevent the pending component from flashing on the screen for a split second.

### `preloadMaxAge` property

- Type: `number`
- Optional
- Defaults to `30_000` ms (30 seconds)
- The maximum amount of time in milliseconds that a route's preloaded route data will be cached for. If a route is not matched within this time frame, its loader data will be discarded.

### `preSearchFilters` property (⚠️ deprecated, use `search.middlewares` instead)

- Type: `((search: TFullSearchSchema) => TFullSearchSchema)[]`
- Optional
- An array of functions that will be called when generating any new links to this route or its grandchildren.
- Each function will be called with the current search params and should return a new search params object that will be used to generate the link.
- It has a `pre` prefix because it is called before the user-provided function that is passed to `navigate`/`Link` etc has a chance to modify the search params.

### `postSearchFilters` property (⚠️ deprecated, use `search.middlewares` instead)

- Type: `((search: TFullSearchSchema) => TFullSearchSchema)[]`
- Optional
- An array of functions that will be called when generating any new links to this route or its grandchildren.
- Each function will be called with the current search params and should return a new search params object that will be used to generate the link.
- It has a `post` prefix because it is called after the user-provided function that is passed to `navigate`/`Link` etc has modified the search params.

### `onError` property

- Type: `(error: any) => void`
- Optional
- A function that will be called when an error is thrown during a navigation or preload event.
- If this function throws a [`redirect`](../redirectFunction.md), then the router will process and apply the redirect immediately.

### `onEnter` property

- Type: `(match: RouteMatch) => void`
- Optional
- A function that will be called when a route is matched and loaded after not being matched in the previous location.

### `onStay` property

- Type: `(match: RouteMatch) => void`
- Optional
- A function that will be called when a route is matched and loaded after being matched in the previous location.

### `onLeave` property

- Optional
- A function that will be called when a route is no longer matched after being matched in the previous location.

### `onCatch` property

- Type: `(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) => void`
- Optional - Defaults to `routerOptions.defaultOnCatch`
- A function that will be called when errors are caught when the route encounters an error.

### `remountDeps` method

- Type:

```tsx
type remountDeps = (opts: RemountDepsOptions) => any;

interface RemountDepsOptions<
  in out TRouteId,
  in out TFullSearchSchema,
  in out TAllParams,

> {
  routeId: TRouteId;
  search: TFullSearchSchema;
  params: TAllParams;
  loaderDeps: TLoaderDeps;
}
```

- Optional
- A function that will be called to determine whether a route component shall be remounted after navigation. If this function returns a different value than previously, it will remount.
- The return value needs to be JSON serializable.
- By default, a route component will not be remounted if it stays active after a navigation.

Example:
If you want to configure to remount a route component upon `params` change, use:

```tsx
remountDeps: ({ params }) => params;
```

### `headers` method

- Type:

```tsx
type headers = (opts: {
  matches: Array<RouteMatch>;
  match: RouteMatch;
  params: TAllParams;
  loaderData?: TLoaderData;
}) => Promise<Record<string, string>> | Record<string, string>;
```

- Optional
- Allows you to specify custom HTTP headers to be sent when this route is rendered during SSR. The function receives the current match context and should return a plain object of header name/value pairs.

### `head` method

- Type:

```tsx
type head = (ctx: {
  matches: Array<RouteMatch>;
  match: RouteMatch;
  params: TAllParams;
  loaderData?: TLoaderData;
}) =>
  | Promise<{
      links?: RouteMatch["links"];
      scripts?: RouteMatch["headScripts"];
      meta?: RouteMatch["meta"];
      styles?: RouteMatch["styles"];
    }>
  | {
      links?: RouteMatch["links"];
      scripts?: RouteMatch["headScripts"];
      meta?: RouteMatch["meta"];
      styles?: RouteMatch["styles"];
    };
```

- Optional
- Returns additional elements to inject into the document `<head>` for this route. Use it to add route-level SEO metadata, preload links, inline styles, or custom scripts.

### `scripts` method

- Type:

```tsx
type scripts = (ctx: {
  matches: Array<RouteMatch>;
  match: RouteMatch;
  params: TAllParams;
  loaderData?: TLoaderData;
}) => Promise<RouteMatch["scripts"]> | RouteMatch["scripts"];
```

- Optional
- A shorthand helper to return only `<script>` elements. Equivalent to returning the `scripts` field from the `head` method.

### `codeSplitGroupings` property

- Type: `Array<Array<'loader' | 'component' | 'pendingComponent' | 'notFoundComponent' | 'errorComponent'>>`
- Optional
- Fine-grained control over how the router groups lazy-loaded pieces of a route into chunks. Each inner array represents a group of assets that will be placed into the same bundle during code-splitting.

### `defaultPreloadGcTime` property

- Type: `number`
- Optional
- Defaults to `routerOptions.defaultGcTime`, which defaults to 30 minutes.
- The default `preloadGcTime` a route should use if no preloadGcTime is provided.

### `defaultGcTime` property

- Type: `number`
- Optional
- Defaults to 30 minutes.
- The default `gcTime` a route should use if no gcTime is provided.

### `defaultOnCatch` property

- Type: `(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) => void`
- Optional
- The default `onCatch` handler for errors caught by the Router ErrorBoundary

### `disableGlobalCatchBoundary` property

- Type: `boolean`
- Optional
- Defaults to `false`
- When `true`, disables the global catch boundary that normally wraps all route matches. This allows unhandled errors to bubble up to top-level error handlers in the browser.
- Useful for testing tools, error reporting services, and debugging scenarios.

### `defaultViewTransition` property

- Type: `boolean | ViewTransitionOptions`
- Optional
- If `true`, route navigations will be called using `document.startViewTransition()`.
- If [`ViewTransitionOptions`](../ViewTransitionOptionsType.md), route navigations will be called using `document.startViewTransition({update, types})`
  where `types` will be the strings array passed with `ViewTransitionOptions["types"]`. If the browser does not support viewTransition types,
  the navigation will fall back to normal `document.startTransition()`, same as if `true` was passed.
- If the browser does not support this api, this option will be ignored.
- See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/startViewTransition) for more information on how this function works.
- See [Google](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/same-document#view-transition-types) for more information on viewTransition types

### `defaultHashScrollIntoView` property

- Type: `boolean | ScrollIntoViewOptions`
- Optional
- Defaults to `true` so the element with an id matching the hash will be scrolled into view after the location is committed to history.
- If `false`, the element with an id matching the hash will not be scrolled into view after the location is committed to history.
- If an object is provided, it will be passed to the `scrollIntoView` method as options.
- See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView) for more information on `ScrollIntoViewOptions`.

### `caseSensitive` property

- Type: `boolean`

- Defaults to `false`
- If `true`, all routes will be matched as case-sensitive.

### `basepath` property

- Type: `string`
- Optional
- Defaults to `/`
- The basepath for the entire router. This is useful for mounting a router instance at a subpath.

### `context` property

- Type: `any`
- Optional or required if the root route was created with [`createRootRouteWithContext()`](../createRootRouteWithContextFunction.md).
- The root context that will be provided to all routes in the route tree. This can be used to provide a context to all routes in the tree without having to provide it to each route individually.

### `dehydrate` method

- Type: `() => TDehydrated`
- Optional
- A function that will be called when the router is dehydrated. The return value of this function will be serialized and stored in the router's dehydrated state.

### `routeMasks` property

- Type: `RouteMask[]`
- Optional
- An array of route masks that will be used to mask routes in the route tree. Route masking is when you display a route at a different path than the one it is configured to match, like a modal popup that when shared will unmask to the modal's content instead of the modal's context.

### `unmaskOnReload` property

- Type: `boolean`
- Optional
- Defaults to `false`
- If `true`, route masks will, by default, be removed when the page is reloaded. This can be overridden on a per-mask basis by setting the `unmaskOnReload` option on the mask, or on a per-navigation basis by setting the `unmaskOnReload` option in the `Navigate` options.

### `Wrap` property

- Type: `React.Component`
- Optional
- A component that will be used to wrap the entire router. This is useful for providing a context to the entire router. Only non-DOM-rendering components like providers should be used, anything else will cause a hydration error.

**Example**

```tsx
import { createRouter } from '@tanstack/react-router'

const router = createRouter({
  // ...
  Wrap: ({ children }) => {
    return <MyContext.Provider value={myContext}>{children}</MyContext>
  },
})
```

### `InnerWrap` property

- Type: `React.Component`
- Optional
- A component that will be used to wrap the inner contents of the router. This is useful for providing a context to the inner contents of the router where you also need access to the router context and hooks. Only non-DOM-rendering components like providers should be used, anything else will cause a hydration error.

**Example**

```tsx
import { createRouter } from '@tanstack/react-router'

const router = createRouter({
  // ...
  InnerWrap: ({ children }) => {
    const routerState = useRouterState()

    return (
      <MyContext.Provider value={myContext}>
        {children}
      </MyContext>
    )
  },
})
```

### `notFoundMode` property

- Type: `'root' | 'fuzzy'`
- Optional
- Defaults to `'fuzzy'`
- This property controls how TanStack Router will handle scenarios where it cannot find a route to match the current location. See the [Not Found Errors guide](../../../guide/not-found-errors.md) for more information.

### `notFoundRoute` property

- **Deprecated**
- Type: `NotFoundRoute`
- Optional
- A route that will be used as the default not found route for every branch of the route tree. This can be overridden on a per-branch basis by providing a not found route to the `NotFoundRoute` option on the root route of the branch.

### `trailingSlash` property

- Type: `'always' | 'never' | 'preserve'`
- Optional
- Defaults to `never`
- Configures how trailing slashes are treated. `'always'` will add a trailing slash if not present, `'never'` will remove the trailing slash if present and `'preserve'` will not modify the trailing slash.

### `pathParamsAllowedCharacters` property

- Type: `Array<';' | ':' | '@' | '&' | '=' | '+' | '$' | ','>`
- Optional
- Configures which URI characters are allowed in path params that would ordinarily be escaped by encodeURIComponent.

### `defaultStructuralSharing` property

- Type: `boolean`
- Optional
- Defaults to `false`
- Configures whether structural sharing is enabled by default for fine-grained selectors.
- See the [Render Optimizations guide](../../../guide/render-optimizations.md) for more information.

### `defaultRemountDeps` property

- Type:

```tsx
type defaultRemountDeps = (opts: RemountDepsOptions) => any;

interface RemountDepsOptions<
  in out TRouteId,
  in out TFullSearchSchema,
  in out TAllParams,
  in out TLoaderDeps,
> {
  routeId: TRouteId;
  search: TFullSearchSchema;
  params: TAllParams;
  loaderDeps: TLoaderDeps;
}
```

- Optional
- A default function that will be called to determine whether a route component shall be remounted after navigation. If this function returns a different value than previously, it will remount.
- The return value needs to be JSON serializable.
- By default, a route component will not be remounted if it stays active after a navigation

Example:  
If you want to configure to remount all route components upon `params` change, use:

```tsx
remountDeps: ({ params }) => params;
```

The `RouterState` type represents shape of the internal state of the router. The Router's internal state is useful, if you need to access certain internals of the router, such as any pending matches, is the router in its loading state, etc.

```tsx
type RouterState = {
  status: "pending" | "idle";
  isLoading: boolean;
  isTransitioning: boolean;
  matches: Array<RouteMatch>;
  pendingMatches: Array<RouteMatch>;
  location: ParsedLocation;
  resolvedLocation: ParsedLocation;
};
```

## RouterState properties

The `RouterState` type contains all of the properties that are available on the router state.

### `status` property

- Type: `'pending' | 'idle'`
- The current status of the router. If the router is pending, it means that it is currently loading a route or the router is still transitioning to the new route.

### `isLoading` property

- Type: `boolean`
- `true` if the router is currently loading a route or waiting for a route to finish loading.

### `isTransitioning` property

- Type: `boolean`
- `true` if the router is currently transitioning to a new route.

### `matches` property

- Type: [`Array<RouteMatch>`](../RouteMatchType.md)
- An array of all of the route matches that have been resolved and are currently active.

### `pendingMatches` property

- Type: [`Array<RouteMatch>`](../RouteMatchType.md)
- An array of all of the route matches that are currently pending.

### `location` property

- Type: [`ParsedLocation`](../ParsedLocationType.md)
- The latest location that the router has parsed from the browser history. This location may not be resolved and loaded yet.

### `resolvedLocation` property

- Type: [`ParsedLocation`](../ParsedLocationType.md)
- The location that the router has resolved and loaded.

  - `hashScrollIntoView`
    - Type: `boolean | ScrollIntoViewOptions`
    - Optional
    - Defaults to `true` so the element with an id matching the hash will be scrolled into view after the location is committed to history.

    - See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView) for more information on `ScrollIntoViewOptions`.
  - `ignoreBlocker`
    - Type: `boolean`
    - Optional
    - Defaults to `false`.
    - If `true`, navigation will ignore any blockers that might prevent it.

### `.navigate` method

Navigates to a new location.

- Type
  ```tsx
  type navigate = (options: NavigateOptions) => Promise<void>;
  ```

### `.invalidate` method

Invalidates route matches by forcing their `beforeLoad` and `load` functions to be called again.

- Type: `(opts?: {filter?: (d: MakeRouteMatchUnion<TRouter>) => boolean, sync?: boolean, forcePending?: boolean }) => Promise<void>`
- This is useful any time your loader data might be out of date or stale. For example, if you have a route that displays a list of posts, and you have a loader function that fetches the list of posts from an API, you might want to invalidate the route matches for that route any time a new post is created so that the list of posts is always up-to-date.
- if `filter` is not supplied, all matches will be invalidated
- if `filter` is supplied, only matches for which `filter` returns `true` will be invalidated.
- if `sync` is true, the promise returned by this function will only resolve once all loaders have finished.
- if `forcePending` is true, the invalidated matches will be put into `'pending'` state regardless whether they are in `'error'` state or not.
- You might also want to invalidate the Router if you imperatively `reset` the router's `CatchBoundary` to trigger loaders again.

### `.clearCache` method

Remove cached route matches.

- Type: `(opts?: {filter?: (d: MakeRouteMatchUnion<TRouter>) => boolean}) => void`
- if `filter` is not supplied, all cached matches will be removed
- if `filter` is supplied, only matches for which `filter` returns `true` will be removed.

### `.load` method

Loads all of the currently matched route matches and resolves when they are all loaded and ready to be rendered.

> ⚠️⚠️⚠️ **`router.load()` respects `route.staleTime` and will not forcefully reload a route match if it is still fresh. If you need to forcefully reload a route match, use `router.invalidate()` instead.**

- Type: `(opts?: {sync?: boolean}) => Promise<void>`
- if `sync` is true, the promise returned by this function will only resolve once all loaders have finished.
- The most common use case for this method is to call it when doing SSR to ensure that all of the critical data for the current route is loaded before attempting to stream or render the application to the client.

### `.preloadRoute` method

Preloads all of the matches that match the provided `NavigateOptions`.

> ⚠️⚠️⚠️ **Preloaded route matches are not stored long-term in the router state. They are only stored until the next attempted navigation action.**

- Type: `(opts?: NavigateOptions) => Promise<RouteMatch[]>`
- Properties
  - `opts`
    - Type: `NavigateOptions`
    - Optional, defaults to the current location.
    - The options that will be used to determine which route matches to preload.
- Returns
  - A promise that resolves with an array of all of the route matches that were preloaded.

### `.loadRouteChunk` method

Loads the JS chunk of the route.

- Type: `(route: AnyRoute) => Promise<void>`

### `.matchRoute` method

Matches a pathname and search params against the router's route tree and returns a route match's params or false if no match was found.

- Type: `(dest: ToOptions, matchOpts?: MatchRouteOptions) => RouteMatch['params'] | false`
- Properties
  - `dest`
    - Type: `ToOptions`
    - Required
    - The destination to match against.
  - `matchOpts`
    - Type: `MatchRouteOptions`
    - Optional
    - Options that will be used to match the destination.
- Returns
  - A route match's params if a match was found.
  - `false` if no match was found.

### `.dehydrate` method

Dehydrates the router's critical state into a serializable object that can be sent to the client in an initial request.

- Type: `() => DehydratedRouter`
- Returns
  - A serializable object that contains the router's critical state.

### `.hydrate` method

Hydrates the router's critical state from a serializable object that was sent from the server in an initial request.

- Type: `(dehydrated: DehydratedRouter) => void`
- Properties
  - `dehydrated`
    - Type: `DehydratedRouter`
    - Required

id: stripSearchParams
title: Search middleware to strip search params
---

`stripSearchParams` is a search middleware that allows to remove search params.

## stripSearchParams props

`stripSearchParams` accepts one of the following inputs:

- `true`: if the search schema has no required params, `true` can be used to strip all search params
- a list of keys of those search params that shall be removed; only keys of optional search params are allowed.
- an object that conforms to the partial input search schema. The search params are compared against the values of this object; if the value is deeply equal, it will be removed. This is especially useful to strip out default search params.

## Examples

```tsx
import { z } from "zod";
import { createFileRoute, stripSearchParams } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { zodValidator } from "@tanstack/zod-adapter";

const defaultValues = {
  one: "abc",
  two: "xyz",

## useAwaited options

The `useAwaited` hook accepts a single argument, an `options` object.

### `options.promise` option

- Type: `Promise<T>`
- Required
- The deferred promise to await.

## useAwaited returns

- Throws an error if the promise is rejected.
- Suspends (throws a promise) if the promise is pending.

The `useBlocker` method is a hook that [blocks navigation](../../../guide/navigation-blocking.md) when a condition is met.

> ⚠️ The following new `useBlocker` API is currently _experimental_.

## useBlocker options

The `useBlocker` hook accepts a single _required_ argument, an option object:

### `options.shouldBlockFn` option

- Required
- Type: `ShouldBlockFn`
- This function should return a `boolean` or a `Promise<boolean>` that tells the blocker if it should block the current navigation
- The function has the argument of type `ShouldBlockFnArgs` passed to it, which tells you information about the current and next route and the action performed
- Think of this function as telling the router if it should block the navigation, so returning `true` mean that it should block the navigation and `false` meaning that it should be allowed

```ts
interface ShouldBlockFnLocation<...> {
  routeId: TRouteId
  fullPath: TFullPath
  pathname: string
  params: TAllParams
  search: TFullSearchSchema
}

type ShouldBlockFnArgs = {
  current: ShouldBlockFnLocation
  next: ShouldBlockFnLocation
  action: HistoryAction
}
```

### `options.disabled` option

- Optional - defaults to `false`
- Type: `boolean`
- Specifies if the blocker should be entirely disabled or not

### `options.enableBeforeUnload` option

- Optional - defaults to `true`
- Type: `boolean | (() => boolean)`
- Tell the blocker to sometimes or always block the browser `beforeUnload` event or not

### `options.withResolver` option

- Optional - defaults to `false`
- Type: `boolean`
- Specify if the resolver returned by the hook should be used or whether your `shouldBlockFn` function itself resolves the blocking

### `options.blockerFn` option (⚠️ deprecated)

- Optional
- Type: `BlockerFn`
- The function that returns a `boolean` or `Promise<boolean>` indicating whether to allow navigation.

### `options.condition` option (⚠️ deprecated)

- Optional - defaults to `true`
- Type: `boolean`
- A navigation attempt is blocked when this condition is `true`.

## useBlocker returns

An object with the controls to allow manual blocking and unblocking of navigation.

- `status` - A string literal that can be either `'blocked'` or `'idle'`
- `next` - When status is `blocked`, a type narrrowable object that contains information about the next location
- `current` - When status is `blocked`, a type narrrowable object that contains information about the current location
- `action` - When status is `blocked`, a `HistoryAction` string that shows the action that triggered the navigation
- `proceed` - When status is `blocked`, a function that allows navigation to continue
- `reset` - When status is `blocked`, a function that cancels navigation (`status` will be reset to `'idle'`)

or

`void` when `withResolver` is `false`

## Examples

Two common use cases for the `useBlocker` hook are:

### Basic usage

```tsx
import { useBlocker } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function MyComponent() {
  const [formIsDirty, setFormIsDirty] = useState(false);

  useBlocker({
    shouldBlockFn: () => formIsDirty,
  });

  // ...
}
```

### Custom UI

```tsx
import { useBlocker } from '@tanstack/react-router'

function MyComponent() {
  const [formIsDirty, setFormIsDirty] = useState(false)

  const { proceed, reset, status, next } = useBlocker({
    shouldBlockFn: () => formIsDirty,
    withResolver: true,
  })

  // ...

  return (
    <>
      {/* ... */}
      {status === 'blocked' && (

### Type narrowing

```tsx

id: useCanGoBack
title: useCanGoBack hook
---

The `useCanGoBack` hook returns a boolean representing if the router history can safely go back without exiting the application.

> ⚠️ The following new `useCanGoBack` API is currently _experimental_.

## useCanGoBack returns

- If the router history is not at index `0`, `true`.
- If the router history is at index `0`, `false`.

## Limitations

The router history index is reset after a navigation with [`reloadDocument`](../NavigateOptionsType.md#reloaddocument) set as `true`. This causes the router history to consider the new location as the initial one and will cause `useCanGoBack` to return `false`.

## Examples

### Showing a back button

```tsx
import { useRouter, useCanGoBack } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function Component() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const canGoBack = useCanGoBack();

  return (
    <div>

> ⚠️⚠️⚠️ **`router.state` is always up to date, but NOT REACTIVE. If you use `router.state` in a component, the component will not re-render when the router state changes. To get a reactive version of the router state, use the [`useRouterState`](../useRouterStateHook.md) hook.**

## Examples

```tsx
import { useRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function Component() {
  const router = useRouter();
  //    ^ Router

  // ...
}
```

id: useRouterStateHook
title: useRouterState hook
---

The `useRouterState` method is a hook that returns the current internal state of the router. This hook is useful for accessing the current state of the router in a component.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to access the current location or the current matches, you should try out the [`useLocation`](../useLocationHook.md) and [`useMatches`](../useMatchesHook.md) hooks first. These hooks are designed to be more ergonomic and easier to use than accessing the router state directly.

## useRouterState options

The `useRouterState` hook accepts an optional `options` object.

### `opts.select` option

- Type: `(state: RouterState) => TSelected`
- Optional
- If supplied, this function will be called with the [`RouterState`](../RouterStateType.md) object and the return value will be returned from `useRouterState`.

### `opts.structuralSharing` option

- Type: `boolean`
- Optional
- Configures whether structural sharing is enabled for the value returned by `select`.
- See the [Render Optimizations guide](../../../guide/render-optimizations.md) for more information.

## useRouterState returns

- The current [`RouterState`](../RouterStateType.md) object or `TSelected` if a `select` function is provided.

## Examples

```tsx
import { useRouterState } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function Component() {
  const state = useRouterState();
  //    ^ RouterState

  // OR

  const selected = useRouterState({
    select: (state) => state.location,
  });
  //    ^ ParsedLocation

  // ...
}
```

id: useSearchHook
title: useSearch hook
---

The `useSearch` method is a hook that returns the current search query parameters as an object for the current location. This hook is useful for accessing the current search string and query parameters in a component.

## useSearch options

The `useSearch` hook accepts an `options` object.

### `opts.from` option

- Type: `string`
- Required
- The RouteID to match the search query parameters from.

### `opts.shouldThrow` option

- Type: `boolean`
- Optional
- `default: true`
- If `false`,`useSearch` will not throw an invariant exception in case a match was not found in the currently rendered matches; in this case, it will return `undefined`.

### `opts.select` option

- Type: `(search: SelectedSearchSchema) => TSelected`
- Optional
- If supplied, this function will be called with the search object and the return value will be returned from `useSearch`.

### `opts.structuralSharing` option

- Type: `boolean`
- Optional
- Configures whether structural sharing is enabled for the value returned by `select`.
- See the [Render Optimizations guide](../../../guide/render-optimizations.md) for more information.

### `opts.strict` option

- Type: `boolean`
- Optional - `default: true`
- If `false`, the `opts.from` option will be ignored and types will be loosened to `Partial<FullSearchSchema>` to reflect the shared types of all search query parameters.

## useSearch returns

- If `opts.from` is provided, an object of the search query parameters for the current location or `TSelected` if a `select` function is provided.
- If `opts.strict` is `false`, an object of the search query parameters for the current location or `TSelected` if a `select` function is provided.

## Examples

```tsx
import { useSearch } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function Component() {
  const search = useSearch({ from: "/posts/$postId" });
  //    ^ FullSearchSchema

  // OR

  const selected = useSearch({
    from: "/posts/$postId",
    select: (search) => search.postView,
  });
  //    ^ string

  // OR

  const looseSearch = useSearch({ strict: false });
  //    ^ Partial<FullSearchSchema>

  // ...
}

id: authenticated-routes
title: Authenticated Routes
---

Authentication is an extremely common requirement for web applications. In this guide, we'll walk through how to use TanStack Router to build protected routes, and how to redirect users to login if they try to access them.

## The `route.beforeLoad` Option

The `route.beforeLoad` option allows you to specify a function that will be called before a route is loaded. It receives all of the same arguments that the `route.loader` function does. This is a great place to check if a user is authenticated, and redirect them to a login page if they are not.

The `beforeLoad` function runs in relative order to these other route loading functions:

- Route Matching (Top-Down)
  - `route.params.parse`
  - `route.validateSearch`
- Route Loading (including Preloading)
  - **`route.beforeLoad`**
  - `route.onError`
- Route Loading (Parallel)
  - `route.component.preload?`
  - `route.load`

**It's important to know that the `beforeLoad` function for a route is called _before any of its child routes' `beforeLoad` functions_.** It is essentially a middleware function for the route and all of its children.

**If you throw an error in `beforeLoad`, none of its children will attempt to load**.

## Redirecting

While not required, some authentication flows require redirecting to a login page. To do this, you can **throw a `redirect()`** from `beforeLoad`:

```tsx
// src/routes/_authenticated.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/_authenticated")({
  beforeLoad: async ({ location }) => {
    if (!isAuthenticated()) {
      throw redirect({
        to: "/login",
        search: {
          // Use the current location to power a redirect after login
          // (Do not use `router.state.resolvedLocation` as it can
          // potentially lag behind the actual current location)
          redirect: location.href,
        },
      });
    }
  },
});
```

> [!TIP]
> The `redirect()` function takes all of the same options as the `navigate` function, so you can pass options like `replace: true` if you want to replace the current history entry instead of adding a new one.

Once you have authenticated a user, it's also common practice to redirect them back to the page they were trying to access. To do this, you can utilize the `redirect` search param that we added in our original redirect. Since we'll be replacing the entire URL with what it was, `router.history.push` is better suited for this than `router.navigate`:

```tsx
router.history.push(search.redirect);
```

## Non-Redirected Authentication

Some applications choose to not redirect users to a login page, and instead keep the user on the same page and show a login form that either replaces the main content or hides it via a modal. This is also possible with TanStack Router by simply short circuiting rendering the `<Outlet />` that would normally render the child routes:

```tsx
// src/routes/_authenticated.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/_authenticated")({
  component: () => {
    if (!isAuthenticated()) {
      return <Login />;
    }

    return <Outlet />;
  },
});
```

This keeps the user on the same page, but still allows you to render a login form. Once the user is authenticated, you can simply render the `<Outlet />` and the child routes will be rendered.

## Authentication using React context/hooks

If your authentication flow relies on interactions with React context and/or hooks, you'll need to pass down your authentication state to TanStack Router using `router.context` option.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> React hooks are not meant to be consumed outside of React components. If you need to use a hook outside of a React component, you need to extract the returned state from the hook in a component that wraps your `<RouterProvider />` and then pass the returned value down to TanStack Router.

We'll cover the `router.context` options in-detail in the [Router Context](../router-context.md) section.

Here's an example that uses React context and hooks for protecting authenticated routes in TanStack Router. See the entire working setup in the [Authenticated Routes example](https://github.com/TanStack/router/tree/main/examples/react/authenticated-routes).

- `src/routes/__root.tsx`

```tsx
import { createRootRouteWithContext } from "@tanstack/react-router";

interface MyRouterContext {
  // The ReturnType of your useAuth hook or the value of your AuthContext
  auth: AuthState;
}

export const Route = createRootRouteWithContext<MyRouterContext>()({
  component: () => <Outlet />,
});
```

- `src/router.tsx`

```tsx
import { createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

export const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
  context: {
    // auth will initially be undefined
    // We'll be passing down the auth state from within a React component
    auth: undefined!,
  },
});
```

- `src/App.tsx`

```tsx
import { RouterProvider } from "@tanstack/react-router";

import { AuthProvider, useAuth } from "./auth";

import { router } from "./router";

function InnerApp() {
  const auth = useAuth();
  return <RouterProvider router={router} context={{ auth }} />;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <AuthProvider>
      <InnerApp />
    </AuthProvider>
  );
}
```

Then in the authenticated route, you can check the auth state using the `beforeLoad` function, and **throw a `redirect()`** to your **Login route** if the user is not signed-in.

- `src/routes/dashboard.route.tsx`

```tsx
import { createFileRoute, redirect } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/dashboard")({
  beforeLoad: ({ context, location }) => {
    if (!context.auth.isAuthenticated) {
      throw redirect({
        to: "/login",
        search: {
          redirect: location.href,
        },
      });
    }
  },
});
```

You can _optionally_, also use the [Non-Redirected Authentication](#non-redirected-authentication) approach to show a login form instead of calling a **redirect**.

This approach can also be used in conjunction with Pathless or Layout Route to protect all routes under their parent route.

title: Automatic Code Splitting
---

The automatic code splitting feature in TanStack Router allows you to optimize your application's bundle size by lazily loading route components and their associated data. This is particularly useful for large applications where you want to minimize the initial load time by only loading the necessary code for the current route.

To turn this feature on, simply set the `autoCodeSplitting` option to `true` in your bundler plugin configuration. This enables the router to automatically handle code splitting for your routes without requiring any additional setup.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { tanstackRouter } from "@tanstack/router-plugin/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tanstackRouter({
      autoCodeSplitting: true, // Enable automatic code splitting
    }),
  ],
});
```

But that's just the beginning! TanStack Router's automatic code splitting is not only easy to enable, but it also provides powerful customization options to tailor how your routes are split into chunks. This allows you to optimize your application's performance based on your specific needs and usage patterns.

## How does it work?

TanStack Router's automatic code splitting works by transforming your route files both during 'development' and at 'build' time. It rewrites the route definitions to use lazy-loading wrappers for components and loaders, which allows the bundler to group these properties into separate chunks.

> [!TIP]
> A **chunk** is a file that contains a portion of your application's code, which can be loaded on demand. This helps reduce the initial load time of your application by only loading the code that is needed for the current route.

So when your application loads, it doesn't include all the code for every route. Instead, it only includes the code for the routes that are initially needed. As users navigate through your application, additional chunks are loaded on demand.

This happens seamlessly, without requiring you to manually split your code or manage lazy loading. The TanStack Router bundler plugin takes care of everything, ensuring that your routes are optimized for performance right out of the box.

### The transformation process

When you enable automatic code splitting, the bundler plugin does this by using static code analysis look at your the code in your route files to transform them into optimized outputs.

This transformation process produces two key outputs when each of your route files are processed:

1. **Reference File**: The bundler plugin takes your original route file (e.g., `posts.route.tsx`) and modifies the values for properties like `component` or `pendingComponent` to use special lazy-loading wrappers that'll fetch the actual code later. These wrappers point to a "virtual" file that the bundler will resolve later on.
2. **Virtual File**: When the bundler sees a request for one of these virtual files (e.g., `posts.route.tsx?tsr-split=component`), it intercepts it to generate a new, minimal on-the-fly file that _only_ contains the code for the requested properties (e.g., just the `PostsComponent`).

This process ensures that your original code remains clean and readable, while the actual bundled output is optimized for initial bundle size.

### What gets code split?

The decision of what to split into separate chunks is crucial for optimizing your application's performance. TanStack Router uses a concept called "**Split Groupings**" to determine how different parts of your route should be bundled together.

Split groupings are arrays of properties that tell TanStack Router how to bundle different parts of your route together. Each grouping is an list of property names that you want to bundle together into a single lazy-loaded chunk.

The available properties to split are:

- `component`
- `errorComponent`
- `pendingComponent`
- `notFoundComponent`
- `loader`

By default, TanStack Router uses the following split groupings:

```sh
[
  ['component'],
  ['errorComponent'],
  ['notFoundComponent']
]
```

This means that it creates three separate lazy-loaded chunks for each route. Resulting in:

- One for the main component
- One for the error component
- And one for the not-found component.

## Granular control

For most applications, the default behavior of using `autoCodeSplitting: true` is sufficient. However, TanStack Router provides several options to customize how your routes are split into chunks, allowing you to optimize for specific use cases or performance needs.

### Global code splitting behavior (`defaultBehavior`)

You can change how TanStack Router splits your routes by changing the `defaultBehavior` option in your bundler plugin configuration. This allows you to define how different properties of your routes should be bundled together.

For example, to bundle all UI-related components into a single chunk, you could configure it like this:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { tanstackRouter } from "@tanstack/router-plugin/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tanstackRouter({
      autoCodeSplitting: true,
      codeSplittingOptions: {
        defaultBehavior: [
          ["component", "pendingComponent", "errorComponent", "notFoundComponent"], // Bundle all UI components together
        ],
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Advanced programmatic control (`splitBehavior`)

For complex rulesets, you can use the `splitBehavior` function in your vite config to programmatically define how routes should be split into chunks based on their `routeId`. This function allows you to implement custom logic for grouping properties together, giving you fine-grained control over the code splitting behavior.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { tanstackRouter } from "@tanstack/router-plugin/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tanstackRouter({
      autoCodeSplitting: true,
      codeSplittingOptions: {
        splitBehavior: ({ routeId }) => {
          // For all routes under /posts, bundle the loader and component together
          if (routeId.startsWith("/posts")) {
            return [["loader", "component"]];
          }
          // All other routes will use the `defaultBehavior`
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Per-route overrides (`codeSplitGroupings`)

For ultimate control, you can override the global configuration directly inside a route file by adding a `codeSplitGroupings` property. This is useful for routes that have unique optimization needs.

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.route.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { loadPostsData } from "./-heavy-posts-utils";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  // For this specific route, bundle the loader and component together.
  codeSplitGroupings: [["loader", "component"]],
  loader: () => loadPostsData(),
  component: PostsComponent,
});

function PostsComponent() {
  // ...
}
```

This will create a single chunk that includes both the `loader` and the `component` for this specific route, overriding both the default behavior and any programmatic split behavior defined in your bundler config.

### Configuration order matters

This guide has so far describe three different ways to configure how TanStack Router splits your routes into chunks.

To make sure that the different configurations do not conflict with each other, TanStack Router uses the following order of precedence:

1. **Per-route overrides**: The `codeSplitGroupings` property inside a route file takes the highest precedence. This allows you to define specific split groupings for individual routes.
2. **Programmatic split behavior**: The `splitBehavior` function in your bundler config allows you to define custom logic for how routes should be split based on their `routeId`.
3. **Default behavior**: The `defaultBehavior` option in your bundler config serves as the fallback for any routes that do not have specific overrides or custom logic defined. This is the base configuration that applies to all routes unless overridden.

### Splitting the Data Loader

The `loader` function is responsible for fetching data needed by the route. By default, it is bundled with into your "reference file" and loaded in the initial bundle. However, you can also split the `loader` into its own chunk if you want to optimize further.

> [!CAUTION]
> Moving the `loader` into its own chunk is a **performance trade-off**. It introduces an additional trip to the server before the data can be fetched, which can lead to slower initial page loads. This is because the `loader` **must** be fetched and executed before the route can render its component.
> Therefore, we recommend keeping the `loader` in the initial bundle unless you have a specific reason to split it.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { tanstackRouter } from "@tanstack/router-plugin/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tanstackRouter({
      autoCodeSplitting: true,
      codeSplittingOptions: {
        defaultBehavior: [
          ["loader"], // The loader will be in its own chunk
          ["component"],
          // ... other component groupings
        ],
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

We highly discourage splitting the `loader` unless you have a specific use case that requires it. In most cases, not splitting off the `loader` and keep it in the main bundle is the best choice for performance.

title: Code Splitting
---

Code splitting and lazy loading is a powerful technique for improving the bundle size and load performance of an application.

- Reduces the amount of code that needs to be loaded on initial page load
- Code is loaded on-demand when it is needed
- Results in more chunks that are smaller in size that can be cached more easily by the browser.

## How does TanStack Router split code?

TanStack Router separates code into two categories:

- **Critical Route Configuration** - The code that is required to render the current route and kick off the data loading process as early as possible.
  - Path Parsing/Serialization
  - Search Param Validation
  - Loaders, Before Load
  - Route Context
  - Static Data
  - Links
  - Scripts
  - Styles
  - All other route configuration not listed below

- **Non-Critical/Lazy Route Configuration** - The code that is not required to match the route, and can be loaded on-demand.
  - Route Component
  - Error Component
  - Pending Component
  - Not-found Component

> 🧠 **Why is the loader not split?**
>
> - The loader is already an asynchronous boundary, so you pay double to both get the chunk _and_ wait for the loader to execute.
> - Categorically, it is less likely to contribute to a large bundle size than a component.
> - The loader is one of the most important preloadable assets for a route, especially if you're using a default preload intent, like hovering over a link, so it's important for the loader to be available without any additional async overhead.
>
>   Knowing the disadvantages of splitting the loader, if you still want to go ahead with it, head over to the [Data Loader Splitting](#data-loader-splitting) section.

## Encapsulating a route's files into a directory

Since TanStack Router's file-based routing system is designed to support both flat and nested file structures, it's possible to encapsulate a route's files into a single directory without any additional configuration.

To encapsulate a route's files into a directory, move the route file itself into a `.route` file within a directory with the same name as the route file.

For example, if you have a route file named `posts.tsx`, you would create a new directory named `posts` and move the `posts.tsx` file into that directory, renaming it to `route.tsx`.

**Before**

- `posts.tsx`

**After**

- `posts`
  - `route.tsx`

## Approaches to code splitting

TanStack Router supports multiple approaches to code splitting. If you are using code-based routing, skip to the [Code-Based Splitting](#code-based-splitting) section.

When you are using file-based routing, you can use the following approaches to code splitting:

- [Using automatic code-splitting ✨](#using-automatic-code-splitting)
- [Using the `.lazy.tsx` suffix](#using-the-lazytsx-suffix)
- [Using Virtual Routes](#using-virtual-routes)

## Using automatic code-splitting✨

This is the easiest and most powerful way to code split your route files.

When using the `autoCodeSplitting` feature, TanStack Router will automatically code split your route files based on the non-critical route configuration mentioned above.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The automatic code-splitting feature is **ONLY** available when you are using file-based routing with one of our [supported bundlers](../../routing/file-based-routing.md#getting-started-with-file-based-routing).
> This will **NOT** work if you are **only** using the CLI (`@tanstack/router-cli`).

To enable automatic code-splitting, you just need to add the following to the configuration of your TanStack Router Bundler Plugin:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { tanstackRouter } from "@tanstack/router-plugin/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tanstackRouter({
      // ...
      autoCodeSplitting: true,
    }),
    react(), // Make sure to add this plugin after the TanStack Router Bundler plugin
  ],
});
```

That's it! TanStack Router will automatically code-split all your route files by their critical and non-critical route configurations.

If you want more control over the code-splitting process, head over to the [Automatic Code Splitting](../automatic-code-splitting.md) guide to learn more about the options available.

## Using the `.lazy.tsx` suffix

If you are not able to use the automatic code-splitting feature, you can still code-split your route files using the `.lazy.tsx` suffix. It is **as easy as moving your code into a separate file with a `.lazy.tsx` suffix** and using the `createLazyFileRoute` function instead of `createFileRoute`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `__root.tsx` route file, using either `createRootRoute` or `createRootRouteWithContext`, does not support code splitting, since it's always rendered regardless of the current route.

These are the only options that `createLazyFileRoute` support:

| Export Name         | Description                                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `component`         | The component to render for the route.                                |
| `errorComponent`    | The component to render when an error occurs while loading the route. |
| `pendingComponent`  | The component to render while the route is loading.                   |
| `notFoundComponent` | The component to render if a not-found error gets thrown.             |

### Example code splitting with `.lazy.tsx`

When you are using `.lazy.tsx` you can split your route into two files to enable code splitting:

**Before (Single File)**

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { fetchPosts } from "./api";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  loader: fetchPosts,
  component: Posts,
});

function Posts() {
  // ...
}
```

**After (Split into two files)**

This file would contain the critical route configuration:

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.tsx

import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { fetchPosts } from "./api";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  loader: fetchPosts,
});
```

With the non-critical route configuration going into the file with the `.lazy.tsx` suffix:

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.lazy.tsx
import { createLazyFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createLazyFileRoute("/posts")({
  component: Posts,
});

function Posts() {
  // ...
}
```

## Using Virtual Routes

You might run into a situation where you end up splitting out everything from a route file, leaving it empty! In this case, simply **delete the route file entirely**! A virtual route will automatically be generated for you to serve as an anchor for your code split files. This virtual route will live directly in the generated route tree file.

**Before (Virtual Routes)**

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  // Hello?
});
```

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.lazy.tsx
import { createLazyFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createLazyFileRoute("/posts")({
  component: Posts,
});

function Posts() {
  // ...
}
```

**After (Virtual Routes)**

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.lazy.tsx
import { createLazyFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createLazyFileRoute("/posts")({
  component: Posts,
});

function Posts() {
  // ...
}
```

Tada! 🎉

## Code-Based Splitting

If you are using code-based routing, you can still code-split your routes using the `Route.lazy()` method and the `createLazyRoute` function. You'll need to split your route configuration into two parts:

Create a lazy route using the `createLazyRoute` function.

```tsx
// src/posts.lazy.tsx
export const Route = createLazyRoute("/posts")({
  component: MyComponent,
});

function MyComponent() {
  return <div>My Component</div>;
}
```

Then, call the `.lazy` method on the route definition in your `app.tsx` to import the lazy/code-split route with the non-critical route configuration.

```tsx
// src/app.tsx
const postsRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "/posts",
}).lazy(() => import("./posts.lazy").then((d) => d.Route));
```

## Data Loader Splitting

**Be warned!!!** Splitting a route loader is a dangerous game.

It can be a powerful tool to reduce bundle size, but it comes with a cost as mentioned in the [How does TanStack Router split code?](#how-does-tanstack-router-split-code) section.

You can code split your data loading logic using the Route's `loader` option. While this process makes it difficult to maintain type-safety with the parameters passed to your loader, you can always use the generic `LoaderContext` type to get you most of the way there:

```tsx
import { lazyFn } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const route = createRoute({
  path: "/my-route",
  component: MyComponent,
  loader: lazyFn(() => import("./loader"), "loader"),
});

// In another file...a
export const loader = async (context: LoaderContext) => {
  /// ...
};
```

If you are using file-based routing, you'll only be able to split your `loader` if you are using [Automatic Code Splitting](#using-automatic-code-splitting) with customized bundling options.

## Manually accessing Route APIs in other files with the `getRouteApi` helper

As you might have guessed, placing your component code in a separate file than your route can make it difficult to consume the route itself. To help with this, TanStack Router exports a handy `getRouteApi` function that you can use to access a route's type-safe APIs in a file without importing the route itself.

- `my-route.tsx`

```tsx
import { createRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { MyComponent } from "./MyComponent";

const route = createRoute({
  path: "/my-route",
  loader: () => ({
    foo: "bar",
  }),
  component: MyComponent,
});
```

- `MyComponent.tsx`

```tsx
import { getRouteApi } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const route = getRouteApi("/my-route");

export function MyComponent() {
  const loaderData = route.useLoaderData();
  //    ^? { foo: string }

  return <div>...</div>;
}
```

The `getRouteApi` function is useful for accessing other type-safe APIs:

- `useLoaderData`
- `useLoaderDeps`
- `useMatch`
- `useParams`
- `useRouteContext`
- `useSearch`
</file>

title: Creating a Router
---

## The `Router` Class

When you're ready to start using your router, you'll need to create a new `Router` instance. The router instance is the core brains of TanStack Router and is responsible for managing the route tree, matching routes, and coordinating navigations and route transitions. It also serves as a place to configure router-wide settings.

```tsx
import { createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const router = createRouter({
  // ...
});
```

## Route Tree

You'll probably notice quickly that the `Router` constructor requires a `routeTree` option. This is the route tree that the router will use to match routes and render components.

Whether you used [file-based routing](../../routing/file-based-routing.md) or [code-based routing](../../routing/code-based-routing.md), you'll need to pass your route tree to the `createRouter` function:

### Filesystem Route Tree

If you used our recommended file-based routing, then it's likely your generated route tree file was created at the default `src/routeTree.gen.ts` location. If you used a custom location, then you'll need to import your route tree from that location.

```tsx
import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";
```

### Code-Based Route Tree

If you used code-based routing, then you likely created your route tree manually using the root route's `addChildren` method:

```tsx
const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([
  // ...
]);
```

## Router Type Safety

> [!IMPORTANT]
> DO NOT SKIP THIS SECTION! ⚠️

TanStack Router provides amazing support for TypeScript, even for things you wouldn't expect like bare imports straight from the library! To make this possible, you must register your router's types using TypeScripts' [Declaration Merging](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html) feature. This is done by extending the `Register` interface on `@tanstack/react-router` with a `router` property that has the type of your `router` instance:

```tsx
declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
  interface Register {
    // This infers the type of our router and registers it across your entire project
    router: typeof router;
  }
}
```

With your router registered, you'll now get type-safety across your entire project for anything related to routing.

## 404 Not Found Route

As promised in earlier guides, we'll now cover the `notFoundRoute` option. This option is used to configure a route that will render when no other suitable match is found. This is useful for rendering a 404 page or redirecting to a default route.

If you are using either file-based or code-based routing, then you'll need to add a `notFoundComponent` key to `createRootRoute`:

```tsx
export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    // ...
  ),
  notFoundComponent: () => <div>404 Not Found</div>,
});
```

## Other Options

There are many other options that can be passed to the `Router` constructor. You can find a full list of them in the [API Reference](../../api/router/RouterOptionsType.md).
</file>

<file path="docs/react/guide/custom-link.md">
---
title: Custom Link
---

While repeating yourself can be acceptable in many situations, you might find that you do it too often. At times, you may want to create cross-cutting components with additional behavior or styles. You might also consider using third-party libraries in combination with TanStack Router's type safety.

## `createLink` for cross-cutting concerns

`createLink` creates a custom `Link` component with the same type parameters as `Link`. This means you can create your own component which provides the same type safety and typescript performance as `Link`.

### Basic example

If you want to create a basic custom link component, you can do so with the following:

[//]: # "BasicExampleImplementation"

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { createLink, LinkComponent } from "@tanstack/react-router";

interface BasicLinkProps extends React.AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement> {
  // Add any additional props you want to pass to the anchor element
}

const BasicLinkComponent = React.forwardRef<HTMLAnchorElement, BasicLinkProps>(
  (props, ref) => {
    return <a ref={ref} {...props} className={"block px-3 py-2 text-blue-700"} />;
  },
);

const CreatedLinkComponent = createLink(BasicLinkComponent);

export const CustomLink: LinkComponent<typeof BasicLinkComponent> = (props) => {
  return <CreatedLinkComponent preload={"intent"} {...props} />;
};
```

[//]: # "BasicExampleImplementation"

You can then use your newly created `Link` component as any other `Link`

```tsx
<CustomLink to={"/dashboard/invoices/$invoiceId"} params={{ invoiceId: 0 }} />
```

[//]: # "ExamplesUsingThirdPartyLibs"

## `createLink` with third party libraries

Here are some examples of how you can use `createLink` with third-party libraries.

### React Aria Components example

React Aria Components v1.11.0 and later works with TanStack Router's `preload (intent)` prop. Use `createLink` to wrap each React Aria component that you use as a link.

```tsx
import { createLink } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { Link as RACLink, MenuItem } from "react-aria-components";

export const Link = createLink(RACLink);
export const MenuItemLink = createLink(MenuItem);
```

To use React Aria's render props, including the `className`, `style`, and `children` functions, create a wrapper component and pass that to `createLink`.

```tsx
import { createLink } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { Link as RACLink, type LinkProps } from "react-aria-components";

interface MyLinkProps extends LinkProps {
  // your props
}

function MyLink(props: MyLinkProps) {
  return (
    <RACLink
      {...props}
      style={({ isHovered }) => ({
        color: isHovered ? "red" : "blue",
      })}
    />
  );
}

export const Link = createLink(MyLink);
```

### Chakra UI example

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { createLink, LinkComponent } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { Link } from "@chakra-ui/react";

interface ChakraLinkProps
  extends Omit<React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof Link>, "href"> {
  // Add any additional props you want to pass to the link
}

const ChakraLinkComponent = React.forwardRef<HTMLAnchorElement, ChakraLinkProps>(
  (props, ref) => {
    return <Link ref={ref} {...props} />;
  },
);

const CreatedLinkComponent = createLink(ChakraLinkComponent);

export const CustomLink: LinkComponent<typeof ChakraLinkComponent> = (props) => {
  return (
    <CreatedLinkComponent
      textDecoration={"underline"}
      _hover={{ textDecoration: "none" }}
      _focus={{ textDecoration: "none" }}
      preload={"intent"}
      {...props}
    />
  );
};
```

### MUI example

There is an [example](https://github.com/TanStack/router/tree/main/examples/react/start-material-ui) available which uses these patterns.

#### `Link`

If the MUI `Link` should simply behave like the router `Link`, it can be just wrapped with `createLink`:

```tsx
import { createLink } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { Link } from "@mui/material";

export const CustomLink = createLink(Link);
```

If the `Link` should be customized this approach can be used:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { createLink } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { Link } from "@mui/material";
import type { LinkProps } from "@mui/material";
import type { LinkComponent } from "@tanstack/react-router";

interface MUILinkProps extends LinkProps {
  // Add any additional props you want to pass to the Link
}

const MUILinkComponent = React.forwardRef<HTMLAnchorElement, MUILinkProps>(
  (props, ref) => <Link ref={ref} {...props} />,
);

const CreatedLinkComponent = createLink(MUILinkComponent);

export const CustomLink: LinkComponent<typeof MUILinkComponent> = (props) => {
  return <CreatedLinkComponent preload={"intent"} {...props} />;
};

// Can also be styled
```

#### `Button`

If a `Button` should be used as a router `Link`, the `component` should be set as `a`:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { createLink } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { Button } from "@mui/material";
import type { ButtonProps } from "@mui/material";
import type { LinkComponent } from "@tanstack/react-router";

interface MUIButtonLinkProps extends ButtonProps<"a"> {
  // Add any additional props you want to pass to the Button
}

const MUIButtonLinkComponent = React.forwardRef<HTMLAnchorElement, MUIButtonLinkProps>(
  (props, ref) => <Button ref={ref} component="a" {...props} />,
);

const CreatedButtonLinkComponent = createLink(MUIButtonLinkComponent);

export const CustomButtonLink: LinkComponent<typeof MUIButtonLinkComponent> = (props) => {
  return <CreatedButtonLinkComponent preload={"intent"} {...props} />;
};
```

#### Usage with `styled`

Any of these MUI approaches can then be used with `styled`:

```tsx
import { css, styled } from "@mui/material";
import { CustomLink } from "./CustomLink";

const StyledCustomLink = styled(CustomLink)(
  ({ theme }) => css`
    color: ${theme.palette.common.white};
  `,
);
```

### Mantine example

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { createLink, LinkComponent } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { Anchor, AnchorProps } from "@mantine/core";

interface MantineAnchorProps extends Omit<AnchorProps, "href"> {
  // Add any additional props you want to pass to the anchor
}

const MantineLinkComponent = React.forwardRef<HTMLAnchorElement, MantineAnchorProps>(
  (props, ref) => {
    return <Anchor ref={ref} {...props} />;
  },
);

const CreatedLinkComponent = createLink(MantineLinkComponent);

export const CustomLink: LinkComponent<typeof MantineLinkComponent> = (props) => {
  return <CreatedLinkComponent preload="intent" {...props} />;
};
```

<file path="docs/react/guide/custom-search-param-serialization.md">
---
title: Custom Search Param Serialization
---

By default, TanStack Router parses and serializes your URL Search Params automatically using `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`. This process involves escaping and unescaping the search string, which is a common practice for URL search params, in addition to the serialization and deserialization of the search object.

For instance, using the default configuration, if you have the following search object:

```tsx
const search = {
  page: 1,
  sort: "asc",
  filters: { author: "tanner", min_words: 800 },
};
```

It would be serialized and escaped into the following search string:

```txt
?page=1&sort=asc&filters=%7B%22author%22%3A%22tanner%22%2C%22min_words%22%3A800%7D
```

We can implement the default behavior with the following code:

```tsx
import {
  createRouter,
  parseSearchWith,
  stringifySearchWith,
} from "@tanstack/react-router";

const router = createRouter({
  // ...
  parseSearch: parseSearchWith(JSON.parse),
  stringifySearch: stringifySearchWith(JSON.stringify),
});
```

However, this default behavior may not be suitable for all use cases. For example, you may want to use a different serialization format, such as base64 encoding, or you may want to use a purpose-built serialization/deserialization library, like [query-string](https://github.com/sindresorhus/query-string), [JSURL2](https://github.com/wmertens/jsurl2), or [Zipson](https://jgranstrom.github.io/zipson/).

This can be achieved by providing your own serialization and deserialization functions to the `parseSearch` and `stringifySearch` options in the [`Router`](../../api/router/RouterOptionsType.md#stringifysearch-method) configuration. When doing this, you can utilize TanStack Router's built-in helper functions, `parseSearchWith` and `stringifySearchWith`, to simplify the process.

> [!TIP]
> An important aspect of serialization and deserialization, is that you are able to get the same object back after deserialization. This is important because if the serialization and deserialization process is not done correctly, you may lose some information. For example, if you are using a library that does not support nested objects, you may lose the nested object when deserializing the search string.

![Diagram showing idempotent nature of URL search param serialization and deserialization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TanStack/router/main/docs/router/assets/search-serialization-deserialization-idempotency.jpg)

Here are some examples of how you can customize the search param serialization in TanStack Router:

## Using Base64

It's common to base64 encode your search params to achieve maximum compatibility across browsers and URL unfurlers, etc. This can be done with the following code:

```tsx
import { Router, parseSearchWith, stringifySearchWith } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const router = createRouter({
  parseSearch: parseSearchWith((value) => JSON.parse(decodeFromBinary(value))),
  stringifySearch: stringifySearchWith((value) => encodeToBinary(JSON.stringify(value))),
});

function decodeFromBinary(str: string): string {
  return decodeURIComponent(
    Array.prototype.map
      .call(atob(str), function (c) {
        return "%" + ("00" + c.charCodeAt(0).toString(16)).slice(-2);
      })
      .join(""),
  );
}

function encodeToBinary(str: string): string {
  return btoa(
    encodeURIComponent(str).replace(/%([0-9A-F]{2})/g, function (match, p1) {
      return String.fromCharCode(parseInt(p1, 16));
    }),
  );
}
```

> [⚠️ Why does this snippet not use atob/btoa?](#safe-binary-encodingdecoding)

So, if we were to turn the previous object into a search string using this configuration, it would look like this:

```txt
?page=1&sort=asc&filters=eyJhdXRob3IiOiJ0YW5uZXIiLCJtaW5fd29yZHMiOjgwMH0%3D
```

> [!WARNING]
> If you are serializing user input into Base64, you run the risk of causing a collision with the URL deserialization. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the URL not being parsed correctly or being interpreted as a different value. To avoid this, you should encode the search params using a safe binary encoding/decoding method (see below).

## Using the query-string library

The [query-string](https://github.com/sindresorhus/query-string) library is a popular for being able to reliably parse and stringify query strings. You can use it to customize the serialization format of your search params. This can be done with the following code:

```tsx
import { createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import qs from "query-string";

const router = createRouter({
  // ...
  stringifySearch: stringifySearchWith((value) =>
    qs.stringify(value, {
      // ...options
    }),
  ),
  parseSearch: parseSearchWith((value) =>
    qs.parse(value, {
      // ...options
    }),
  ),
});
```

So, if we were to turn the previous object into a search string using this configuration, it would look like this:

```txt
?page=1&sort=asc&filters=author%3Dtanner%26min_words%3D800
```

## Using the JSURL2 library

[JSURL2](https://github.com/wmertens/jsurl2) is a non-standard library that can compress URLs while still maintaining readability. This can be done with the following code:

```tsx
import { Router, parseSearchWith, stringifySearchWith } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { parse, stringify } from "jsurl2";

const router = createRouter({
  // ...
  parseSearch: parseSearchWith(parse),
  stringifySearch: stringifySearchWith(stringify),
});
```

So, if we were to turn the previous object into a search string using this configuration, it would look like this:

```txt
?page=1&sort=asc&filters=(author~tanner~min*_words~800)~
```

## Using the Zipson library

[Zipson](https://jgranstrom.github.io/zipson/) is a very user-friendly and performant JSON compression library (both in runtime performance and the resulting compression performance). To compress your search params with it (which requires escaping/unescaping and base64 encoding/decoding them as well), you can use the following code:

```tsx
import { Router, parseSearchWith, stringifySearchWith } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { stringify, parse } from "zipson";

const router = createRouter({
  parseSearch: parseSearchWith((value) => parse(decodeFromBinary(value))),
  stringifySearch: stringifySearchWith((value) => encodeToBinary(stringify(value))),
});

function decodeFromBinary(str: string): string {
  return decodeURIComponent(
    Array.prototype.map
      .call(atob(str), function (c) {
        return "%" + ("00" + c.charCodeAt(0).toString(16)).slice(-2);
      })
      .join(""),
  );
}

function encodeToBinary(str: string): string {
  return btoa(
    encodeURIComponent(str).replace(/%([0-9A-F]{2})/g, function (match, p1) {
      return String.fromCharCode(parseInt(p1, 16));
    }),
  );
}
```

> [⚠️ Why does this snippet not use atob/btoa?](#safe-binary-encodingdecoding)

So, if we were to turn the previous object into a search string using this configuration, it would look like this:

```txt
?page=1&sort=asc&filters=JTdCJUMyJUE4YXV0aG9yJUMyJUE4JUMyJUE4dGFubmVyJUMyJUE4JUMyJUE4bWluX3dvcmRzJUMyJUE4JUMyJUEyQ3UlN0Q%3D
```

<hr>

### Safe Binary Encoding/Decoding

In the browser, the `atob` and `btoa` functions are not guaranteed to work properly with non-UTF8 characters. We recommend using these encoding/decoding utilities instead:

To encode from a string to a binary string:

```typescript
export function encodeToBinary(str: string): string {
  return btoa(
    encodeURIComponent(str).replace(/%([0-9A-F]{2})/g, function (match, p1) {
      return String.fromCharCode(parseInt(p1, 16));
    }),
  );
}
```

To decode from a binary string to a string:

```typescript
export function decodeFromBinary(str: string): string {
  return decodeURIComponent(
    Array.prototype.map
      .call(atob(str), function (c) {
        return "%" + ("00" + c.charCodeAt(0).toString(16)).slice(-2);
      })
      .join(""),
  );
}
```

id: data-loading
title: Data Loading
---

Data loading is a common concern for web applications and is related to routing. When loading a page for your app, it's ideal if all of the page's async requirements are fetched and fulfilled as early as possible, in parallel. The router is the best place to coordinate these async dependencies as it's usually the only place in your app that knows where users are headed before content is rendered.

You may be familiar with `getServerSideProps` from Next.js or `loader`s from Remix/React-Router. TanStack Router has similar functionality to preload/load assets on a per-route basis in parallel allowing it to render as quickly as possible as it fetches via suspense.

Beyond these normal expectations of a router, TanStack Router goes above and beyond and provides **built-in SWR Caching**, a long-term in-memory caching layer for route loaders. This means that you can use TanStack Router to both preload data for your routes so they load instantaneously or temporarily cache route data for previously visited routes to use again later.

## The route loading lifecycle

Every time a URL/history update is detected, the router executes the following sequence:

- Route Matching (Top-Down)
  - `route.params.parse`
  - `route.validateSearch`
- Route Pre-Loading (Serial)
  - `route.beforeLoad`
  - `route.onError`
    - `route.errorComponent` / `parentRoute.errorComponent` / `router.defaultErrorComponent`
- Route Loading (Parallel)
  - `route.component.preload?`
  - `route.loader`
    - `route.pendingComponent` (Optional)
    - `route.component`
  - `route.onError`
    - `route.errorComponent` / `parentRoute.errorComponent` / `router.defaultErrorComponent`

## To Router Cache or not to Router Cache?

There is a high possibility that TanStack's router cache will be a good fit for most smaller to medium size applications, but it's important to understand the tradeoffs of using it vs a more robust caching solution like TanStack Query:

TanStack Router Cache Pros:

- Built-in, easy to use, no extra dependencies
- Handles deduping, preloading, loading, stale-while-revalidate, background refetching on a per-route basis
- Coarse invalidation (invalidate all routes and cache at once)
- Automatic garbage collection
- Works great for apps that share little data between routes
- "Just works" for SSR

TanStack Router Cache Cons:

- No persistence adapters/model
- No shared caching/deduping between routes
- No built-in mutation APIs (a basic `useMutation` hook is provided in many examples that may be sufficient for many use cases)
- No built-in cache-level optimistic update APIs (you can still use ephemeral state from something like a `useMutation` hook to achieve this at the component level)

## Using the Router Cache

The router cache is built-in and is as easy as returning data from any route's `loader` function. Let's learn how!

## Route `loader`s

Route `loader` functions are called when a route match is loaded. They are called with a single parameter which is an object containing many helpful properties. We'll go over those in a bit, but first, let's look at an example of a route `loader` function:

```tsx
// routes/posts.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  loader: () => fetchPosts(),
});
```

## `loader` Parameters

The `loader` function receives a single object with the following properties:

- `abortController` - The route's abortController. Its signal is cancelled when the route is unloaded or when the Route is no longer relevant and the current invocation of the `loader` function becomes outdated.
- `cause` - The cause of the current route match. Can be either one of the following:
  - `enter` - When the route is matched and loaded after not being matched in the previous location.
  - `preload` - When the route is being preloaded.
  - `stay` - When the route is matched and loaded after being matched in the previous location.
- `context` - The route's context object, which is a merged union of:
  - Parent route context
  - This route's context as provided by the `beforeLoad` option
- `deps` - The object value returned from the `Route.loaderDeps` function. If `Route.loaderDeps` is not defined, an empty object will be provided instead.
- `location` - The current location
- `params` - The route's path params
- `parentMatchPromise` - `Promise<RouteMatch>` (`undefined` for the root route)
- `preload` - Boolean which is `true` when the route is being preloaded instead of loaded
- `route` - The route itself

Using these parameters, we can do a lot of cool things, but first, let's take a look at how we can control it and when the `loader` function is called.

## Consuming data from `loader`s

To consume data from a `loader`, use the `useLoaderData` hook defined on your Route object.

```tsx
const posts = Route.useLoaderData();
```

If you don't have ready access to your route object (i.e. you're deep in the component tree for the current route), you can use `getRouteApi` to access the same hook (as well as the other hooks on the Route object). This should be preferred over importing the Route object, which is likely to create circular dependencies.

```tsx
import { getRouteApi } from "@tanstack/react-router";

// in your component

const routeApi = getRouteApi("/posts");
const data = routeApi.useLoaderData();
```

## Dependency-based Stale-While-Revalidate Caching

TanStack Router provides a built-in Stale-While-Revalidate caching layer for route loaders that is keyed on the dependencies of a route:

- The route's fully parsed pathname
  - e.g. `/posts/1` vs `/posts/2`
- Any additional dependencies provided by the `loaderDeps` option
  - e.g. `loaderDeps: ({ search: { pageIndex, pageSize } }) => ({ pageIndex, pageSize })`

Using these dependencies as keys, TanStack Router will cache the data returned from a route's `loader` function and use it to fulfill subsequent requests for the same route match. This means that if a route's data is already in the cache, it will be returned immediately, then **potentially** be refetched in the background depending on the "freshness" of the data.

### Key options

To control router dependencies and "freshness", TanStack Router provides a plethora of options to control the keying and caching behavior of your route loaders. Let's take a look at them in the order that you are most likely to use them:

- `routeOptions.loaderDeps`
  - A function that supplies you the search params for a router and returns an object of dependencies for use in your `loader` function. When these deps changed from navigation to navigation, it will cause the route to reload regardless of `staleTime`s. The deps are compared using a deep equality check.
- `routeOptions.staleTime`
- `routerOptions.defaultStaleTime`
  - The number of milliseconds that a route's data should be considered fresh when attempting to load.
- `routeOptions.preloadStaleTime`
- `routerOptions.defaultPreloadStaleTime`
  - The number of milliseconds that a route's data should be considered fresh attempting to preload.
- `routeOptions.gcTime`
- `routerOptions.defaultGcTime`
  - The number of milliseconds that a route's data should be kept in the cache before being garbage collected.
- `routeOptions.shouldReload`
  - A function that receives the same `beforeLoad` and `loaderContext` parameters and returns a boolean indicating if the route should reload. This offers one more level of control over when a route should reload beyond `staleTime` and `loaderDeps` and can be used to implement patterns similar to Remix's `shouldLoad` option.

### ⚠️ Some Important Defaults

- By default, the `staleTime` is set to `0`, meaning that the route's data will always be considered stale and will always be reloaded in the background when the route is rematched.
- By default, a previously preloaded route is considered fresh for **30 seconds**. This means if a route is preloaded, then preloaded again within 30 seconds, the second preload will be ignored. This prevents unnecessary preloads from happening too frequently. **When a route is loaded normally, the standard `staleTime` is used.**
- By default, the `gcTime` is set to **30 minutes**, meaning that any route data that has not been accessed in 30 minutes will be garbage collected and removed from the cache.
- `router.invalidate()` will force all active routes to reload their loaders immediately and mark every cached route's data as stale.

### Using `loaderDeps` to access search params

Imagine a `/posts` route supports some pagination via search params `offset` and `limit`. For the cache to uniquely store this data, we need to access these search params via the `loaderDeps` function. By explicitly identifying them, each route match for `/posts` with different `offset` and `limit` won't get mixed up!

Once we have these deps in place, the route will always reload when the deps change.

```tsx
// /routes/posts.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  loaderDeps: ({ search: { offset, limit } }) => ({ offset, limit }),
  loader: ({ deps: { offset, limit } }) =>
    fetchPosts({
      offset,
      limit,
    }),
});
```

### Using `staleTime` to control how long data is considered fresh

By default, `staleTime` for navigations is set to `0`ms (and 30 seconds for preloads) which means that the route's data will always be considered stale and will always be reloaded in the background when the route is matched and navigated to.

**This is a good default for most use cases, but you may find that some route data is more static or potentially expensive to load.** In these cases, you can use the `staleTime` option to control how long the route's data is considered fresh for navigations. Let's take a look at an example:

```tsx
// /routes/posts.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  loader: () => fetchPosts(),
  // Consider the route's data fresh for 10 seconds
  staleTime: 10_000,
});
```

By passing `10_000` to the `staleTime` option, we are telling the router to consider the route's data fresh for 10 seconds. This means that if the user navigates to `/posts` from `/about` within 10 seconds of the last loader result, the route's data will not be reloaded. If the user then navigates to `/posts` from `/about` after 10 seconds, the route's data will be reloaded **in the background**.

## Turning off stale-while-revalidate caching

To disable stale-while-revalidate caching for a route, set the `staleTime` option to `Infinity`:

```tsx
// /routes/posts.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  loader: () => fetchPosts(),
  staleTime: Infinity,
});
```

You can even turn this off for all routes by setting the `defaultStaleTime` option on the router:

```tsx
const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
  defaultStaleTime: Infinity,
});
```

## Using `shouldReload` and `gcTime` to opt-out of caching

Similar to Remix's default functionality, you may want to configure a route to only load on entry or when critical loader deps change. You can do this by using the `gcTime` option combined with the `shouldReload` option, which accepts either a `boolean` or a function that receives the same `beforeLoad` and `loaderContext` parameters and returns a boolean indicating if the route should reload.

```tsx
// /routes/posts.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  loaderDeps: ({ search: { offset, limit } }) => ({ offset, limit }),
  loader: ({ deps }) => fetchPosts(deps),
  // Do not cache this route's data after it's unloaded
  gcTime: 0,
  // Only reload the route when the user navigates to it or when deps change
  shouldReload: false,
});
```

### Opting out of caching while still preloading

Even though you may opt-out of short-term caching for your route data, you can still get the benefits of preloading! With the above configuration, preloading will still "just work" with the default `preloadGcTime`. This means that if a route is preloaded, then navigated to, the route's data will be considered fresh and will not be reloaded.

To opt out of preloading, don't turn it on via the `routerOptions.defaultPreload` or `routeOptions.preload` options.

## Passing all loader events to an external cache

We break down this use case in the [External Data Loading](../external-data-loading.md) page, but if you'd like to use an external cache like TanStack Query, you can do so by passing all loader events to your external cache. As long as you are using the defaults, the only change you'll need to make is to set the `defaultPreloadStaleTime` option on the router to `0`:

```tsx
const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
  defaultPreloadStaleTime: 0,
});
```

This will ensure that every preload, load, and reload event will trigger your `loader` functions, which can then be handled and deduped by your external cache.

## Using Router Context

The `context` argument passed to the `loader` function is an object containing a merged union of:

- Parent route context
- This route's context as provided by the `beforeLoad` option

Starting at the very top of the router, you can pass an initial context to the router via the `context` option. This context will be available to all routes in the router and get copied and extended by each route as they are matched. This happens by passing a context to a route via the `beforeLoad` option. This context will be available to all the route's child routes. The resulting context will be available to the route's `loader` function.

In this example, we'll create a function in our route context to fetch posts, then use it in our `loader` function.

> 🧠 Context is a powerful tool for dependency injection. You can use it to inject services, hooks, and other objects into your router and routes. You can also additively pass data down the route tree at every route using a route's `beforeLoad` option.

- `/utils/fetchPosts.tsx`

```tsx
export const fetchPosts = async () => {
  const res = await fetch(`/api/posts?page=${pageIndex}`);
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error("Failed to fetch posts");
  return res.json();
};
```

- `/routes/__root.tsx`

```tsx
import { createRootRouteWithContext } from "@tanstack/react-router";

// Create a root route using the createRootRouteWithContext<{...}>() function and pass it whatever types you would like to be available in your router context.
export const Route = createRootRouteWithContext<{
  fetchPosts: typeof fetchPosts;
}>()(); // NOTE: the double call is on purpose, since createRootRouteWithContext is a factory ;)
```

- `/routes/posts.tsx`

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

// Notice how our postsRoute references context to get our fetchPosts function
// This can be a powerful tool for dependency injection across your router
// and routes.
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  loader: ({ context: { fetchPosts } }) => fetchPosts(),
});
```

- `/router.tsx`

```tsx
import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

// Use your routerContext to create a new router
// This will require that you fullfil the type requirements of the routerContext
const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
  context: {
    // Supply the fetchPosts function to the router context
    fetchPosts,
  },
});
```

## Using Path Params

To use path params in your `loader` function, access them via the `params` property on the function's parameters. Here's an example:

```tsx
// routes/posts.$postId.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  loader: ({ params: { postId } }) => fetchPostById(postId),
});
```

## Using Route Context

Passing down global context to your router is great, but what if you want to provide context that is specific to a route? This is where the `beforeLoad` option comes in. The `beforeLoad` option is a function that runs right before attempting to load a route and receives the same parameters as `loader`. Beyond its ability to redirect potential matches, block loader requests, etc, it can also return an object that will be merged into the route's context. Let's take a look at an example where we inject some data into our route context via the `beforeLoad` option:

```tsx
// /routes/posts.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  // Pass the fetchPosts function to the route context
  beforeLoad: () => ({
    fetchPosts: () => console.info("foo"),
  }),
  loader: ({ context: { fetchPosts } }) => {
    console.info(fetchPosts()); // 'foo'

    // ...
  },
});
```

## Using Search Params in Loaders

> ❓ But wait Tanner... where the heck are my search params?!

You might be here wondering why `search` isn't directly available in the `loader` function's parameters. We've purposefully designed it this way to help you succeed. Let's take a look at why:

- Search Parameters being used in a loader function are a very good indicator that those search params should also be used to uniquely identify the data being loaded. For example, you may have a route that uses a search param like `pageIndex` that uniquely identifies the data held inside of the route match. Or, imagine a `/users/user` route that uses the search param `userId` to identify a specific user in your application, you might model your url like this: `/users/user?userId=123`. This means that your `user` route would need some extra help to identify a specific user.
- Directly accessing search params in a loader function can lead to bugs in caching and preloading where the data being loaded is not unique to the current URL pathname and search params. For example, you might ask your `/posts` route to preload page 2's results, but without the distinction of pages in your route configuration, you will end up fetching, storing and displaying page 2's data on your `/posts` or `?page=1` screen instead of it preloading in the background!
- Placing a threshold between search parameters and the loader function allows the router to understand your dependencies and reactivity.

```tsx
// /routes/users.user.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/users/user")({
  validateSearch: (search) =>
    search as {
      userId: string;
    },
  loaderDeps: ({ search: { userId } }) => ({
    userId,
  }),
  loader: async ({ deps: { userId } }) => getUser(userId),
});
```

### Accessing Search Params via `routeOptions.loaderDeps`

```tsx
// /routes/posts.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  // Use zod to validate and parse the search params
  validateSearch: z.object({
    offset: z.number().int().nonnegative().catch(0),
  }),
  // Pass the offset to your loader deps via the loaderDeps function
  loaderDeps: ({ search: { offset } }) => ({ offset }),
  // Use the offset from context in the loader function
  loader: async ({ deps: { offset } }) =>
    fetchPosts({
      offset,
    }),
});
```

## Using the Abort Signal

The `abortController` property of the `loader` function is an [AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController). Its signal is cancelled when the route is unloaded or when the `loader` call becomes outdated. This is useful for cancelling network requests when the route is unloaded or when the route's params change. Here is an example using it with a fetch call:

```tsx
// routes/posts.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  loader: ({ abortController }) =>
    fetchPosts({
      // Pass this to an underlying fetch call or anything that supports signals
      signal: abortController.signal,
    }),
});
```

## Using the `preload` flag

The `preload` property of the `loader` function is a boolean which is `true` when the route is being preloaded instead of loaded. Some data loading libraries may handle preloading differently than a standard fetch, so you may want to pass `preload` to your data loading library, or use it to execute the appropriate data loading logic:

```tsx
// routes/posts.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  loader: async ({ preload }) =>
    fetchPosts({
      maxAge: preload ? 10_000 : 0, // Preloads should hang around a bit longer
    }),
});
```

## Handling Slow Loaders

Ideally most route loaders can resolve their data within a short moment, removing the need to render a placeholder spinner and simply rely on suspense to render the next route when it's completely ready. When critical data that is required to render a route's component is slow though, you have 2 options:

- Split up your fast and slow data into separate promises and `defer` the slow data until after the fast data is loaded (see the [Deferred Data Loading](../deferred-data-loading.md) guide).
- Show a pending component after an optimistic suspense threshold until all of the data is ready (See below).

## Showing a pending component

**By default, TanStack Router will show a pending component for loaders that take longer than 1 second to resolve.** This is an optimistic threshold that can be configured via:

- `routeOptions.pendingMs` or
- `routerOptions.defaultPendingMs`

When the pending time threshold is exceeded, the router will render the `pendingComponent` option of the route, if configured.

## Avoiding Pending Component Flash

If you're using a pending component, the last thing you want is for your pending time threshold to be met, then have your data resolve immediately after, resulting in a jarring flash of your pending component. To avoid this, **TanStack Router by default will show your pending component for at least 500ms**. This is an optimistic threshold that can be configured via:

- `routeOptions.pendingMinMs` or
- `routerOptions.defaultPendingMinMs`

## Handling Errors

TanStack Router provides a few ways to handle errors that occur during the route loading lifecycle. Let's take a look at them.

### Handling Errors with `routeOptions.onError`

The `routeOptions.onError` option is a function that is called when an error occurs during the route loading.

```tsx
// routes/posts.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  loader: () => fetchPosts(),
  onError: ({ error }) => {
    // Log the error
    console.error(error);
  },
});
```

### Handling Errors with `routeOptions.onCatch`

The `routeOptions.onCatch` option is a function that is called whenever an error was caught by the router's CatchBoundary.

```tsx
// routes/posts.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  onCatch: ({ error, errorInfo }) => {
    // Log the error
    console.error(error);
  },
});
```

### Handling Errors with `routeOptions.errorComponent`

The `routeOptions.errorComponent` option is a component that is rendered when an error occurs during the route loading or rendering lifecycle. It is rendered with the following props:

- `error` - The error that occurred
- `reset` - A function to reset the internal `CatchBoundary`

```tsx
// routes/posts.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  loader: () => fetchPosts(),
  errorComponent: ({ error }) => {
    // Render an error message
    return <div>{error.message}</div>;
  },
});
```

The `reset` function can be used to allow the user to retry rendering the error boundaries normal children:

```tsx
// routes/posts.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  loader: () => fetchPosts(),
  errorComponent: ({ error, reset }) => {
    return (
      <div>
        {error.message}
        <button
          onClick={() => {
            // Reset the router error boundary
            reset();
          }}
        >
          retry
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  },
});
```

If the error was the result of a route load, you should instead call `router.invalidate()`, which will coordinate both a router reload and an error boundary reset:

```tsx
// routes/posts.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  loader: () => fetchPosts(),
  errorComponent: ({ error, reset }) => {
    const router = useRouter();

    return (
      <div>
        {error.message}
        <button
          onClick={() => {
            // Invalidate the route to reload the loader, which will also reset the error boundary
            router.invalidate();
          }}
        >
          retry
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  },
});
```

### Using the default `ErrorComponent`

TanStack Router provides a default `ErrorComponent` that is rendered when an error occurs during the route loading or rendering lifecycle. If you choose to override your routes' error components, it's still wise to always fall back to rendering any uncaught errors with the default `ErrorComponent`:

```tsx
// routes/posts.tsx
import { createFileRoute, ErrorComponent } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  loader: () => fetchPosts(),
  errorComponent: ({ error }) => {
    if (error instanceof MyCustomError) {
      // Render a custom error message
      return <div>{error.message}</div>;
    }

    // Fallback to the default ErrorComponent
    return <ErrorComponent error={error} />;
  },
});
```
</file>

title: Data Mutations
---

Since TanStack router does not store or cache data, it's role in data mutation is slim to none outside of reacting to potential URL side-effects from external mutation events. That said, we've compiled a list of mutation-related features you might find useful and libraries that implement them.

Look for and use mutation utilities that support:

- Handling and caching submission state
- Providing both local and global optimistic UI support
- Built-in hooks to wire up invalidation (or automatically support it)
- Handling multiple in-flight mutations at once
- Organizing mutation state as a globally accessible resource
- Submission state history and garbage collection

Some suggested libraries:

- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/mutations)
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/)
- [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview)
- [urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/)
- [Relay](https://relay.dev/)
- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)

Or, even...

- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/)
- [Jotai](https://jotai.org/)
- [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

Similar to data fetching, mutation state isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, so you'll need to pick a solution that fits your needs and your team's needs. We recommend trying out a few different solutions and seeing what works best for you.

> ⚠️ Still here? Submission state is an interesting topic when it comes to persistence. Do you keep every mutation around forever? How do you know when to get rid of it? What if the user navigates away from the screen and then back? Let's dig in!

## Invalidating TanStack Router after a mutation

TanStack Router comes with short-term caching built-in. So even though we're not storing any data after a route match is unmounted, there is a high probability that if any mutations are made related to the data stored in the Router, the current route matches' data could become stale.

When mutations related to loader data are made, we can use `router.invalidate` to force the router to reload all of the current route matches:

```tsx
const router = useRouter();

const addTodo = async (todo: Todo) => {
  try {
    await api.addTodo();
    router.invalidate();
  } catch {
    //
  }
};
```

Invalidating all of the current route matches happens in the background, so existing data will continue to be served until the new data is ready, just as if you were navigating to a new route.

If you want to await the invalidation until all loaders have finished, pass `{sync: true}` into `router.invalidate`:

```tsx
const router = useRouter();

const addTodo = async (todo: Todo) => {
  try {
    await api.addTodo();
    await router.invalidate({ sync: true });
  } catch {
    //
  }
};
```

## Long-term mutation State

Regardless of the mutation library used, mutations often create state related to their submission. While most mutations are set-and-forget, some mutation states are more long-lived, either to support optimistic UI or to provide feedback to the user about the status of their submissions. Most state managers will correctly keep this submission state around and expose it to make it possible to show UI elements like loading spinners, success messages, error messages, etc.

Let's consider the following interactions:

- User navigates to the `/posts/123/edit` screen to edit a post
- User edits the `123` post and upon success, sees a success message below the editor that the post was updated
- User navigates to the `/posts` screen
- User navigates back to the `/posts/123/edit` screen again

Without notifying your mutation management library about the route change, it's possible that your submission state could still be around and your user would still see the **"Post updated successfully"** message when they return to the previous screen. This is not ideal. Obviously, our intent wasn't to keep this mutation state around forever, right?!

## Using mutation keys

Hopefully and hypothetically, the easiest way is for your mutation library to support a keying mechanism that will allow your mutations's state to be reset when the key changes:

```tsx
const routeApi = getRouteApi("/room/$roomId/chat");

function ChatRoom() {
  const { roomId } = routeApi.useParams();

  const sendMessageMutation = useCoolMutation({
    fn: sendMessage,
    // Clear the mutation state when the roomId changes
    // including any submission state
    key: ["sendMessage", roomId],
  });

  // Fire off a bunch of messages
  const test = () => {
    sendMessageMutation.mutate({ roomId, message: "Hello!" });
    sendMessageMutation.mutate({ roomId, message: "How are you?" });
    sendMessageMutation.mutate({ roomId, message: "Goodbye!" });
  };

  return (
    <>
      {sendMessageMutation.submissions.map((submission) => {
        return (
          <div>
            <div>{submission.status}</div>
            <div>{submission.message}</div>
          </div>
        );
      })}
    </>
  );
}
```

## Using the `router.subscribe` method

For libraries that don't have a keying mechanism, we'll likely need to manually reset the mutation state when the user navigates away from the screen. To solve this, we can use TanStack Router's `invalidate` and `subscribe` method to clear mutation states when the user is no longer in need of them.

The `router.subscribe` method is a function that subscribes a callback to various router events. The event in particular that we'll use here is the `onResolved` event. It's important to understand that this event is fired when the location path is _changed (not just reloaded) and has finally resolved_.

This is a great place to reset your old mutation states. Here's an example:

```tsx

const coolMutationCache = createCoolMutationCache();

const unsubscribeFn = router.subscribe("onResolved", () => {

title: Deferred Data Loading
---

TanStack Router is designed to run loaders in parallel and wait for all of them to resolve before rendering the next route. This is great most of the time, but occasionally, you may want to show the user something sooner while the rest of the data loads in the background.

Deferred data loading is a pattern that allows the router to render the next location's critical data/markup while slower, non-critical route data is resolved in the background. This process works on both the client and server (via streaming) and is a great way to improve the perceived performance of your application.

If you are using a library like [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) or any other data fetching library, then deferred data loading works a bit differently. Skip ahead to the [Deferred Data Loading with External Libraries](#deferred-data-loading-with-external-libraries) section for more information.

## Deferred Data Loading with `Await`

To defer slow or non-critical data, return an **unawaited/unresolved** promise anywhere in your loader response:

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.$postId.tsx
import { createFileRoute, defer } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  loader: async () => {
    // Fetch some slower data, but do not await it
    const slowDataPromise = fetchSlowData();

    // Fetch and await some data that resolves quickly
    const fastData = await fetchFastData();

    return {
      fastData,
      deferredSlowData: slowDataPromise,
    };
  },
});
```

As soon as any awaited promises are resolved, the next route will begin rendering while the deferred promises continue to resolve.

In the component, deferred promises can be resolved and utilized using the `Await` component:

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.$postId.tsx
import { createFileRoute, Await } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  // ...
  component: PostIdComponent,
});

function PostIdComponent() {
  const { deferredSlowData, fastData } = Route.useLoaderData();

  // do something with fastData

  return (
    <Await promise={deferredSlowData} fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      {(data) => {
        return <div>{data}</div>;
      }}
    </Await>
  );
}
```

> [!TIP]
> If your component is code-split, you can use the [getRouteApi function](../code-splitting.md#manually-accessing-route-apis-in-other-files-with-the-getrouteapi-helper) to avoid having to import the `Route` configuration to get access to the typed `useLoaderData()` hook.

The `Await` component resolves the promise by triggering the nearest suspense boundary until it is resolved, after which it renders the component's `children` as a function with the resolved data.

If the promise is rejected, the `Await` component will throw the serialized error, which can be caught by the nearest error boundary.

> [!TIP]
> In React 19, you can use the `use()` hook instead of `Await`

[//]: # "DeferredWithAwaitFinalTip"

## Deferred Data Loading with External libraries

When your strategy for fetching information for the route relies on [External Data Loading](../external-data-loading.md) with an external library like [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query), deferred data loading works a bit differently, as the library handles the data fetching and caching for you outside of TanStack Router.

So, instead of using `defer` and `Await`, you'll instead want to use the Route's `loader` to kick off the data fetching and then use the library's hooks to access the data in your components.

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.$postId.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { slowDataOptions, fastDataOptions } from "~/api/query-options";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  loader: async ({ context: { queryClient } }) => {
    // Kick off the fetching of some slower data, but do not await it
    queryClient.prefetchQuery(slowDataOptions());

    // Fetch and await some data that resolves quickly
    await queryClient.ensureQueryData(fastDataOptions());
  },
});
```

Then in your component, you can use the library's hooks to access the data:

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.$postId.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { useSuspenseQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { slowDataOptions, fastDataOptions } from "~/api/query-options";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  // ...
  component: PostIdComponent,
});

function PostIdComponent() {
  const fastData = useSuspenseQuery(fastDataOptions());

  // do something with fastData

  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <SlowDataComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

function SlowDataComponent() {
  const data = useSuspenseQuery(slowDataOptions());

  return <div>{data}</div>;
}
```

## Caching and Invalidation

Streamed promises follow the same lifecycle as the loader data they are associated with. They can even be preloaded!

[//]: # "SSRContent"

## SSR & Streaming Deferred Data

**Streaming requires a server that supports it and for TanStack Router to be configured to use it properly.**

Please read the entire [Streaming SSR Guide](../ssr.md#streaming-ssr) for step by step instructions on how to set up your server for streaming.

## SSR Streaming Lifecycle

The following is a high-level overview of how deferred data streaming works with TanStack Router:

- Server
  - Promises are marked and tracked as they are returned from route loaders
  - All loaders resolve and any deferred promises are serialized and embedded into the html
  - The route begins to render
  - Deferred promises rendered with the `<Await>` component trigger suspense boundaries, allowing the server to stream html up to that point
- Client
  - The client receives the initial html from the server
  - `<Await>` components suspend with placeholder promises while they wait for their data to resolve on the server
- Server
  - As deferred promises resolve, their results (or errors) are serialized and streamed to the client via an inline script tag
  - The resolved `<Await>` components and their suspense boundaries are resolved and their resulting HTML is streamed to the client along with their dehydrated data
- Client
  - The suspended placeholder promises within `<Await>` are resolved with the streamed data/error responses and either render the result or throw the error to the nearest error boundary

<file path="docs/react/guide/document-head-management.md">

title: Document Head Management
---

Document head management is the process of managing the head, title, meta, link, and script tags of a document and TanStack Router provides a robust way to manage the document head for full-stack applications that use Start and for single-page applications that use `@tanstack/react-router`. It provides:

- Automatic deduping of `title` and `meta` tags
- Automatic loading/unloading of tags based on route visibility
- A composable way to merge `title` and `meta` tags from nested routes

For full-stack applications that use Start, and even for single-page applications that use `@tanstack/react-router`, managing the document head is a crucial part of any application for the following reasons:

- SEO
- Social media sharing
- Analytics
- CSS and JS loading/unloading

To manage the document head, it's required that you render both the `<HeadContent />` and `<Scripts />` components and use the `routeOptions.head` property to manage the head of a route, which returns an object with `title`, `meta`, `links`, `styles`, and `scripts` properties.

## Managing the Document Head

```tsx
export const Route = createRootRoute({
  head: () => ({
    meta: [
      {
        name: "description",
        content: "My App is a web application",
      },
      {
        title: "My App",
      },
    ],
    links: [
      {
        rel: "icon",
        href: "/favicon.ico",
      },
    ],
    styles: [
      {
        media: "all and (max-width: 500px)",
        children: `p {
                  color: blue;
                  background-color: yellow;
                }`,
      },
    ],
    scripts: [
      {
        src: "https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js",
      },
    ],
  }),
});
```

### Deduping

Out of the box, TanStack Router will dedupe `title` and `meta` tags, preferring the **last** occurrence of each tag found in nested routes.

- `title` tags defined in nested routes will override a `title` tag defined in a parent route (but you can compose them together, which is covered in a future section of this guide)
- `meta` tags with the same `name` or `property` will be overridden by the last occurrence of that tag found in nested routes

### `<HeadContent />`

The `<HeadContent />` component is **required** to render the head, title, meta, link, and head-related script tags of a document.

It should be **rendered either in the `<head>` tag of your root layout or as high up in the component tree as possible** if your application doesn't or can't manage the `<head>` tag.

### Start/Full-Stack Applications

```tsx
import { HeadContent } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <html>
      <head>
        <HeadContent />
      </head>
      <body>
        <Outlet />
      </body>
    </html>
  ),
});
```

### Single-Page Applications

First, remove the `<title>` tag from the the index.html if you have set any.

```tsx
import { HeadContent } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const rootRoute = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <HeadContent />
      <Outlet />
    </>
  ),
});
```

## Managing Body Scripts

In addition to scripts that can be rendered in the `<head>` tag, you can also render scripts in the `<body>` tag using the `routeOptions.scripts` property. This is useful for loading scripts (even inline scripts) that require the DOM to be loaded, but before the main entry point of your application (which includes hydration if you're using Start or a full-stack implementation of TanStack Router).

To do this, you must:

- Use the `scripts` property of the `routeOptions` object
- [Render the `<Scripts />` component](#scripts)

```tsx
export const Route = createRootRoute({
  scripts: () => [
    {
      children: 'console.log("Hello, world!")',
    },
  ],
});
```

### `<Scripts />`

The `<Scripts />` component is **required** to render the body scripts of a document. It should be rendered either in the `<body>` tag of your root layout or as high up in the component tree as possible if your application doesn't or can't manage the `<body>` tag.

### Example

```tsx
import { createFileRoute, Scripts } from "@tanstack/react-router";
export const Router = createFileRoute("/")({
  component: () => (
    <html>
      <head />
      <body>
        <Outlet />
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  ),
});
```

```tsx
import { Scripts, createRootRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <Outlet />
      <Scripts />
    </>
  ),
});
```

title: External Data Loading
---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide is geared towards external state management libraries and their integration with TanStack Router for data fetching, ssr, hydration/dehydration and streaming. If you haven't read the standard [Data Loading](../data-loading.md) guide, please do so first.

## To **Store** or to **Coordinate**?

While Router is very capable of storing and managing most data needs out of the box, sometimes you just might want something more robust!

Router is designed to be a perfect **coordinator** for external data fetching and caching libraries. This means that you can use any data fetching/caching library you want, and the router will coordinate the loading of your data in a way that aligns with your users' navigation and expectations of freshness.

## What data fetching libraries are supported?

Any data fetching library that supports asynchronous promises can be used with TanStack Router. This includes:

- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/overview)
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/)
- [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview)
- [urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/)
- [Relay](https://relay.dev/)
- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)

Or, even...

- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/)
- [Jotai](https://jotai.org/)
- [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

Literally any library that **can return a promise and read/write data** can be integrated.

## Using Loaders to ensure data is loaded

The easiest way to use integrate and external caching/data library into Router is to use `route.loader`s to ensure that the data required inside of a route has been loaded and is ready to be displayed.

> ⚠️ BUT WHY? It's very important to preload your critical render data in the loader for a few reasons:
>
> - No "flash of loading" states
> - No waterfall data fetching, caused by component based fetching
> - Better for SEO. If your data is available at render time, it will be indexed by search engines.

Here is a naive illustration (don't do this) of using a Route's `loader` option to seed the cache for some data:

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.tsx
let postsCache = [];

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  loader: async () => {
    postsCache = await fetchPosts();
  },
  component: () => {
    return (
      <div>
        {postsCache.map((post) => (
          <Post key={post.id} post={post} />
        ))}
      </div>
    );
  },
});
```

This example is **obviously flawed**, but illustrates the point that you can use a route's `loader` option to seed your cache with data. Let's take a look at a more realistic example using TanStack Query.

- Replace `fetchPosts` with your preferred data fetching library's prefetching API
- Replace `postsCache` with your preferred data fetching library's read-or-fetch API or hook

## A more realistic example using TanStack Query

Let's take a look at a more realistic example using TanStack Query.

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.tsx
const postsQueryOptions = queryOptions({
  queryKey: ["posts"],
  queryFn: () => fetchPosts(),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  // Use the `loader` option to ensure that the data is loaded
  loader: () => queryClient.ensureQueryData(postsQueryOptions),
  component: () => {
    // Read the data from the cache and subscribe to updates
    const {
      data: { posts },
    } = useSuspenseQuery(postsQueryOptions);

    return (
      <div>
        {posts.map((post) => (
          <Post key={post.id} post={post} />
        ))}
      </div>
    );
  },
});
```

### Error handling with TanStack Query

When an error occurs while using `suspense` with `TanStack Query`, you'll need to let queries know that you want to try again when re-rendering. This can be done by using the `reset` function provided by the `useQueryErrorResetBoundary` hook. We can invoke this function in an effect as soon as the error component mounts. This will make sure that the query is reset and will try to fetch data again when the route component is rendered again. This will also cover cases where users navigate away from our route instead of clicking the `retry` button.

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  loader: () => queryClient.ensureQueryData(postsQueryOptions),
  errorComponent: ({ error, reset }) => {
    const router = useRouter();
    const queryErrorResetBoundary = useQueryErrorResetBoundary();

    useEffect(() => {
      // Reset the query error boundary
      queryErrorResetBoundary.reset();
    }, [queryErrorResetBoundary]);

    return (
      <div>
        {error.message}
        <button
          onClick={() => {
            // Invalidate the route to reload the loader, and reset any router error boundaries
            router.invalidate();
          }}
        >
          retry
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  },
});
```

## SSR Dehydration/Hydration

Tools that are able can integrate with TanStack Router's convenient Dehydration/Hydration APIs to shuttle dehydrated data between the server and client and rehydrate it where needed. Let's go over how to do this with both 3rd party critical data and 3rd party deferred data.

## Critical Dehydration/Hydration

**For critical data needed for the first render/paint**, TanStack Router supports **`dehydrate` and `hydrate`** options when configuring the `Router`. These callbacks are functions that are automatically called on the server and client when the router dehydrates and hydrates normally and allow you to augment the dehydrated data with your own data.

The `dehydrate` function can return any serializable JSON data which will get merged and injected into the dehydrated payload that is sent to the client.

For example, let's dehydrate and hydrate a TanStack Query `QueryClient` so that our data we fetched on the server will be available for hydration on the client.

```tsx
// src/router.tsx

export function createRouter() {
  // Make sure you create your loader client or similar data
  // stores inside of your `createRouter` function. This ensures
  // that your data stores are unique to each request and
  // always present on both server and client.
  const queryClient = new QueryClient();

  return createRouter({
    routeTree,
    // Optionally provide your loaderClient to the router context for
    // convenience (you can provide anything you want to the router
    // context!)
    context: {
      queryClient,
    },
    // On the server, dehydrate the loader client so the router
    // can serialize it and send it to the client for us
    dehydrate: () => {
      return {
        queryClientState: dehydrate(queryClient),
      };
    },
    // On the client, hydrate the loader client with the data
    // we dehydrated on the server
    hydrate: (dehydrated) => {
      hydrate(queryClient, dehydrated.queryClientState);
    },
    // Optionally, we can use `Wrap` to wrap our router in the loader client provider
    Wrap: ({ children }) => {
      return <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>{children}</QueryClientProvider>;
    },
  });
}
```
</file>

<file path="docs/react/guide/history-types.md">
---
title: History Types
---

While it's not required to know the `@tanstack/history` API itself to use TanStack Router, it's a good idea to understand how it works. Under the hood, TanStack Router requires and uses a `history` abstraction to manage the routing history.

If you don't create a history instance, a browser-oriented instance of this API is created for you when the router is initialized. If you need a special history API type, You can use the `@tanstack/history` package to create your own:

- `createBrowserHistory`: The default history type.
- `createHashHistory`: A history type that uses a hash to track history.
- `createMemoryHistory`: A history type that keeps the history in memory.

Once you have a history instance, you can pass it to the `Router` constructor:

```ts
import { createMemoryHistory, createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const memoryHistory = createMemoryHistory({
  initialEntries: ["/"], // Pass your initial url
});

const router = createRouter({ routeTree, history: memoryHistory });
```

## Browser Routing

The `createBrowserHistory` is the default history type. It uses the browser's history API to manage the browser history.

## Hash Routing

Hash routing can be helpful if your server doesn't support rewrites to index.html for HTTP requests (among other environments that don't have a server).

```ts
import { createHashHistory, createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const hashHistory = createHashHistory();

const router = createRouter({ routeTree, history: hashHistory });
```

## Memory Routing

Memory routing is useful in environments that are not a browser or when you do not want components to interact with the URL.

```ts
import { createMemoryHistory, createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const memoryHistory = createMemoryHistory({
  initialEntries: ["/"], // Pass your initial url
});

const router = createRouter({ routeTree, history: memoryHistory });
```

Refer to the [SSR Guide](../ssr.md#server-history) for usage on the server for server-side rendering.

<file path="docs/react/guide/link-options.md">
---
title: Link Options
---

You may want to reuse options that are intended to be passed to `Link`, `redirect` or `navigate`. In which case you may decide an object literal is a good way to represent options passed to `Link`.

```tsx
const dashboardLinkOptions = {
  to: "/dashboard",
  search: { search: "" },
};

function DashboardComponent() {
  return <Link {...dashboardLinkOptions} />;
}
```

There are a few problems here. `dashboardLinkOptions.to` is inferred as `string` which by default will resolve to every route when passed to `Link`, `navigate` or `redirect` (this particular issue could be fixed by `as const`). The other issue here is we do not know `dashboardLinkOptions` even passes the type checker until it is spread into `Link`. We could very easily create incorrect navigation options and only when the options are spread into `Link` do we know there is a type error.

### Using `linkOptions` function to create re-usable options

`linkOptions` is a function which type checks an object literal and returns the inferred input as is. This provides type safety on options exactly like `Link` before it is used allowing for easier maintenance and re-usability. Our above example using `linkOptions` looks like this:

```tsx
const dashboardLinkOptions = linkOptions({
  to: "/dashboard",
  search: { search: "" },
});

function DashboardComponent() {
  return <Link {...dashboardLinkOptions} />;
}
```

This allows eager type checking of `dashboardLinkOptions` which can then be re-used anywhere

```tsx
const dashboardLinkOptions = linkOptions({
  to: "/dashboard",
  search: { search: "" },
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/dashboard")({
  component: DashboardComponent,
  validateSearch: (input) => ({ search: input.search }),
  beforeLoad: () => {
    // can used in redirect
    throw redirect(dashboardLinkOptions);
  },
});

function DashboardComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  return (
    <div>
      {/** can be used in navigate */}
      <button onClick={() => navigate(dashboardLinkOptions)} />

      {/** can be used in Link */}
      <Link {...dashboardLinkOptions} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### An array of `linkOptions`

When creating navigation you might loop over an array to construct a navigation bar. In which case `linkOptions` can be used to type check an array of object literals which are intended for `Link` props

```tsx
const options = linkOptions([
  {
    to: "/dashboard",
    label: "Summary",
    activeOptions: { exact: true },
  },
  {
    to: "/dashboard/invoices",
    label: "Invoices",
  },
  {
    to: "/dashboard/users",
    label: "Users",
  },
]);

function DashboardComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <div className="flex items-center border-b">
        <h2 className="p-2 text-xl">Dashboard</h2>
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-wrap divide-x">
        {options.map((option) => {
          return (
            <Link
              {...option}
              key={option.to}
              activeProps={{ className: `font-bold` }}
              className="p-2"
            >
              {option.label}
            </Link>
          );
        })}
      </div>
      <hr />

      <Outlet />
    </>
  );
}
```

The input of `linkOptions` is inferred and returned, as shown with the use of `label` as this does not exist on `Link` props
</file>

<file path="docs/react/guide/navigation-blocking.md">
---
title: Navigation Blocking
---

Navigation blocking is a way to prevent navigation from happening. This is typical if a user attempts to navigate while they:

- Have unsaved changes
- Are in the middle of a form
- Are in the middle of a payment

In these situations, a prompt or custom UI should be shown to the user to confirm they want to navigate away.

- If the user confirms, navigation will continue as normal
- If the user cancels, all pending navigations will be blocked

## How does navigation blocking work?

Navigation blocking adds one or more layers of "blockers" to the entire underlying history API. If any blockers are present, navigation will be paused via one of the following ways:

- Custom UI
  - If the navigation is triggered by something we control at the router level, we can allow you to perform any task or show any UI you'd like to the user to confirm the action. Each blocker's `blocker` function will be asynchronously and sequentially executed. If any blocker function resolves or returns `true`, the navigation will be allowed and all other blockers will continue to do the same until all blockers have been allowed to proceed. If any single blocker resolves or returns `false`, the navigation will be canceled and the rest of the `blocker` functions will be ignored.
- The `onbeforeunload` event
  - For page events that we cannot control directly, we rely on the browser's `onbeforeunload` event. If the user attempts to close the tab or window, refresh, or "unload" the page assets in any way, the browser's generic "Are you sure you want to leave?" dialog will be shown. If the user confirms, all blockers will be bypassed and the page will unload. If the user cancels, the unload will be cancelled, and the page will remain as is.

## How do I use navigation blocking?

There are 2 ways to use navigation blocking:

- Hook/logical-based blocking
- Component-based blocking

## Hook/logical-based blocking

Let's imagine we want to prevent navigation if a form is dirty. We can do this by using the `useBlocker` hook:

[//]: # "HookBasedBlockingExample"

```tsx
import { useBlocker } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function MyComponent() {
  const [formIsDirty, setFormIsDirty] = useState(false);

  useBlocker({
    shouldBlockFn: () => {
      if (!formIsDirty) return false;

      const shouldLeave = confirm("Are you sure you want to leave?");
      return !shouldLeave;
    },
  });

  // ...
}
```

[//]: # "HookBasedBlockingExample"

`shouldBlockFn` gives you type safe access to the `current` and `next` location:

```tsx
import { useBlocker } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function MyComponent() {
  // always block going from /foo to /bar/123?hello=world
  const { proceed, reset, status } = useBlocker({
    shouldBlockFn: ({ current, next }) => {
      return (
        current.routeId === "/foo" &&
        next.fullPath === "/bar/$id" &&
        next.params.id === 123 &&
        next.search.hello === "world"
      );
    },
    withResolver: true,
  });

  // ...
}
```

Note that even if `shouldBlockFn` returns `false`, the browser's `beforeunload` event may still be triggered on page reloads or tab closing. To gain control over this, you can use the `enableBeforeUnload` option to conditionally register the `beforeunload` handler:

[//]: # "HookBasedBlockingExample"

```tsx
import { useBlocker } from '@tanstack/react-router'

function MyComponent() {
  const [formIsDirty, setFormIsDirty] = useState(false)

  useBlocker({
    {/* ... */}
    enableBeforeUnload: formIsDirty, // or () => formIsDirty
  })

  // ...
}
```

You can find more information about the `useBlocker` hook in the [API reference](../../api/router/useBlockerHook.md).

## Component-based blocking

In addition to logical/hook based blocking, you can use the `Block` component to achieve similar results:

[//]: # "ComponentBasedBlockingExample"

```tsx
import { Block } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function MyComponent() {
  const [formIsDirty, setFormIsDirty] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Block
      shouldBlockFn={() => {
        if (!formIsDirty) return false;

        const shouldLeave = confirm("Are you sure you want to leave?");
        return !shouldLeave;
      }}
      enableBeforeUnload={formIsDirty}
    />
  );

  // OR

  return (
    <Block
      shouldBlockFn={() => formIsDirty}
      enableBeforeUnload={formIsDirty}
      withResolver
    >
      {({ status, proceed, reset }) => <>{/* ... */}</>}
    </Block>
  );
}
```

[//]: # "ComponentBasedBlockingExample"

## How can I show a custom UI?

In most cases, using `window.confirm` in the `shouldBlockFn` function with `withResolver: false` in the hook is enough since it will clearly show the user that the navigation is being blocked and resolve the blocking based on their response.

However, in some situations, you might want to show a custom UI that is intentionally less disruptive and more integrated with your app's design.

**Note:** The return value of `shouldBlockFn` does not resolve the blocking if `withResolver` is `true`.

### Hook/logical-based custom UI with resolver

[//]: # "HookBasedCustomUIBlockingWithResolverExample"

```tsx
import { useBlocker } from '@tanstack/react-router'

function MyComponent() {
  const [formIsDirty, setFormIsDirty] = useState(false)

  const { proceed, reset, status } = useBlocker({
    shouldBlockFn: () => formIsDirty,
    withResolver: true,
  })

  // ...

  return (
    <>
      {/* ... */}
      {status === 'blocked' && (
        <div>
          <p>Are you sure you want to leave?</p>
          <button onClick={proceed}>Yes</button>
          <button onClick={reset}>No</button>
        </div>
      )}
    </>
}
```

[//]: # "HookBasedCustomUIBlockingWithResolverExample"

### Hook/logical-based custom UI without resolver

[//]: # "HookBasedCustomUIBlockingWithoutResolverExample"

```tsx
import { useBlocker } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function MyComponent() {
  const [formIsDirty, setFormIsDirty] = useState(false);

  useBlocker({
    shouldBlockFn: () => {
      if (!formIsDirty) {
        return false;
      }

      const shouldBlock = new Promise<boolean>((resolve) => {
        // Using a modal manager of your choice
        modals.open({
          title: "Are you sure you want to leave?",
          children: (
            <SaveBlocker
              confirm={() => {
                modals.closeAll();
                resolve(false);
              }}
              reject={() => {
                modals.closeAll();
                resolve(true);
              }}
            />
          ),
          onClose: () => resolve(true),
        });
      });
      return shouldBlock;
    },
  });

  // ...
}
```

[//]: # "HookBasedCustomUIBlockingWithoutResolverExample"

### Component-based custom UI

Similarly to the hook, the `Block` component returns the same state and functions as render props:

[//]: # "ComponentBasedCustomUIBlockingExample"

```tsx
import { Block } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function MyComponent() {
  const [formIsDirty, setFormIsDirty] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Block shouldBlockFn={() => formIsDirty} withResolver>
      {({ status, proceed, reset }) => (
        <>
          {/* ... */}
          {status === "blocked" && (
            <div>
              <p>Are you sure you want to leave?</p>
              <button onClick={proceed}>Yes</button>
              <button onClick={reset}>No</button>
            </div>
          )}
        </>
      )}
    </Block>
  );
}
```

## Everything is Relative

Believe it or not, every navigation within an app is **relative**, even if you aren't using explicit relative path syntax (`../../somewhere`). Any time a link is clicked or an imperative navigation call is made, you will always have an **origin** path and a **destination** path which means you are navigating **from** one route **to** another route.

TanStack Router keeps this constant concept of relative navigation in mind for every navigation, so you'll constantly see two properties in the API:

- `from` - The origin route path
- `to` - The destination route path

> ⚠️ If a `from` route path isn't provided the router will assume you are navigating from the root `/` route and only auto-complete absolute paths. After all, you need to know where you are from in order to know where you're going 😉.

## Shared Navigation API

Every navigation and route matching API in TanStack Router uses the same core interface with minor differences depending on the API. This means that you can learn navigation and route matching once and use the same syntax and concepts across the library.

### `ToOptions` Interface

This is the core `ToOptions` interface that is used in every navigation and route matching API:

```ts
type ToOptions<
  TRouteTree extends AnyRoute = AnyRoute,
  TFrom extends RoutePaths<TRouteTree> | string = string,
  TTo extends string = "",
> = {
  // `from` is an optional route ID or path. If it is not supplied, only absolute paths will be auto-completed and type-safe. It's common to supply the route.fullPath of the origin route you are rendering from for convenience. If you don't know the origin route, leave this empty and work with absolute paths or unsafe relative paths.
  from: string;
  // `to` can be an absolute route path or a relative path from the `from` option to a valid route path. ⚠️ Do not interpolate path params, hash or search params into the `to` options. Use the `params`, `search`, and `hash` options instead.
  to: string;
  // `params` is either an object of path params to interpolate into the `to` option or a function that supplies the previous params and allows you to return new ones. This is the only way to interpolate dynamic parameters into the final URL. Depending on the `from` and `to` route, you may need to supply none, some or all of the path params. TypeScript will notify you of the required params if there are any.
  params:
    | Record<string, unknown>
    | ((prevParams: Record<string, unknown>) => Record<string, unknown>);
  // `search` is either an object of query params or a function that supplies the previous search and allows you to return new ones. Depending on the `from` and `to` route, you may need to supply none, some or all of the query params. TypeScript will notify you of the required search params if there are any.
  search:
    | Record<string, unknown>
    | ((prevSearch: Record<string, unknown>) => Record<string, unknown>);
  // `hash` is either a string or a function that supplies the previous hash and allows you to return a new one.
  hash?: string | ((prevHash: string) => string);
  // `state` is either an object of state or a function that supplies the previous state and allows you to return a new one. State is stored in the history API and can be useful for passing data between routes that you do not want to permanently store in URL search params.
  state?:
    | Record<string, any>
    | ((prevState: Record<string, unknown>) => Record<string, unknown>);
};
```

> 🧠 Every route object has a `to` property, which can be used as the `to` for any navigation or route matching API. Where possible, this will allow you to avoid plain strings and use type-safe route references instead:

```tsx
import { Route as aboutRoute } from "./routes/about.tsx";

function Comp() {
  return <Link to={aboutRoute.to}>About</Link>;
}
```

### `NavigateOptions` Interface

This is the core `NavigateOptions` interface that extends `ToOptions`. Any API that is actually performing a navigation will use this interface:

```ts
export type NavigateOptions<
  TRouteTree extends AnyRoute = AnyRoute,
  TFrom extends RoutePaths<TRouteTree> | string = string,
  TTo extends string = "",
> = ToOptions<TRouteTree, TFrom, TTo> & {
  // `replace` is a boolean that determines whether the navigation should replace the current history entry or push a new one.
  replace?: boolean;
  // `resetScroll` is a boolean that determines whether scroll position will be reset to 0,0 after the location is committed to browser history.
  resetScroll?: boolean;
  // `hashScrollIntoView` is a boolean or object that determines whether an id matching the hash will be scrolled into view after the location is committed to history.
  hashScrollIntoView?: boolean | ScrollIntoViewOptions;
  // `viewTransition` is either a boolean or function that determines if and how the browser will call document.startViewTransition() when navigating.
  viewTransition?: boolean | ViewTransitionOptions;
  // `ignoreBlocker` is a boolean that determines if navigation should ignore any blockers that might prevent it.
  ignoreBlocker?: boolean;
  // `reloadDocument` is a boolean that determines if navigation to a route inside of router will trigger a full page load instead of the traditional SPA navigation.
  reloadDocument?: boolean;
  // `href` is a string that can be used in place of `to` to navigate to a full built href, e.g. pointing to an external target.
  href?: string;
};
```

### `LinkOptions` Interface

Anywhere an actual `<a>` tag the `LinkOptions` interface which extends `NavigateOptions` will be available:

```tsx
export type LinkOptions<
  TRouteTree extends AnyRoute = AnyRoute,
  TFrom extends RoutePaths<TRouteTree> | string = string,
  TTo extends string = "",
> = NavigateOptions<TRouteTree, TFrom, TTo> & {
  // The standard anchor tag target attribute
  target?: HTMLAnchorElement["target"];
  // Defaults to `{ exact: false, includeHash: false }`
  activeOptions?: {
    exact?: boolean;
    includeHash?: boolean;
    includeSearch?: boolean;
    explicitUndefined?: boolean;
  };
  // If set, will preload the linked route on hover and cache it for this many milliseconds in hopes that the user will eventually navigate there.
  preload?: false | "intent";
  // Delay intent preloading by this many milliseconds. If the intent exits before this delay, the preload will be cancelled.
  preloadDelay?: number;
  // If true, will render the link without the href attribute
  disabled?: boolean;
};
```

## Navigation API

With relative navigation and all of the interfaces in mind now, let's talk about the different flavors of navigation API at your disposal:

- The `<Link>` component
  - Generates an actual `<a>` tag with a valid `href` which can be click or even cmd/ctrl + clicked to open in a new tab
- The `useNavigate()` hook
  - When possible, `Link` component should be used for navigation, but sometimes you need to navigate imperatively as a result of a side-effect. `useNavigate` returns a function that can be called to perform an immediate client-side navigation.
- The `<Navigate>` component
  - Renders nothing and performs an immediate client-side navigation.
- The `Router.navigate()` method
  - This is the most powerful navigation API in TanStack Router. Similar to `useNavigate`, it imperatively navigates, but is available everywhere you have access to your router.

⚠️ None of these APIs are a replacement for server-side redirects. If you need to redirect a user immediately from one route to another before mounting your application, use a server-side redirect instead of a client-side navigation.

## `<Link>` Component

The `Link` component is the most common way to navigate within an app. It renders an actual `<a>` tag with a valid `href` attribute which can be clicked or even cmd/ctrl + clicked to open in a new tab. It also supports any normal `<a>` attributes including `target` to open links in new windows, etc.

In addition to the [`LinkOptions`](#linkoptions-interface) interface, the `Link` component also supports the following props:

```tsx
export type LinkProps<
  TFrom extends RoutePaths<RegisteredRouter["routeTree"]> | string = string,
  TTo extends string = "",
> = LinkOptions<RegisteredRouter["routeTree"], TFrom, TTo> & {
  // A function that returns additional props for the `active` state of this link. These props override other props passed to the link (`style`'s are merged, `className`'s are concatenated)
  activeProps?: FrameworkHTMLAnchorTagAttributes | (() => FrameworkHTMLAnchorAttributes);
  // A function that returns additional props for the `inactive` state of this link. These props override other props passed to the link (`style`'s are merged, `className`'s are concatenated)
  inactiveProps?: FrameworkHTMLAnchorAttributes | (() => FrameworkHTMLAnchorAttributes);
};
```

### Absolute Links

Let's make a simple static link!

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const link = <Link to="/about">About</Link>;
```

### Dynamic Links

Dynamic links are links that have dynamic segments in them. For example, a link to a blog post might look like this:

```tsx
const link = (
  <Link
    to="/blog/post/$postId"
    params={{
      postId: "my-first-blog-post",
    }}
  >
    Blog Post
  </Link>
);
```

Keep in mind that normally dynamic segment params are `string` values, but they can also be any other type that you parse them to in your route options. Either way, the type will be checked at compile time to ensure that you are passing the correct type.

### Relative Links

By default, all links are absolute unless a `from` route path is provided. This means that the above link will always navigate to the `/about` route regardless of what route you are currently on.

If you want to make a link that is relative to the current route, you can provide a `from` route path:

```tsx
const postIdRoute = createRoute({
  path: "/blog/post/$postId",
});

const link = (
  <Link from={postIdRoute.fullPath} to="../categories">
    Categories
  </Link>
);
```

As seen above, it's common to provide the `route.fullPath` as the `from` route path. This is because the `route.fullPath` is a reference that will update if you refactor your application. However, sometimes it's not possible to import the route directly, in which case it's fine to provide the route path directly as a string. It will still get type-checked as per usual!

### Special relative paths: `"."` and `".."`

Quite often you might want to reload the current location, for example, to rerun the loaders on the current and/or parent routes, or maybe there was a change in search parameters. This can be achieved by specifying a `to` route path of `"."` which will reload the current location. This is only applicable to the current location, and hence any `from` route path specified is ignored.

Another common need is to navigate one route back relative to the current location or some other matched route in the current tree. By specifying a `to` route path of `".."` navigation will be resolved to either the first parent route preceding the current location or, if specified, preceding the `"from"` route path.

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  component: PostComponent,
});

function PostComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link to=".">Reload the current route of /posts/$postId</Link>
      <Link to="..">Navigate to /posts</Link>
      <Link from="/posts" to="..">
        Navigate to root
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Search Param Links

Search params are a great way to provide additional context to a route. For example, you might want to provide a search query to a search page:

```tsx
const link = (
  <Link
    to="/search"
    search={{
      query: "tanstack",
    }}
  >
    Search
  </Link>
);
```

It's also common to want to update a single search param without supplying any other information about the existing route. For example, you might want to update the page number of a search result:

```tsx
const link = (
  <Link
    to="."
    search={(prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      page: prev.page + 1,
    })}
  >
    Next Page
  </Link>
);
```

### Search Param Type Safety

Search params are a highly dynamic state management mechanism, so it's important to ensure that you are passing the correct types to your search params. We'll see in a later section in detail how to validate and ensure search params typesafety, among other great features!

### Hash Links

Hash links are a great way to link to a specific section of a page. For example, you might want to link to a specific section of a blog post:

```tsx
const link = (
  <Link
    to="/blog/post/$postId"
    params={{
      postId: "my-first-blog-post",
    }}
    hash="section-1"
  >
    Section 1
  </Link>
);
```

### Navigating with Optional Parameters

Optional path parameters provide flexible navigation patterns where you can include or omit parameters as needed. Optional parameters use the `{-$paramName}` syntax and offer fine-grained control over URL structure.

#### Parameter Inheritance vs Removal

When navigating with optional parameters, you have two main strategies:

**Inheriting Current Parameters**
Use `params: {}` to inherit all current route parameters:

```tsx
// Inherits current route parameters
<Link to="/posts/{-$category}" params={{}}>
  All Posts
</Link>
```

**Removing Parameters**  
Set parameters to `undefined` to explicitly remove them:

```tsx
// Removes the category parameter
<Link to="/posts/{-$category}" params={{ category: undefined }}>
  All Posts
</Link>
```

#### Basic Optional Parameter Navigation

```tsx
// Navigate with optional parameter
<Link
  to="/posts/{-$category}"
  params={{ category: 'tech' }}
>
  Tech Posts
</Link>

// Navigate without optional parameter
<Link
  to="/posts/{-$category}"
  params={{ category: undefined }}
>
  All Posts
</Link>

// Navigate using parameter inheritance
<Link
  to="/posts/{-$category}"
  params={{}}
>
  Current Category
</Link>
```

#### Function-Style Parameter Updates

Function-style parameter updates are particularly useful with optional parameters:

```tsx
// Remove a parameter using function syntax
<Link
  to="/posts/{-$category}"
  params={(prev) => ({ ...prev, category: undefined })}
>
  Clear Category
</Link>

// Update a parameter while keeping others
<Link
  to="/articles/{-$category}/{-$slug}"
  params={(prev) => ({ ...prev, category: 'news' })}
>
  News Articles
</Link>

// Conditionally set parameters
<Link
  to="/posts/{-$category}"
  params={(prev) => ({
    ...prev,
    category: someCondition ? 'tech' : undefined
  })}
>
  Conditional Category
</Link>
```

#### Multiple Optional Parameters

When working with multiple optional parameters, you can mix and match which ones to include:

```tsx
// Navigate with some optional parameters
<Link
  to="/posts/{-$category}/{-$slug}"
  params={{ category: 'tech', slug: undefined }}
>
  Tech Posts
</Link>

// Remove all optional parameters
<Link
  to="/posts/{-$category}/{-$slug}"
  params={{ category: undefined, slug: undefined }}
>
  All Posts
</Link>

// Set multiple parameters
<Link
  to="/posts/{-$category}/{-$slug}"
  params={{ category: 'tech', slug: 'react-tips' }}
>
  Specific Post
</Link>
```

#### Mixed Required and Optional Parameters

Optional parameters work seamlessly with required parameters:

```tsx
// Required 'id', optional 'tab'
<Link
  to="/users/$id/{-$tab}"
  params={{ id: '123', tab: 'settings' }}
>
  User Settings
</Link>

// Remove optional parameter while keeping required
<Link
  to="/users/$id/{-$tab}"
  params={{ id: '123', tab: undefined }}
>
  User Profile
</Link>

// Use function style with mixed parameters
<Link
  to="/users/$id/{-$tab}"
  params={(prev) => ({ ...prev, tab: 'notifications' })}
>
  User Notifications
</Link>
```

#### Advanced Optional Parameter Patterns

**Prefix and Suffix Parameters**
Optional parameters with prefix/suffix work with navigation:

```tsx
// Navigate to file with optional name
<Link
  to="/files/prefix{-$name}.txt"
  params={{ name: 'document' }}
>
  Document File
</Link>

// Navigate to file without optional name
<Link
  to="/files/prefix{-$name}.txt"
  params={{ name: undefined }}
>
  Default File
</Link>
```

**All Optional Parameters**
Routes where all parameters are optional:

```tsx
// Navigate to specific date
<Link
  to="/{-$year}/{-$month}/{-$day}"
  params={{ year: '2023', month: '12', day: '25' }}
>
  Christmas 2023
</Link>

// Navigate to partial date
<Link
  to="/{-$year}/{-$month}/{-$day}"
  params={{ year: '2023', month: '12', day: undefined }}
>
  December 2023
</Link>

// Navigate to root with all parameters removed
<Link
  to="/{-$year}/{-$month}/{-$day}"
  params={{ year: undefined, month: undefined, day: undefined }}
>
  Home
</Link>
```

#### Navigation with Search Params and Optional Parameters

Optional parameters work great in combination with search params:

```tsx
// Combine optional path params with search params
<Link
  to="/posts/{-$category}"
  params={{ category: 'tech' }}
  search={{ page: 1, sort: 'newest' }}
>
  Tech Posts - Page 1
</Link>

// Remove path param but keep search params
<Link
  to="/posts/{-$category}"
  params={{ category: undefined }}
  search={(prev) => prev}
>
  All Posts - Same Filters
</Link>
```

#### Imperative Navigation with Optional Parameters

All the same patterns work with imperative navigation:

```tsx
function Component() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const clearFilters = () => {
    navigate({
      to: "/posts/{-$category}/{-$tag}",
      params: { category: undefined, tag: undefined },
    });
  };

  const setCategory = (category: string) => {
    navigate({
      to: "/posts/{-$category}/{-$tag}",
      params: (prev) => ({ ...prev, category }),
    });
  };

  const applyFilters = (category?: string, tag?: string) => {
    navigate({
      to: "/posts/{-$category}/{-$tag}",
      params: { category, tag },
    });
  };
}
```

### Active & Inactive Props

The `Link` component supports two additional props: `activeProps` and `inactiveProps`. These props are functions that return additional props for the `active` and `inactive` states of the link. All props other than styles and classes passed here will override the original props passed to `Link`. Any styles or classes passed are merged together.

Here's an example:

```tsx
const link = (
  <Link
    to="/blog/post/$postId"
    params={{
      postId: "my-first-blog-post",
    }}
    activeProps={{
      style: {
        fontWeight: "bold",
      },
    }}
  >
    Section 1
  </Link>
);
```

### The `data-status` attribute

In addition to the `activeProps` and `inactiveProps` props, the `Link` component also adds a `data-status` attribute to the rendered element when it is in an active state. This attribute will be `active` or `undefined` depending on the current state of the link. This can come in handy if you prefer to use data-attributes to style your links instead of props.

### Active Options

The `Link` component comes with an `activeOptions` property that offers a few options of determining if a link is active or not. The following interface describes those options:

```tsx
export interface ActiveOptions {
  // If true, the link will be active if the current route matches the `to` route path exactly (no children routes)
  // Defaults to `false`
  exact?: boolean;
  // If true, the link will only be active if the current URL hash matches the `hash` prop
  // Defaults to `false`
  includeHash?: boolean; // Defaults to false
  // If true, the link will only be active if the current URL search params inclusively match the `search` prop
  // Defaults to `true`
  includeSearch?: boolean;
  // This modifies the `includeSearch` behavior.
  // If true,  properties in `search` that are explicitly `undefined` must NOT be present in the current URL search params for the link to be active.
  // defaults to `false`
  explicitUndefined?: boolean;
}
```

By default, it will check if the resulting **pathname** is a prefix of the current route. If any search params are provided, it will check that they _inclusively_ match those in the current location. Hashes are not checked by default.

For example, if you are on the `/blog/post/my-first-blog-post` route, the following links will be active:

```tsx
const link1 = (
  <Link to="/blog/post/$postId" params={{ postId: "my-first-blog-post" }}>
    Blog Post
  </Link>
);
const link2 = <Link to="/blog/post">Blog Post</Link>;
const link3 = <Link to="/blog">Blog Post</Link>;
```

However, the following links will not be active:

```tsx
const link4 = (
  <Link to="/blog/post/$postId" params={{ postId: "my-second-blog-post" }}>
    Blog Post
  </Link>
);
```

It's common for some links to only be active if they are an exact match. A good example of this would be a link to the home page. In scenarios like these, you can pass the `exact: true` option:

```tsx
const link = (
  <Link to="/" activeOptions={{ exact: true }}>
    Home
  </Link>
);
```

This will ensure that the link is not active when you are a child route.

A few more options to be aware of:

- If you want to include the hash in your matching, you can pass the `includeHash: true` option
- If you do **not** want to include the search params in your matching, you can pass the `includeSearch: false` option

### Passing `isActive` to children

The `Link` component accepts a function for its children, allowing you to propagate its `isActive` property to children. For example, you could style a child component based on whether the parent link is active:

```tsx
const link = (
  <Link to="/blog/post">
    {({ isActive }) => {
      return (
        <>
          <span>My Blog Post</span>
          <icon className={isActive ? "active" : "inactive"} />
        </>
      );
    }}
  </Link>
);
```

### Link Preloading

The `Link` component supports automatically preloading routes on intent (hovering or touchstart for now). This can be configured as a default in the router options (which we'll talk more about soon) or by passing a `preload='intent'` prop to the `Link` component. Here's an example:

```tsx
const link = (
  <Link to="/blog/post/$postId" preload="intent">
    Blog Post
  </Link>
);
```

With preloading enabled and relatively quick asynchronous route dependencies (if any), this simple trick can increase the perceived performance of your application with very little effort.

What's even better is that by using a cache-first library like `@tanstack/query`, preloaded routes will stick around and be ready for a stale-while-revalidate experience if the user decides to navigate to the route later on.

### Link Preloading Timeout

Along with preloading is a configurable timeout which determines how long a user must hover over a link to trigger the intent-based preloading. The default timeout is 50 milliseconds, but you can change this by passing a `preloadTimeout` prop to the `Link` component with the number of milliseconds you'd like to wait:

```tsx
const link = (
  <Link to="/blog/post/$postId" preload="intent" preloadTimeout={100}>
    Blog Post
  </Link>
);
```

## `useNavigate`

> ⚠️ Because of the `Link` component's built-in affordances around `href`, cmd/ctrl + click-ability, and active/inactive capabilities, it's recommended to use the `Link` component instead of `useNavigate` for anything the user can interact with (e.g. links, buttons). However, there are some cases where `useNavigate` is necessary to handle side-effect navigations (e.g. a successful async action that results in a navigation).

The `useNavigate` hook returns a `navigate` function that can be called to imperatively navigate. It's a great way to navigate to a route from a side-effect (e.g. a successful async action). Here's an example:

```tsx
function Component() {
  const navigate = useNavigate({ from: "/posts/$postId" });

  const handleSubmit = async (e: FrameworkFormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();

    const response = await fetch("/posts", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({ title: "My First Post" }),
    });

    const { id: postId } = await response.json();

    if (response.ok) {
      navigate({ to: "/posts/$postId", params: { postId } });
    }
  };
}
```

> 🧠 As shown above, you can pass the `from` option to specify the route to navigate from in the hook call. While this is also possible to pass in the resulting `navigate` function each time you call it, it's recommended to pass it here to reduce on potential error and also not type as much!

### `navigate` Options

The `navigate` function returned by `useNavigate` accepts the [`NavigateOptions` interface](#navigateoptions-interface)

## `Navigate` Component

Occasionally, you may find yourself needing to navigate immediately when a component mounts. Your first instinct might be to reach for `useNavigate` and an immediate side-effect (e.g. useEffect), but this is unnecessary. Instead, you can render the `Navigate` component to achieve the same result:

```tsx
function Component() {
  return <Navigate to="/posts/$postId" params={{ postId: "my-first-post" }} />;
}
```

Think of the `Navigate` component as a way to navigate to a route immediately when a component mounts. It's a great way to handle client-only redirects. It is _definitely not_ a substitute for handling server-aware redirects responsibly on the server.

## `router.navigate`

The `router.navigate` method is the same as the `navigate` function returned by `useNavigate` and accepts the same [`NavigateOptions` interface](#navigateoptions-interface). Unlike the `useNavigate` hook, it is available anywhere your `router` instance is available and is thus a great way to navigate imperatively from anywhere in your application, including outside of your framework.

## `useMatchRoute` and `<MatchRoute>`

The `useMatchRoute` hook and `<MatchRoute>` component are the same thing, but the hook is a bit more flexible. They both accept the standard navigation `ToOptions` interface either as options or props and return `true/false` if that route is currently matched. It also has a handy `pending` option that will return `true` if the route is currently pending (e.g. a route is currently transitioning to that route). This can be extremely useful for showing optimistic UI around where a user is navigating:

```tsx
function Component() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link to="/users">
        Users
        <MatchRoute to="/users" pending>
          <Spinner />
        </MatchRoute>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The component version `<MatchRoute>` can also be used with a function as children to render something when the route is matched:

```tsx
function Component() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link to="/users">
        Users
        <MatchRoute to="/users" pending>
          {(match) => {
            return <Spinner show={match} />;
          }}
        </MatchRoute>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The hook version `useMatchRoute` returns a function that can be called programmatically to check if a route is matched:

```tsx
function Component() {
  const matchRoute = useMatchRoute();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (matchRoute({ to: "/users", pending: true })) {
      console.info("The /users route is matched and pending");
    }
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <Link to="/users">Users</Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Phew! That's a lot of navigating! That said, hopefully you're feeling pretty good about getting around your application now. Let's move on!

title: Not Found Errors
---

> ⚠️ This page covers the newer `notFound` function and `notFoundComponent` API for handling not found errors. The `NotFoundRoute` route is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. See [Migrating from `NotFoundRoute`](#migrating-from-notfoundroute) for more information.

## Overview

There are 2 uses for not-found errors in TanStack Router:

- **Non-matching route paths**: When a path does not match any known route matching pattern **OR** when it partially matches a route, but with extra path segments
  - The **router** will automatically throw a not-found error when a path does not match any known route matching pattern
  - If the router's `notFoundMode` is set to `fuzzy`, the nearest parent route with a `notFoundComponent` will handle the error. If the router's `notFoundMode` is set to `root`, the root route will handle the error.
  - Examples:
    - Attempting to access `/users` when there is no `/users` route
    - Attempting to access `/posts/1/edit` when the route tree only handles `/posts/$postId`
- **Missing resources**: When a resource cannot be found, such as a post with a given ID or any asynchronous data that is not available or does not exist
  - **You, the developer** must throw a not-found error when a resource cannot be found. This can be done in the `beforeLoad` or `loader` functions using the `notFound` utility.
  - Will be handled by the nearest parent route with a `notFoundComponent` (when `notFound` is called within `loader`) or the root route.
  - Examples:
    - Attempting to access `/posts/1` when the post with ID 1 does not exist
    - Attempting to access `/docs/path/to/document` when the document does not exist

Under the hood, both of these cases are implemented using the same `notFound` function and `notFoundComponent` API.

## The `notFoundMode` option

When TanStack Router encounters a **pathname** that doesn't match any known route pattern **OR** partially matches a route pattern but with extra trailing pathname segments, it will automatically throw a not-found error.

Depending on the `notFoundMode` option, the router will handle these automatic errors differently::

- ["fuzzy" mode](#notfoundmode-fuzzy) (default): The router will intelligently find the closest matching suitable route and display the `notFoundComponent`.
- ["root" mode](#notfoundmode-root): All not-found errors will be handled by the root route's `notFoundComponent`, regardless of the nearest matching route.

### `notFoundMode: 'fuzzy'`

By default, the router's `notFoundMode` is set to `fuzzy`, which indicates that if a pathname doesn't match any known route, the router will attempt to use the closest matching route with children/(an outlet) and a configured not found component.

> **❓ Why is this the default?** Fuzzy matching to preserve as much parent layout as possible for the user gives them more context to navigate to a useful location based on where they thought they would arrive.

The nearest suitable route is found using the following criteria:

- The route must have children and therefore an `Outlet` to render the `notFoundComponent`
- The route must have a `notFoundComponent` configured or the router must have a `defaultNotFoundComponent` configured

For example, consider the following route tree:

- `__root__` (has a `notFoundComponent` configured)
  - `posts` (has a `notFoundComponent` configured)
    - `$postId` (has a `notFoundComponent` configured)

If provided the path of `/posts/1/edit`, the following component structure will be rendered:

- `<Root>`
  - `<Posts>`
    - `<Posts.notFoundComponent>`

The `notFoundComponent` of the `posts` route will be rendered because it is the **nearest suitable parent route with children (and therefore an outlet) and a `notFoundComponent` configured**.

### `notFoundMode: 'root'`

When `notFoundMode` is set to `root`, all not-found errors will be handled by the root route's `notFoundComponent` instead of bubbling up from the nearest fuzzy-matched route.

For example, consider the following route tree:

- `__root__` (has a `notFoundComponent` configured)
  - `posts` (has a `notFoundComponent` configured)
    - `$postId` (has a `notFoundComponent` configured)

If provided the path of `/posts/1/edit`, the following component structure will be rendered:

- `<Root>`
  - `<Root.notFoundComponent>`

The `notFoundComponent` of the `__root__` route will be rendered because the `notFoundMode` is set to `root`.

## Configuring a route's `notFoundComponent`

To handle both types of not-found errors, you can attach a `notFoundComponent` to a route. This component will be rendered when a not-found error is thrown.

For example, configuring a `notFoundComponent` for a `/settings` route to handle non-existing settings pages:

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/settings")({
  component: () => {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Settings page</p>
        <Outlet />
      </div>
    );
  },
  notFoundComponent: () => {
    return <p>This setting page doesn't exist!</p>;
  },
});
```

Or configuring a `notFoundComponent` for a `/posts/$postId` route to handle posts that don't exist:

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  loader: async ({ params: { postId } }) => {
    const post = await getPost(postId);
    if (!post) throw notFound();
    return { post };
  },
  component: ({ post }) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{post.title}</h1>
        <p>{post.body}</p>
      </div>
    );
  },
  notFoundComponent: () => {
    return <p>Post not found!</p>;
  },
});
```

## Default Router-Wide Not Found Handling

You may want to provide a default not-found component for every route in your app with child routes.

> Why only routes with children? **Leaf-node routes (routes without children) will never render an `Outlet` and therefore are not able to handle not-found errors.**

To do this, pass a `defaultNotFoundComponent` to the `createRouter` function:

```tsx
const router = createRouter({
  defaultNotFoundComponent: () => {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Not found!</p>
        <Link to="/">Go home</Link>
      </div>
    );
  },
});
```

## Throwing your own `notFound` errors

You can manually throw not-found errors in loader methods and components using the `notFound` function. This is useful when you need to signal that a resource cannot be found.

The `notFound` function works in a similar fashion to the `redirect` function. To cause a not-found error, you can **throw a `notFound()`**.

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  loader: async ({ params: { postId } }) => {
    // Returns `null` if the post doesn't exist
    const post = await getPost(postId);
    if (!post) {
      throw notFound();
      // Alternatively, you can make the notFound function throw:
      // notFound({ throw: true })
    }
    // Post is guaranteed to be defined here because we threw an error
    return { post };
  },
});
```

The not-found error above will be handled by the same route or nearest parent route that has either a `notFoundComponent` route option or the `defaultNotFoundComponent` router option configured.

If neither the route nor any suitable parent route is found to handle the error, the root route will handle it using TanStack Router's **extremely basic (and purposefully undesirable)** default not-found component that simply renders `<div>Not Found</div>`. It's highly recommended to either attach at least one `notFoundComponent` to the root route or configure a router-wide `defaultNotFoundComponent` to handle not-found errors.

## Specifying Which Routes Handle Not Found Errors

Sometimes you may want to trigger a not-found on a specific parent route and bypass the normal not-found component propagation. To do this, pass in a route id to the `route` option in the `notFound` function.

```tsx
// _pathlessLayout.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/_pathlessLayout")({
  // This will render
  notFoundComponent: () => {
    return <p>Not found (in _pathlessLayout)</p>;
  },
  component: () => {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>This is a pathless layout route!</p>
        <Outlet />
      </div>
    );
  },
});

// _pathlessLayout/route-a.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/_pathless/route-a")({
  loader: async () => {
    // This will make LayoutRoute handle the not-found error
    throw notFound({ routeId: "/_pathlessLayout" });
    //                      ^^^^^^^^^ This will autocomplete from the registered router
  },
  // This WILL NOT render
  notFoundComponent: () => {
    return <p>Not found (in _pathlessLayout/route-a)</p>;
  },
});
```

### Manually targeting the root route

You can also target the root route by passing the exported `rootRouteId` variable to the `notFound` function's `route` property:

```tsx
import { rootRouteId } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  loader: async ({ params: { postId } }) => {
    const post = await getPost(postId);
    if (!post) throw notFound({ routeId: rootRouteId });
    return { post };
  },
});
```

### Throwing Not Found Errors in Components

You can also throw not-found errors in components. However, **it is recommended to throw not-found errors in loader methods instead of components in order to correctly type loader data and prevent flickering.**

TanStack Router exposes a `CatchNotFound` component similar to `CatchBoundary` that can be used to catch not-found errors in components and display UI accordingly.

### Data Loading Inside `notFoundComponent`

`notFoundComponent` is a special case when it comes to data loading. **`SomeRoute.useLoaderData` may not be defined depending on which route you are trying to access and where the not-found error gets thrown**. However, `Route.useParams`, `Route.useSearch`, `Route.useRouteContext`, etc. will return a defined value.

**If you need to pass incomplete loader data to `notFoundComponent`,** pass the data via the `data` option in the `notFound` function and validate it in `notFoundComponent`.

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  loader: async ({ params: { postId } }) => {
    const post = await getPost(postId);
    if (!post)
      throw notFound({
        // Forward some data to the notFoundComponent
        // data: someIncompleteLoaderData
      });
    return { post };
  },
  // `data: unknown` is passed to the component via the `data` option when calling `notFound`
  notFoundComponent: ({ data }) => {
    // ❌ useLoaderData is not valid here: const { post } = Route.useLoaderData()

    // ✅:
    const { postId } = Route.useParams();
    const search = Route.useSearch();
    const context = Route.useRouteContext();

    return <p>Post with id {postId} not found!</p>;
  },
});
```

## Usage With SSR

See [SSR guide](../ssr.md) for more information.

## Migrating from `NotFoundRoute`

The `NotFoundRoute` API is deprecated in favor of `notFoundComponent`. The `NotFoundRoute` API will be removed in a future release.

**The `notFound` function and `notFoundComponent` will not work when using `NotFoundRoute`.**

The main differences are:

- `NotFoundRoute` is a route that requires an `<Outlet>` on its parent route to render. `notFoundComponent` is a component that can be attached to any route.
- When using `NotFoundRoute`, you can't use layouts. `notFoundComponent` can be used with layouts.
- When using `notFoundComponent`, path matching is strict. This means that if you have a route at `/post/$postId`, a not-found error will be thrown if you try to access `/post/1/2/3`. With `NotFoundRoute`, `/post/1/2/3` would match the `NotFoundRoute` and only render it if there is an `<Outlet>`.

To migrate from `NotFoundRoute` to `notFoundComponent`, you'll just need to make a few changes:

```tsx
// router.tsx
import { createRouter } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { routeTree } from './routeTree.gen.'
- import { notFoundRoute } from './notFoundRoute'  // [!code --]

export const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
- notFoundRoute // [!code --]
})

// routes/__root.tsx
import { createRootRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  // ...
+ notFoundComponent: () => {  // [!code ++]
+   return <p>Not found!</p>  // [!code ++]
+ } // [!code ++]
})
```

Important changes:

- A `notFoundComponent` is added to the root route for global not-found handling.
  - You can also add a `notFoundComponent` to any other route in your route tree to handle not-found errors for that specific route.
- The `notFoundComponent` does not support rendering an `<Outlet>`.

Nested routing means that routes can be nested within other routes, including the way they render. So how do we tell our routes where to render this nested content?

## The `Outlet` Component

The `Outlet` component is used to render the next potentially matching child route. `<Outlet />` doesn't take any props and can be rendered anywhere within a route's component tree. If there is no matching child route, `<Outlet />` will render `null`.

> [!TIP]
> If a route's `component` is left undefined, it will render an `<Outlet />` automatically.

A great example is configuring the root route of your application. Let's give our root route a component that renders a title, then an `<Outlet />` for our top-level routes to render.

```tsx
import { createRootRoute, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: RootComponent,
});

function RootComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <Outlet /> {/* This is where child routes will render */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
</file>

<file path="docs/react/guide/path-params.md">

title: Path Params
---

Path params are used to match a single segment (the text until the next `/`) and provide its value back to you as a **named** variable. They are defined by using the `$` character prefix in the path, followed by the key variable to assign it to. The following are valid path param paths:

- `$postId`
- `$name`
- `$teamId`
- `about/$name`
- `team/$teamId`
- `blog/$postId`

Because path param routes only match to the next `/`, child routes can be created to continue expressing hierarchy:

Let's create a post route file that uses a path param to match the post ID:

- `posts.$postId.tsx`

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  loader: async ({ params }) => {
    return fetchPost(params.postId);
  },
});
```

## Path Params can be used by child routes

Once a path param has been parsed, it is available to all child routes. This means that if we define a child route to our `postRoute`, we can use the `postId` variable from the URL in the child route's path!

## Path Params in Loaders

Path params are passed to the loader as a `params` object. The keys of this object are the names of the path params, and the values are the values that were parsed out of the actual URL path. For example, if we were to visit the `/blog/123` URL, the `params` object would be `{ postId: '123' }`:

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  loader: async ({ params }) => {
    return fetchPost(params.postId);
  },
});
```

The `params` object is also passed to the `beforeLoad` option:

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  beforeLoad: async ({ params }) => {
    // do something with params.postId
  },
});
```

## Path Params in Components

If we add a component to our `postRoute`, we can access the `postId` variable from the URL by using the route's `useParams` hook:

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  component: PostComponent,
});

function PostComponent() {
  const { postId } = Route.useParams();
  return <div>Post {postId}</div>;
}
```

> 🧠 Quick tip: If your component is code-split, you can use the [getRouteApi function](../code-splitting.md#manually-accessing-route-apis-in-other-files-with-the-getrouteapi-helper) to avoid having to import the `Route` configuration to get access to the typed `useParams()` hook.

## Path Params outside of Routes

You can also use the globally exported `useParams` hook to access any parsed path params from any component in your app. You'll need to pass the `strict: false` option to `useParams`, denoting that you want to access the params from an ambiguous location:

```tsx
function PostComponent() {
  const { postId } = useParams({ strict: false });
  return <div>Post {postId}</div>;
}
```

## Navigating with Path Params

When navigating to a route with path params, TypeScript will require you to pass the params either as an object or as a function that returns an object of params.

Let's see what an object style looks like:

```tsx
function Component() {
  return (
    <Link to="/blog/$postId" params={{ postId: "123" }}>
      Post 123
    </Link>
  );
}
```

And here's what a function style looks like:

```tsx
function Component() {
  return (
    <Link to="/blog/$postId" params={(prev) => ({ ...prev, postId: "123" })}>
      Post 123
    </Link>
  );
}
```

Notice that the function style is useful when you need to persist params that are already in the URL for other routes. This is because the function style will receive the current params as an argument, allowing you to modify them as needed and return the final params object.

## Prefixes and Suffixes for Path Params

You can also use **prefixes** and **suffixes** with path params to create more complex routing patterns. This allows you to match specific URL structures while still capturing the dynamic segments.

When using either prefixes or suffixes, you can define them by wrapping the path param in curly braces `{}` and placing the prefix or suffix before or after the variable name.

### Defining Prefixes

Prefixes are defined by placing the prefix text outside the curly braces before the variable name. For example, if you want to match a URL that starts with `post-` followed by a post ID, you can define it like this:

```tsx
// src/routes/posts/post-{$postId}.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/post-{$postId}")({
  component: PostComponent,
});

function PostComponent() {
  const { postId } = Route.useParams();
  // postId will be the value after 'post-'
  return <div>Post ID: {postId}</div>;
}
```

You can even combines prefixes with wildcard routes to create more complex patterns:

```tsx
// src/routes/on-disk/storage-{$}
export const Route = createFileRoute("/on-disk/storage-{$postId}/$")({
  component: StorageComponent,
});

function StorageComponent() {
  const { _splat } = Route.useParams();
  // _splat, will be value after 'storage-'
  // i.e. my-drive/documents/foo.txt
  return <div>Storage Location: /{_splat}</div>;
}
```

### Defining Suffixes

Suffixes are defined by placing the suffix text outside the curly braces after the variable name. For example, if you want to match a URL a filename that ends with `txt`, you can define it like this:

```tsx
// src/routes/files/{$fileName}txt
export const Route = createFileRoute("/files/{$fileName}.txt")({
  component: FileComponent,
});

function FileComponent() {
  const { fileName } = Route.useParams();
  // fileName will be the value before 'txt'
  return <div>File Name: {fileName}</div>;
}
```

You can also combine suffixes with wildcards for more complex routing patterns:

```tsx
// src/routes/files/{$}[.]txt
export const Route = createFileRoute("/files/{$fileName}[.]txt")({
  component: FileComponent,
});

function FileComponent() {
  const { _splat } = Route.useParams();
  // _splat will be the value before '.txt'
  return <div>File Splat: {_splat}</div>;
}
```

### Combining Prefixes and Suffixes

You can combine both prefixes and suffixes to create very specific routing patterns. For example, if you want to match a URL that starts with `user-` and ends with `.json`, you can define it like this:

```tsx
// src/routes/users/user-{$userId}person
export const Route = createFileRoute("/users/user-{$userId}person")({
  component: UserComponent,
});

function UserComponent() {
  const { userId } = Route.useParams();
  // userId will be the value between 'user-' and 'person'
  return <div>User ID: {userId}</div>;
}
```

Similar to the previous examples, you can also use wildcards with prefixes and suffixes. Go wild!

## Optional Path Parameters

Optional path parameters allow you to define route segments that may or may not be present in the URL. They use the `{-$paramName}` syntax and provide flexible routing patterns where certain parameters are optional.

### Defining Optional Parameters

Optional path parameters are defined using curly braces with a dash prefix: `{-$paramName}`

```tsx
// Single optional parameter
// src/routes/posts/{-$category}.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/{-$category}")({
  component: PostsComponent,
});

// Multiple optional parameters
// src/routes/posts/{-$category}/{-$slug}.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/{-$category}/{-$slug}")({
  component: PostComponent,
});

// Mixed required and optional parameters
// src/routes/users/$id/{-$tab}.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/users/$id/{-$tab}")({
  component: UserComponent,
});
```

### How Optional Parameters Work

Optional parameters create flexible URL patterns:

- `/posts/{-$category}` matches both `/posts` and `/posts/tech`
- `/posts/{-$category}/{-$slug}` matches `/posts`, `/posts/tech`, and `/posts/tech/hello-world`
- `/users/$id/{-$tab}` matches `/users/123` and `/users/123/settings`

When an optional parameter is not present in the URL, its value will be `undefined` in your route handlers and components.

### Accessing Optional Parameters

Optional parameters work exactly like regular parameters in your components, but their values may be `undefined`:

```tsx
function PostsComponent() {
  const { category } = Route.useParams();

  return <div>{category ? `Posts in ${category}` : "All Posts"}</div>;
}
```

### Optional Parameters in Loaders

Optional parameters are available in loaders and may be `undefined`:

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/{-$category}")({
  loader: async ({ params }) => {
    // params.category might be undefined
    return fetchPosts({ category: params.category });
  },
});
```

### Optional Parameters in beforeLoad

Optional parameters work in `beforeLoad` handlers as well:

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/{-$category}")({
  beforeLoad: async ({ params }) => {
    if (params.category) {
      // Validate category exists
      await validateCategory(params.category);
    }
  },
});
```

### Advanced Optional Parameter Patterns

#### With Prefix and Suffix

Optional parameters support prefix and suffix patterns:

```tsx
// File route: /files/prefix{-$name}.txt
// Matches: /files/prefix.txt and /files/prefixdocument.txt
export const Route = createFileRoute("/files/prefix{-$name}.txt")({
  component: FileComponent,
});

function FileComponent() {
  const { name } = Route.useParams();
  return <div>File: {name || "default"}</div>;
}
```

#### All Optional Parameters

You can create routes where all parameters are optional:

```tsx
// Route: /{-$year}/{-$month}/{-$day}
// Matches: /, /2023, /2023/12, /2023/12/25
export const Route = createFileRoute("/{-$year}/{-$month}/{-$day}")({
  component: DateComponent,
});

function DateComponent() {
  const { year, month, day } = Route.useParams();

  if (!year) return <div>Select a year</div>;
  if (!month) return <div>Year: {year}</div>;
  if (!day)
    return (
      <div>
        Month: {year}/{month}
      </div>
    );

  return (
    <div>
      Date: {year}/{month}/{day}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Optional Parameters with Wildcards

Optional parameters can be combined with wildcards for complex routing patterns:

```tsx
// Route: /docs/{-$version}/$
// Matches: /docs/extra/path, /docs/v2/extra/path
export const Route = createFileRoute("/docs/{-$version}/$")({
  component: DocsComponent,
});

function DocsComponent() {
  const { version } = Route.useParams();
  const { _splat } = Route.useParams();

  return (
    <div>
      Version: {version || "latest"}
      Path: {_splat}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Navigating with Optional Parameters

When navigating to routes with optional parameters, you have fine-grained control over which parameters to include:

```tsx
function Navigation() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Navigate with optional parameter */}
      <Link to="/posts/{-$category}" params={{ category: "tech" }}>
        Tech Posts
      </Link>

      {/* Navigate without optional parameter */}
      <Link to="/posts/{-$category}" params={{ category: undefined }}>
        All Posts
      </Link>

      {/* Navigate with multiple optional parameters */}
      <Link
        to="/posts/{-$category}/{-$slug}"
        params={{ category: "tech", slug: "react-tips" }}
      >
        Specific Post
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Type Safety with Optional Parameters

TypeScript provides full type safety for optional parameters:

```tsx
function PostsComponent() {
  // TypeScript knows category might be undefined
  const { category } = Route.useParams() // category: string | undefined

  // Safe navigation
  const categoryUpper = category?.toUpperCase()

  return <div>{categoryUpper || 'All Categories'}</div>
}

// Navigation is type-safe and flexible
<Link
  to="/posts/{-$category}"
  params={{ category: 'tech' }} // ✅ Valid - string
>
  Tech Posts
</Link>

<Link
  to="/posts/{-$category}"
  params={{ category: 123 }} // ✅ Valid - number (auto-stringified)
>
  Category 123
</Link>
```

## Internationalization (i18n) with Optional Path Parameters

Optional path parameters are excellent for implementing internationalization (i18n) routing patterns. You can use prefix patterns to handle multiple languages while maintaining clean, SEO-friendly URLs.

### Prefix-based i18n

Use optional language prefixes to support URLs like `/en/about`, `/fr/about`, or just `/about` (default language):

```tsx
// Route: /{-$locale}/about
export const Route = createFileRoute("/{-$locale}/about")({
  component: AboutComponent,
});

function AboutComponent() {
  const { locale } = Route.useParams();
  const currentLocale = locale || "en"; // Default to English

  const content = {
    en: { title: "About Us", description: "Learn more about our company." },
    fr: {
      title: "À Propos",
      description: "En savoir plus sur notre entreprise.",
    },
    es: {
      title: "Acerca de",
      description: "Conoce más sobre nuestra empresa.",
    },
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{content[currentLocale]?.title}</h1>
      <p>{content[currentLocale]?.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This pattern matches:

- `/about` (default locale)
- `/en/about` (explicit English)
- `/fr/about` (French)
- `/es/about` (Spanish)

### Complex i18n Patterns

Combine optional parameters for more sophisticated i18n routing:

```tsx
// Route: /{-$locale}/blog/{-$category}/$slug
export const Route = createFileRoute("/{-$locale}/blog/{-$category}/$slug")({
  beforeLoad: async ({ params }) => {
    const locale = params.locale || "en";
    const category = params.category;

    // Validate locale and category
    const validLocales = ["en", "fr", "es", "de"];
    if (locale && !validLocales.includes(locale)) {
      throw new Error("Invalid locale");
    }

    return { locale, category };
  },
  loader: async ({ params, context }) => {
    const { locale } = context;
    const { slug, category } = params;

    return fetchBlogPost({ slug, category, locale });
  },
  component: BlogPostComponent,
});

function BlogPostComponent() {
  const { locale, category, slug } = Route.useParams();
  const data = Route.useLoaderData();

  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>
      <p>
        Category: {category || "All"} | Language: {locale || "en"}
      </p>
      <div>{data.content}</div>
    </article>
  );
}
```

This supports URLs like:

- `/blog/tech/my-post` (default locale, tech category)
- `/fr/blog/my-post` (French, no category)
- `/en/blog/tech/my-post` (explicit English, tech category)
- `/es/blog/tecnologia/mi-post` (Spanish, Spanish category)

### Language Navigation

Create language switchers using optional i18n parameters with function-style params:

```tsx
function LanguageSwitcher() {
  const currentParams = useParams({ strict: false });

  const languages = [
    { code: "en", name: "English" },
    { code: "fr", name: "Français" },
    { code: "es", name: "Español" },
  ];

  return (
    <div className="language-switcher">
      {languages.map(({ code, name }) => (
        <Link
          key={code}
          to="/{-$locale}/blog/{-$category}/$slug"
          params={(prev) => ({
            ...prev,
            locale: code === "en" ? undefined : code, // Remove 'en' for clean URLs
          })}
          className={currentParams.locale === code ? "active" : ""}
        >
          {name}
        </Link>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

You can also create more sophisticated language switching logic:

```tsx
function AdvancedLanguageSwitcher() {
  const currentParams = useParams({ strict: false });

  const handleLanguageChange = (newLocale: string) => {
    return (prev: any) => {
      // Preserve all existing params but update locale
      const updatedParams = { ...prev };

      if (newLocale === "en") {
        // Remove locale for clean English URLs
        delete updatedParams.locale;
      } else {
        updatedParams.locale = newLocale;
      }

      return updatedParams;
    };
  };

  return (
    <div className="language-switcher">
      <Link to="/{-$locale}/blog/{-$category}/$slug" params={handleLanguageChange("fr")}>
        Français
      </Link>

      <Link to="/{-$locale}/blog/{-$category}/$slug" params={handleLanguageChange("es")}>
        Español
      </Link>

      <Link to="/{-$locale}/blog/{-$category}/$slug" params={handleLanguageChange("en")}>
        English
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Advanced i18n with Optional Parameters

Organize i18n routes using optional parameters for flexible locale handling:

```tsx
// Route structure:
// routes/
//   {-$locale}/
//     index.tsx        // /, /en, /fr
//     about.tsx        // /about, /en/about, /fr/about
//     blog/
//       index.tsx      // /blog, /en/blog, /fr/blog
//       $slug.tsx      // /blog/post, /en/blog/post, /fr/blog/post

// routes/{-$locale}/index.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/{-$locale}/")({
  component: HomeComponent,
});

function HomeComponent() {
  const { locale } = Route.useParams();
  const isRTL = ["ar", "he", "fa"].includes(locale || "");

  return (
    <div dir={isRTL ? "rtl" : "ltr"}>
      <h1>Welcome ({locale || "en"})</h1>
      {/* Localized content */}
    </div>
  );
}

// routes/{-$locale}/about.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/{-$locale}/about")({
  component: AboutComponent,
});
```

### SEO and Canonical URLs

Handle SEO for i18n routes properly:

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/{-$locale}/products/$id")({
  component: ProductComponent,
  head: ({ params, loaderData }) => {
    const locale = params.locale || "en";
    const product = loaderData;

    return {
      title: product.title[locale] || product.title.en,
      meta: [
        {
          name: "description",
          content: product.description[locale] || product.description.en,
        },
        {
          property: "og:locale",
          content: locale,
        },
      ],
      links: [
        // Canonical URL (always use default locale format)
        {
          rel: "canonical",
          href: `https://example.com/products/${params.id}`,
        },
        // Alternate language versions
        {
          rel: "alternate",
          hreflang: "en",
          href: `https://example.com/products/${params.id}`,
        },
        {
          rel: "alternate",
          hreflang: "fr",
          href: `https://example.com/fr/products/${params.id}`,
        },
        {
          rel: "alternate",
          hreflang: "es",
          href: `https://example.com/es/products/${params.id}`,
        },
      ],
    };
  },
});
```

### Type Safety for i18n

Ensure type safety for your i18n implementations:

```tsx
// Define supported locales
type Locale = "en" | "fr" | "es" | "de";

// Type-safe locale validation
function validateLocale(locale: string | undefined): locale is Locale {
  return ["en", "fr", "es", "de"].includes(locale as Locale);
}

export const Route = createFileRoute("/{-$locale}/shop/{-$category}")({
  beforeLoad: async ({ params }) => {
    const { locale } = params;

    // Type-safe locale validation
    if (locale && !validateLocale(locale)) {
      throw redirect({
        to: "/shop/{-$category}",
        params: { category: params.category },
      });
    }

    return {
      locale: (locale as Locale) || "en",
      isDefaultLocale: !locale || locale === "en",
    };
  },
  component: ShopComponent,
});

function ShopComponent() {
  const { locale, category } = Route.useParams();
  const { isDefaultLocale } = Route.useRouteContext();

  // TypeScript knows locale is Locale | undefined
  // and we have validated it in beforeLoad

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Shop {category ? `- ${category}` : ""}</h1>
      <p>Language: {locale || "en"}</p>
      {!isDefaultLocale && (
        <Link to="/shop/{-$category}" params={{ category }}>
          View in English
        </Link>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Optional path parameters provide a powerful and flexible foundation for implementing internationalization in your TanStack Router applications. Whether you prefer prefix-based or combined approaches, you can create clean, SEO-friendly URLs while maintaining excellent developer experience and type safety.

## Allowed Characters

By default, path params are escaped with `encodeURIComponent`. If you want to allow other valid URI characters (e.g. `@` or `+`), you can specify that in your [RouterOptions](../../api/router/RouterOptionsType.md#pathparamsallowedcharacters-property).

Example usage:

```tsx
const router = createRouter({
  // ...
  pathParamsAllowedCharacters: ["@"],
});
```

The following is the list of accepted allowed characters:

- `;`
- `:`
- `@`
- `&`
- `=`
- `+`
- `$`
- `,`

<file path="docs/react/guide/preloading.md">
---
title: Preloading
---

Preloading in TanStack Router is a way to load a route before the user actually navigates to it. This is useful for routes that are likely to be visited by the user next. For example, if you have a list of posts and the user is likely to click on one of them, you can preload the post route so that it's ready to go when the user clicks on it.

## Supported Preloading Strategies

- Intent
  - Preloading by **"intent"** works by using hover and touch start events on `<Link>` components to preload the dependencies for the destination route.
  - This strategy is useful for preloading routes that the user is likely to visit next.
- Viewport Visibility
  - Preloading by **"viewport**" works by using the Intersection Observer API to preload the dependencies for the destination route when the `<Link>` component is in the viewport.
  - This strategy is useful for preloading routes that are below the fold or off-screen.
- Render
  - Preloading by **"render"** works by preloading the dependencies for the destination route as soon as the `<Link>` component is rendered in the DOM.
  - This strategy is useful for preloading routes that are always needed.

## How long does preloaded data stay in memory?

Preloaded route matches are temporarily cached in memory with a few important caveats:

- **Unused preloaded data is removed after 30 seconds by default.** This can be configured by setting the `defaultPreloadMaxAge` option on your router.
- **Obviously, when a route is loaded, its preloaded version is promoted to the router's normal pending matches state.**

If you need more control over preloading, caching and/or garbage collection of preloaded data, you should use an external caching library like [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query).

The simplest way to preload routes for your application is to set the `defaultPreload` option to `intent` for your entire router:

```tsx
import { createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const router = createRouter({
  // ...
  defaultPreload: "intent",
});
```

This will turn on `intent` preloading by default for all `<Link>` components in your application. You can also set the `preload` prop on individual `<Link>` components to override the default behavior.

## Preload Delay

By default, preloading will start after **50ms** of the user hovering or touching a `<Link>` component. You can change this delay by setting the `defaultPreloadDelay` option on your router:

```tsx
import { createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const router = createRouter({
  // ...
  defaultPreloadDelay: 100,
});
```

You can also set the `preloadDelay` prop on individual `<Link>` components to override the default behavior on a per-link basis.

## Built-in Preloading & `preloadStaleTime`

If you're using the built-in loaders, you can control how long preloaded data is considered fresh until another preload is triggered by setting either `routerOptions.defaultPreloadStaleTime` or `routeOptions.preloadStaleTime` to a number of milliseconds. **By default, preloaded data is considered fresh for 30 seconds.**.

To change this, you can set the `defaultPreloadStaleTime` option on your router:

```tsx
import { createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const router = createRouter({
  // ...
  defaultPreloadStaleTime: 10_000,
});
```

Or, you can use the `routeOptions.preloadStaleTime` option on individual routes:

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.$postId.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  loader: async ({ params }) => fetchPost(params.postId),
  // Preload the route again if the preload cache is older than 10 seconds
  preloadStaleTime: 10_000,
});
```

## Preloading with External Libraries

When integrating external caching libraries like React Query, which have their own mechanisms for determining stale data, you may want to override the default preloading and stale-while-revalidate logic of TanStack Router. These libraries often use options like staleTime to control the freshness of data.

To customize the preloading behavior in TanStack Router and fully leverage your external library's caching strategy, you can bypass the built-in caching by setting routerOptions.defaultPreloadStaleTime or routeOptions.preloadStaleTime to 0. This ensures that all preloads are marked as stale internally, and loaders are always invoked, allowing your external library, such as React Query, to manage data loading and caching.

For example:

```tsx
import { createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const router = createRouter({
  // ...
  defaultPreloadStaleTime: 0,
});
```

This would then allow you, for instance, to use an option like React Query's `staleTime` to control the freshness of your preloads.

## Preloading Manually

If you need to manually preload a route, you can use the router's `preloadRoute` method. It accepts a standard TanStack `NavigateOptions` object and returns a promise that resolves when the route is preloaded.

```tsx
function Component() {
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    async function preload() {
      try {
        const matches = await router.preloadRoute({
          to: postRoute,
          params: { id: 1 },
        });
      } catch (err) {
        // Failed to preload route
      }
    }

    preload();
  }, [router]);

  return <div />;
}
```

If you need to preload only the JS chunk of a route, you can use the router's `loadRouteChunk` method. It accepts a route object and returns a promise that resolves when the route chunk is loaded.

```tsx
function Component() {
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    async function preloadRouteChunks() {
      try {
        const postsRoute = router.routesByPath["/posts"];
        await Promise.all([
          router.loadRouteChunk(router.routesByPath["/"]),
          router.loadRouteChunk(postsRoute),
          router.loadRouteChunk(postsRoute.parentRoute),
        ]);
      } catch (err) {
        // Failed to preload route chunk
      }
    }

    preloadRouteChunks();
  }, [router]);

  return <div />;
}
```
</file>

<file path="docs/react/guide/render-optimizations.md">
---
title: Render Optimizations
---

TanStack Router includes several optimizations to ensure your components only re-render when necessary. These optimizations include:

## structural sharing

TanStack Router uses a technique called "structural sharing" to preserve as many references as possible between re-renders, which is particularly useful for state stored in the URL, such as search parameters.

For example, consider a `details` route with two search parameters, `foo` and `bar`, accessed like this:

```tsx
const search = Route.useSearch();
```

When only `bar` is changed by navigating from `/details?foo=f1&bar=b1` to `/details?foo=f1&bar=b2`, `search.foo` will be referentially stable and only `search.bar` will be replaced.

## fine-grained selectors

You can access and subscribe to the router state using various hooks like `useRouterState`, `useSearch`, and others. If you only want a specific component to re-render when a particular subset of the router state such as a subset of the search parameters changes, you can use partial subscriptions with the `select` property.

```tsx
// component won't re-render when `bar` changes
const foo = Route.useSearch({ select: ({ foo }) => foo });
```

### structural sharing with fine-grained selectors

The `select` function can perform various calculations on the router state, allowing you to return different types of values, such as objects. For example:

```tsx
const result = Route.useSearch({
  select: (search) => {
    return {
      foo: search.foo,
      hello: `hello ${search.foo}`,
    };
  },
});
```

Although this works, it will cause your component to re-render each time, since `select` is now returning a new object each time it’s called.

You can avoid this re-rendering issue by using "structural sharing" as described above. By default, structural sharing is turned off to maintain backward compatibility, but this may change in v2.

To enable structural sharing for fine grained selectors, you have two options:

#### Enable it by default in the router options:

```tsx
const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
  defaultStructuralSharing: true,
});
```

#### Enable it per hook usage as shown here:

```tsx
const result = Route.useSearch({
  select: (search) => {
    return {
      foo: search.foo,
      hello: `hello ${search.foo}`,
    };
  },
  structuralSharing: true,
});
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Structural sharing only works with JSON-compatible data. This means you cannot use `select` to return items like class instances if structural sharing is enabled.

In line with TanStack Router's type-safe design, TypeScript will raise an error if you attempt the following:

```tsx
const result = Route.useSearch({
  select: (search) => {
    return {
      date: new Date(),
    };
  },
  structuralSharing: true,
});
```

If structural sharing is enabled by default in the router options, you can prevent this error by setting `structuralSharing: false`.

<file path="docs/react/guide/route-masking.md">
---
title: Route Masking
---

Route masking is a way to mask the actual URL of a route that gets persisted to the browser's history and URL bar. This is useful for scenarios where you want to show a different URL than the one that is actually being navigated to and then falling back to the displayed URL when it is shared and (optionally) when the page is reloaded. Here's a few examples:

- Navigating to a modal route like `/photo/5/modal`, but masking the actual URL as `/photos/5`
- Navigating to a modal route like `/post/5/comments`, but masking the actual URL as `/posts/5`
- Navigating to a route with the search param `?showLogin=true`, but masking the URL to _not_ contain the search param
- Navigating to a route with the search param `?modal=settings`, but masking the URL as `/settings'

Each of these scenarios can be achieved with route masking and even extended to support more advanced patterns like [parallel routes](../parallel-routes.md).

## How does route masking work?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You **do not** need to understand how route masking works in order to use it. This section is for those who are curious about how it works under the hood. Skip to [How do I use route masking?](#how-do-i-use-route-masking) to learn how to use it!.

Route masking utilizes the `location.state` API to store the desired runtime location inside of the location that will get written to the URL. It stores this runtime location under the `__tempLocation` state property:

```tsx
const location = {
  pathname: "/photos/5",
  search: "",
  hash: "",
  state: {
    key: "wesdfs",
    __tempKey: "sadfasd",
    __tempLocation: {
      pathname: "/photo/5/modal",
      search: "",
      hash: "",
      state: {},
    },
  },
};
```

When the router parses a location from history with the `location.state.__tempLocation` property, it will use that location instead of the one that was parsed from the URL. This allows you to navigate to a route like `/photos/5` and have the router actually navigate to `/photo/5/modal` instead. When this happens, the history location is saved back into the `location.maskedLocation` property, just in case we need to know what the **actual URL** is. One example of where this is used is in the Devtools where we detect if a route is masked and show the actual URL instead of the masked one!

Remember, you don't need to worry about any of this. It's all handled for you automatically under the hood!

## How do I use route masking?

Route masking is a simple API that can be used in 2 ways:

- Imperatively via the `mask` option available on the `<Link>` and `navigate()` APIs
- Declaratively via the Router's `routeMasks` option

When using either route masking APIs, the `mask` option accepts the same navigation object that the `<Link>` and `navigate()` APIs accept. This means you can use the same `to`, `replace`, `state`, and `search` options that you're already familiar with. The only difference is that the `mask` option will be used to mask the URL of the route being navigated to.

> 🧠 The mask option is also **type-safe**! This means that if you're using TypeScript, you'll get type errors if you try to pass an invalid navigation object to the `mask` option. Booyah!

### Imperative route masking

The `<Link>` and `navigate()` APIs both accept a `mask` option that can be used to mask the URL of the route being navigated to. Here's an example of using it with the `<Link>` component:

```tsx
<Link
  to="/photos/$photoId/modal"
  params={{ photoId: 5 }}
  mask={{
    to: "/photos/$photoId",
    params: {
      photoId: 5,
    },
  }}
>
  Open Photo
</Link>
```

And here's an example of using it with the `navigate()` API:

```tsx
const navigate = useNavigate();

function onOpenPhoto() {
  navigate({
    to: "/photos/$photoId/modal",
    params: { photoId: 5 },
    mask: {
      to: "/photos/$photoId",
      params: {
        photoId: 5,
      },
    },
  });
}
```

### Declarative route masking

In addition to the imperative API, you can also use the Router's `routeMasks` option to declaratively mask routes. Instead of needing to pass the `mask` option to every `<Link>` or `navigate()` call, you can instead create a route mask on the Router to mask routes that match a certain pattern. Here's an example of the same route mask from above, but using the `routeMasks` option instead:

// Use the following for the example below

```tsx
import { createRouteMask } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const photoModalToPhotoMask = createRouteMask({
  routeTree,
  from: "/photos/$photoId/modal",
  to: "/photos/$photoId",
  params: (prev) => ({
    photoId: prev.photoId,
  }),
});

const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
  routeMasks: [photoModalToPhotoMask],
});
```

When creating a route mask, you'll need to pass 1 argument with at least:

- `routeTree` - The route tree that the route mask will be applied to
- `from` - The route ID that the route mask will be applied to
- `...navigateOptions` - The standard `to`, `search`, `params`, `replace`, etc options that the `<Link>` and `navigate()` APIs accept

> 🧠 The `createRouteMask` option is also **type-safe**! This means that if you're using TypeScript, you'll get type errors if you try to pass an invalid route mask to the `routeMasks` option.

## Unmasking when sharing the URL

URLs are automatically unmasked when they are shared since as soon as a URL is detached from your browsers local history stack, the URL masking data is no longer available. Essentially, as soon as you copy and paste a URL out of your history, its masking data is lost... after all, that's the point of masking a URL!

## Local Unmasking Defaults

**By default, URLs are not unmasked when the page is reloaded locally**. Masking data is stored in the `location.state` property of the history location, so as long as the history location is still in memory in your history stack, the masking data will be available and the URL will continue to be masked.

## Unmasking on page reload

**As stated above, URLs are not unmasked when the page is reloaded by default**.

If you want to unmask a URL locally when the page is reloaded, you have 3 options, each overriding the previous one in priority if passed:

- Set the Router's default `unmaskOnReload` option to `true`
- Return the `unmaskOnReload: true` option from the masking function when creating a route mask with `createRouteMask()`
- Pass the `unmaskOnReload: true` option to the `<Link`> component or `navigate()` API

title: Router Context
---

TanStack Router's router context is a very powerful tool that can be used for dependency injection among many other things. Aptly named, the router context is passed through the router and down through each matching route. At each route in the hierarchy, the context can be modified or added to. Here's a few ways you might use the router context practically:

- Dependency Injection
  - You can supply dependencies (e.g. a loader function, a data fetching client, a mutation service) which the route and all child routes can access and use without importing or creating directly.
- Breadcrumbs
  - While the main context object for each route is merged as it descends, each route's unique context is also stored making it possible to attach breadcrumbs or methods to each route's context.
- Dynamic meta tag management
  - You can attach meta tags to each route's context and then use a meta tag manager to dynamically update the meta tags on the page as the user navigates the site.

These are just suggested uses of the router context. You can use it for whatever you want!

## Typed Router Context

Like everything else, the root router context is strictly typed. This type can be augmented via any route's `beforeLoad` option as it is merged down the route match tree. To constrain the type of the root router context, you must use the `createRootRouteWithContext<YourContextTypeHere>()(routeOptions)` function to create a new router context instead of the `createRootRoute()` function to create your root route. Here's an example:

```tsx
import { createRootRouteWithContext, createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

interface MyRouterContext {
  user: User;
}

// Use the routerContext to create your root route
const rootRoute = createRootRouteWithContext<MyRouterContext>()({
  component: App,
});

const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([
  // ...
]);

// Use the routerContext to create your router
const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
});
```

## Passing the initial Router Context

The router context is passed to the router at instantiation time. You can pass the initial router context to the router via the `context` option:

> [!TIP]
> If your context has any required properties, you will see a TypeScript error if you don't pass them in the initial router context. If all of your context properties are optional, you will not see a TypeScript error and passing the context will be optional. If you don't pass a router context, it defaults to `{}`.

```tsx
import { createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

// Use the routerContext you created to create your router
const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
  context: {
    user: {
      id: "123",
      name: "John Doe",
    },
  },
});
```

### Invalidating the Router Context

If you need to invalidate the context state you are passing into the router, you can call the `invalidate` method to tell the router to recompute the context. This is useful when you need to update the context state and have the router recompute the context for all routes.

```tsx
function useAuth() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = auth.onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
      setUser(user);
      router.invalidate();
    });

    return unsubscribe;
  }, []);

  return user;
}
```

## Using the Router Context

Once you have defined the router context type, you can use it in your route definitions:

```tsx
// src/routes/todos.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/todos")({
  component: Todos,
  loader: ({ context }) => fetchTodosByUserId(context.user.id),
});
```

You can even inject data fetching and mutation implementations themselves! In fact, this is highly recommended 😜

Let's try this with a simple function to fetch some todos:

```tsx
const fetchTodosByUserId = async ({ userId }) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/todos?userId=${userId}`);
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
};

const router = createRouter({
  routeTree: rootRoute,
  context: {
    userId: "123",
    fetchTodosByUserId,
  },
});
```

Then, in your route:

```tsx
// src/routes/todos.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/todos")({
  component: Todos,
  loader: ({ context }) => context.fetchTodosByUserId(context.userId),
});
```

### How about an external data fetching library?

```tsx
import { createRootRouteWithContext, createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

interface MyRouterContext {
  queryClient: QueryClient;
}

const rootRoute = createRootRouteWithContext<MyRouterContext>()({
  component: App,
});

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

const router = createRouter({
  routeTree: rootRoute,
  context: {
    queryClient,
  },
});
```

Then, in your route:

```tsx
// src/routes/todos.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/todos")({
  component: Todos,
  loader: async ({ context }) => {
    await context.queryClient.ensureQueryData({
      queryKey: ["todos", { userId: user.id }],
      queryFn: fetchTodos,
    });
  },
});
```

## How about using React Context/Hooks?

When trying to use React Context or Hooks in your route's `beforeLoad` or `loader` functions, it's important to remember React's [Rules of Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks). You can't use hooks in a non-React function, so you can't use hooks in your `beforeLoad` or `loader` functions.

So, how do we use React Context or Hooks in our route's `beforeLoad` or `loader` functions? We can use the router context to pass down the React Context or Hooks to our route's `beforeLoad` or `loader` functions.

Let's look at the setup for an example, where we pass down a `useNetworkStrength` hook to our route's `loader` function:

- `src/routes/__root.tsx`

```tsx
// First, make sure the context for the root route is typed
import { createRootRouteWithContext } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { useNetworkStrength } from "@/hooks/useNetworkStrength";

interface MyRouterContext {
  networkStrength: ReturnType<typeof useNetworkStrength>;
}

export const Route = createRootRouteWithContext<MyRouterContext>()({
  component: App,
});
```

In this example, we'd instantiate the hook before rendering the router using the `<RouterProvider />`. This way, the hook would be called in React-land, therefore adhering to the Rules of Hooks.

- `src/router.tsx`

```tsx
import { createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

export const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
  context: {
    networkStrength: undefined!, // We'll set this in React-land
  },
});
```

- `src/main.tsx`

```tsx
import { RouterProvider } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { router } from "./router";

import { useNetworkStrength } from "@/hooks/useNetworkStrength";

function App() {
  const networkStrength = useNetworkStrength();
  // Inject the returned value from the hook into the router context
  return <RouterProvider router={router} context={{ networkStrength }} />;
}

// ...
```

So, now in our route's `loader` function, we can access the `networkStrength` hook from the router context:

- `src/routes/posts.tsx`

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  component: Posts,
  loader: ({ context }) => {
    if (context.networkStrength === "STRONG") {
      // Do something
    }
  },
});
```

## Modifying the Router Context

The router context is passed down the route tree and is merged at each route. This means that you can modify the context at each route and the modifications will be available to all child routes. Here's an example:

- `src/routes/__root.tsx`

```tsx
import { createRootRouteWithContext } from "@tanstack/react-router";

interface MyRouterContext {
  foo: boolean;
}

export const Route = createRootRouteWithContext<MyRouterContext>()({
  component: App,
});
```

- `src/router.tsx`

```tsx
import { createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
  context: {
    foo: true,
  },
});
```

- `src/routes/todos.tsx`

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/todos")({
  component: Todos,
  beforeLoad: () => {
    return {
      bar: true,
    };
  },
  loader: ({ context }) => {
    context.foo; // true
    context.bar; // true
  },
});
```

## Processing Accumulated Route Context

Context, especially the isolated route `context` objects, make it trivial to accumulate and process the route context objects for all matched routes. Here's an example where we use all of the matched route contexts to generate a breadcrumb trail:

```tsx
// src/routes/__root.tsx
export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => {
    const matches = useRouterState({ select: (s) => s.matches });

    const breadcrumbs = matches
      .filter((match) => match.context.getTitle)
      .map(({ pathname, context }) => {
        return {
          title: context.getTitle(),
          path: pathname,
        };
      });

    // ...
  },
});
```

Using that same route context, we could also generate a title tag for our page's `<head>`:

```tsx
// src/routes/__root.tsx
export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => {
    const matches = useRouterState({ select: (s) => s.matches });

    const matchWithTitle = [...matches].reverse().find((d) => d.context.getTitle);

    const title = matchWithTitle?.context.getTitle() || "My App";

    return (
      <html>
        <head>
          <title>{title}</title>
        </head>
        <body>{/* ... */}</body>
      </html>
    );
  },
});
```

## Hash/Top-of-Page Scrolling

Out of the box, TanStack Router supports both **hash scrolling** and **top-of-page scrolling** without any additional configuration.

## Scroll-to-top & Nested Scrollable Areas

By default, scroll-to-top mimics the behavior of the browser, which means only the `window` itself is scrolled to the top after successful navigation. For many apps however, it's common for the main scrollable area to be a nested div or similar because of advanced layouts. If you would like TanStack Router to also scroll these main scrollable areas for you, you can add selectors to target them using the `routerOptions.scrollToTopSelectors`:

```tsx
const router = createRouter({
  scrollToTopSelectors: ["#main-scrollable-area"],
});
```

For complex selectors that cannot be simply resolved using `document.querySelector(selector)`, you can pass functions that return HTML elements to `routerOptions.scrollToTopSelectors`:

```tsx
const selector = () =>
  document
    .querySelector("#shadowRootParent")
    ?.shadowRoot?.querySelector("#main-scrollable-area");

const router = createRouter({
  scrollToTopSelectors: [selector],
});
```

These selectors are handled **in addition to `window`** which cannot be disabled currently.

## Scroll Restoration

Scroll restoration is the process of restoring the scroll position of a page when the user navigates back to it. This is normally a built-in feature for standard HTML based websites, but can be difficult to replicate for SPA applications because:

- SPAs typically use the `history.pushState` API for navigation, so the browser doesn't know to restore the scroll position natively
- SPAs sometimes render content asynchronously, so the browser doesn't know the height of the page until after it's rendered
- SPAs can sometimes use nested scrollable containers to force specific layouts and features.

Not only that, but it's very common for applications to have multiple scrollable areas within an app, not just the body. For example, a chat application might have a scrollable sidebar and a scrollable chat area. In this case, you would want to restore the scroll position of both areas independently.

To alleviate this problem, TanStack Router provides a scroll restoration component and hook that handle the process of monitoring, caching and restoring scroll positions for you.

It does this by:

- Monitoring the DOM for scroll events
- Registering scrollable areas with the scroll restoration cache
- Listening to the proper router events to know when to cache and restore scroll positions
- Storing scroll positions for each scrollable area in the cache (including `window` and `body`)
- Restoring scroll positions after successful navigations before DOM paint

That may sound like a lot, but for you, it's as simple as this:

```tsx
import { createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const router = createRouter({
  scrollRestoration: true,
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `<ScrollRestoration />` component still works, but has been deprecated.

## Custom Cache Keys

Falling in behind Remix's own Scroll Restoration APIs, you can also customize the key used to cache scroll positions for a given scrollable area using the `getKey` option. This could be used, for example, to force the same scroll position to be used regardless of the users browser history.

The `getKey` option receives the relevant `Location` state from TanStack Router and expects you to return a string to uniquely identify the scrollable measurements for that state.

The default `getKey` is `(location) => location.state.__TSR_key!`, where `__TSR_key` is the unique key generated for each entry in the history.

> Older versions, prior to `v1.121.34`, used `state.key` as the default key, but this has been deprecated in favor of `state.__TSR_key`. For now, `location.state.key` will still be available for compatibility, but it will be removed in the next major version.

## Examples

You could sync scrolling to the pathname:

```tsx
import { createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const router = createRouter({
  getScrollRestorationKey: (location) => location.pathname,
});
```

You can conditionally sync only some paths, then use the key for the rest:

```tsx
import { createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const router = createRouter({
  getScrollRestorationKey: (location) => {
    const paths = ["/", "/chat"];
    return paths.includes(location.pathname)
      ? location.pathname
      : location.state.__TSR_key!;
  },
});
```

## Preventing Scroll Restoration

Sometimes you may want to prevent scroll restoration from happening. To do this you can utilize the `resetScroll` option available on the following APIs:

- `<Link resetScroll={false}>`
- `navigate({ resetScroll: false })`
- `redirect({ resetScroll: false })`

When `resetScroll` is set to `false`, the scroll position for the next navigation will not be restored (if navigating to an existing history event in the stack) or reset to the top (if it's a new history event in the stack).

## Manual Scroll Restoration

Most of the time, you won't need to do anything special to get scroll restoration to work. However, there are some cases where you may need to manually control scroll restoration. The most common example is **virtualized lists**.

To manually control scroll restoration for virtualized lists within the whole browser window:

[//]: # "VirtualizedWindowScrollRestorationExample"

```tsx
function Component() {
  const scrollEntry = useElementScrollRestoration({
    getElement: () => window,
  })

  // Let's use TanStack Virtual to virtualize some content!
  const virtualizer = useWindowVirtualizer({
    count: 10000,
    estimateSize: () => 100,
    // We pass the scrollY from the scroll restoration entry to the virtualizer
    // as the initial offset
    initialOffset: scrollEntry?.scrollY,
  })

  return (
    <div>
      {virtualizer.getVirtualItems().map(item => (
        ...
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

[//]: # "VirtualizedWindowScrollRestorationExample"

To manually control scroll restoration for a specific element, you can use the `useElementScrollRestoration` hook and the `data-scroll-restoration-id` DOM attribute:

[//]: # "ManualRestorationExample"

```tsx
function Component() {
  // We need a unique ID for manual scroll restoration on a specific element
  // It should be as unique as possible for this element across your app
  const scrollRestorationId = "myVirtualizedContent";

  // We use that ID to get the scroll entry for this element
  const scrollEntry = useElementScrollRestoration({
    id: scrollRestorationId,
  });

  // Let's use TanStack Virtual to virtualize some content!
  const virtualizerParentRef = React.useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const virtualizer = useVirtualizer({
    count: 10000,
    getScrollElement: () => virtualizerParentRef.current,
    estimateSize: () => 100,
    // We pass the scrollY from the scroll restoration entry to the virtualizer
    // as the initial offset
    initialOffset: scrollEntry?.scrollY,
  });

  return (
    <div
      ref={virtualizerParentRef}
      // We pass the scroll restoration ID to the element
      // as a custom attribute that will get picked up by the
      // scroll restoration watcher
      data-scroll-restoration-id={scrollRestorationId}
      className="relative flex-1 overflow-auto rounded-lg border"
    >
      ...
    </div>
  );
}
```

[//]: # "ManualRestorationExample"

## Scroll Behavior

To control the scroll behavior when navigating between pages, you can use the `scrollRestorationBehavior` option. This allows you to make the transition between pages instant instead of a smooth scroll. The global configuration of scroll restoration behavior has the same options as those supported by the browser, which are `smooth`, `instant`, and `auto` (see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView#behavior) for more information).

```tsx
import { createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const router = createRouter({
  scrollRestorationBehavior: "instant",
});
```

<file path="docs/react/guide/search-params.md">

title: Search Params
---

Similar to how TanStack Query made handling server-state in your React and Solid applications a breeze, TanStack Router aims to unlock the power of URL search params in your applications.

> 🧠 If you are on a really old browser, like IE11, you may need to use a polyfill for `URLSearchParams`.

## Why not just use `URLSearchParams`?

We get it, you've been hearing a lot of "use the platform" lately and for the most part, we agree. However, we also believe it's important to recognize where the platform falls short for more advanced use-cases and we believe `URLSearchParams` is one of these circumstances.

Traditional Search Param APIs usually assume a few things:

- Search params are always strings
- They are _mostly_ flat
- Serializing and deserializing using `URLSearchParams` is good enough (Spoiler alert: it's not.)
- Search params modifications are tightly coupled with the URL's pathname and must be updated together, even if the pathname is not changing.

Reality is very different from these assumptions though.

- Search params represent application state, so inevitably, we will expect them to have the same DX associated with other state managers. This means having the capability of distinguishing between primitive value types and efficiently storing and manipulating complex data structures like nested arrays and objects.
- There are many ways to serialize and deserialize state with different tradeoffs. You should be able to choose the best one for your application or at the very least get a better default than `URLSearchParams`.
- Immutability & Structural Sharing. Every time you stringify and parse url search params, referential integrity and object identity is lost because each new parse creates a brand new data structure with a unique memory reference. If not properly managed over its lifetime, this constant serialization and parsing can result in unexpected and undesirable performance issues, especially in frameworks like React that choose to track reactivity via immutability or in Solid that normally relies on reconciliation to detect changes from deserialized data sources.
- Search params, while an important part of the URL, do frequently change independently of the URL's pathname. For example, a user may want to change the page number of a paginated list without touching the URL's pathname.

## Search Params, the "OG" State Manager

You've probably seen search params like `?page=3` or `?filter-name=tanner` in the URL. There is no question that this is truly **a form of global state** living inside of the URL. It's valuable to store specific pieces of state in the URL because:

- Users should be able to:
  - Cmd/Ctrl + Click to open a link in a new tab and reliably see the state they expected
  - Bookmark and share links from your application with others with assurances that they will see exactly the state as when the link was copied.
  - Refresh your app or navigate back and forth between pages without losing their state
- Developers should be able to easily:
  - Add, remove or modify state in the URL with the same great DX as other state managers
  - Easily validate search params coming from the URL in a format and type that is safe for their application to consume
  - Read and write to search params without having to worry about the underlying serialization format

## JSON-first Search Params

To achieve the above, the first step built in to TanStack Router is a powerful search param parser that automatically converts the search string of your URL to structured JSON. This means that you can store any JSON-serializable data structure in your search params and it will be parsed and serialized as JSON. This is a huge improvement over `URLSearchParams` which has limited support for array-like structures and nested data.

For example, navigating to the following route:

```tsx
const link = (
  <Link
    to="/shop"
    search={{
      pageIndex: 3,
      includeCategories: ["electronics", "gifts"],
      sortBy: "price",
      desc: true,
    }}
  />
);
```

Will result in the following URL:

```
/shop?pageIndex=3&includeCategories=%5B%22electronics%22%2C%22gifts%22%5D&sortBy=price&desc=true
```

When this URL is parsed, the search params will be accurately converted back to the following JSON:

```json
{
  "pageIndex": 3,
  "includeCategories": ["electronics", "gifts"],
  "sortBy": "price",
  "desc": true
}
```

If you noticed, there are a few things going on here:

- The first level of the search params is flat and string based, just like `URLSearchParams`.
- First level values that are not strings are accurately preserved as actual numbers and booleans.
- Nested data structures are automatically converted to URL-safe JSON strings

> 🧠 It's common for other tools to assume that search params are always flat and string-based which is why we've chosen to keep things URLSearchParam compliant at the first level. This ultimately means that even though TanStack Router is managing your nested search params as JSON, other tools will still be able to write to the URL and read first-level params normally.

## Validating and Typing Search Params

Despite TanStack Router being able to parse search params into reliable JSON, they ultimately still came from **a user-facing raw-text input**. Similar to other serialization boundaries, this means that before you consume search params, they should be validated into a format that your application can trust and rely on.

### Enter Validation + TypeScript!

TanStack Router provides convenient APIs for validating and typing search params. This all starts with the `Route`'s `validateSearch` option:

```tsx
// /routes/shop.products.tsx

type ProductSearchSortOptions = "newest" | "oldest" | "price";

type ProductSearch = {
  page: number;
  filter: string;
  sort: ProductSearchSortOptions;
};

export const Route = createFileRoute("/shop/products")({
  validateSearch: (search: Record<string, unknown>): ProductSearch => {
    // validate and parse the search params into a typed state
    return {
      page: Number(search?.page ?? 1),
      filter: (search.filter as string) || "",
      sort: (search.sort as ProductSearchSortOptions) || "newest",
    };
  },
});
```

In the above example, we're validating the search params of the `Route` and returning a typed `ProductSearch` object. This typed object is then made available to this route's other options **and any child routes, too!**

### Validating Search Params

The `validateSearch` option is a function that is provided the JSON parsed (but non-validated) search params as a `Record<string, unknown>` and returns a typed object of your choice. It's usually best to provide sensible fallbacks for malformed or unexpected search params so your users' experience stays non-interrupted.

Here's an example:

```tsx
// /routes/shop.products.tsx

type ProductSearchSortOptions = "newest" | "oldest" | "price";

type ProductSearch = {
  page: number;
  filter: string;
  sort: ProductSearchSortOptions;
};

export const Route = createFileRoute("/shop/products")({
  validateSearch: (search: Record<string, unknown>): ProductSearch => {
    // validate and parse the search params into a typed state
    return {
      page: Number(search?.page ?? 1),
      filter: (search.filter as string) || "",
      sort: (search.sort as ProductSearchSortOptions) || "newest",
    };
  },
});
```

Here's an example using the [Zod](https://zod.dev/) library (but feel free to use any validation library you want) to both validate and type the search params in a single step:

```tsx
// /routes/shop.products.tsx

import { z } from "zod";

const productSearchSchema = z.object({
  page: z.number().catch(1),
  filter: z.string().catch(""),
  sort: z.enum(["newest", "oldest", "price"]).catch("newest"),
});

type ProductSearch = z.infer<typeof productSearchSchema>;

export const Route = createFileRoute("/shop/products")({
  validateSearch: (search) => productSearchSchema.parse(search),
});
```

Because `validateSearch` also accepts an object with the `parse` property, this can be shortened to:

```tsx
validateSearch: productSearchSchema;
```

In the above example, we used Zod's `.catch()` modifier instead of `.default()` to avoid showing an error to the user because we firmly believe that if a search parameter is malformed, you probably don't want to halt the user's experience through the app to show a big fat error message. That said, there may be times that you **do want to show an error message**. In that case, you can use `.default()` instead of `.catch()`.

The underlying mechanics why this works relies on the `validateSearch` function throwing an error. If an error is thrown, the route's `onError` option will be triggered (and `error.routerCode` will be set to `VALIDATE_SEARCH` and the `errorComponent` will be rendered instead of the route's `component` where you can handle the search param error however you'd like.

#### Adapters

When using a library like [Zod](https://zod.dev/) to validate search params you might want to `transform` search params before committing the search params to the URL. A common `zod` `transform` is `default` for example.

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { z } from "zod";

const productSearchSchema = z.object({
  page: z.number().default(1),
  filter: z.string().default(""),
  sort: z.enum(["newest", "oldest", "price"]).default("newest"),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/shop/products/")({
  validateSearch: productSearchSchema,
});
```

It might be surprising that when you try to navigate to this route, `search` is required. The following `Link` will type error as `search` is missing.

```tsx
<Link to="/shop/products" />
```

For validation libraries we recommend using adapters which infer the correct `input` and `output` types.

### Zod

An adapter is provided for [Zod](https://zod.dev/) which will pipe through the correct `input` type and `output` type

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { zodValidator } from "@tanstack/zod-adapter";
import { z } from "zod";

const productSearchSchema = z.object({
  page: z.number().default(1),
  filter: z.string().default(""),
  sort: z.enum(["newest", "oldest", "price"]).default("newest"),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/shop/products/")({
  validateSearch: zodValidator(productSearchSchema),
});
```

The important part here is the following use of `Link` no longer requires `search` params

```tsx
<Link to="/shop/products" />
```

However the use of `catch` here overrides the types and makes `page`, `filter` and `sort` `unknown` causing type loss. We have handled this case by providing a `fallback` generic function which retains the types but provides a `fallback` value when validation fails

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { fallback, zodValidator } from "@tanstack/zod-adapter";
import { z } from "zod";

const productSearchSchema = z.object({
  page: fallback(z.number(), 1).default(1),
  filter: fallback(z.string(), "").default(""),
  sort: fallback(z.enum(["newest", "oldest", "price"]), "newest").default("newest"),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/shop/products/")({
  validateSearch: zodValidator(productSearchSchema),
});
```

Therefore when navigating to this route, `search` is optional and retains the correct types.

While not recommended, it is also possible to configure `input` and `output` type in case the `output` type is more accurate than the `input` type

```tsx
const productSearchSchema = z.object({
  page: fallback(z.number(), 1).default(1),
  filter: fallback(z.string(), "").default(""),
  sort: fallback(z.enum(["newest", "oldest", "price"]), "newest").default("newest"),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/shop/products/")({
  validateSearch: zodValidator({
    schema: productSearchSchema,
    input: "output",
    output: "input",
  }),
});
```

This provides flexibility in which type you want to infer for navigation and which types you want to infer for reading search params.

### Valibot

> [!WARNING]
> Router expects the valibot 1.0 package to be installed.

When using [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/) an adapter is not needed to ensure the correct `input` and `output` types are used for navigation and reading search params. This is because `valibot` implements [Standard Schema](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema)

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import * as v from "valibot";

const productSearchSchema = v.object({
  page: v.optional(v.fallback(v.number(), 1), 1),
  filter: v.optional(v.fallback(v.string(), ""), ""),
  sort: v.optional(
    v.fallback(v.picklist(["newest", "oldest", "price"]), "newest"),
    "newest",
  ),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/shop/products/")({
  validateSearch: productSearchSchema,
});
```

### Arktype

> [!WARNING]
> Router expects the arktype 2.0-rc package to be installed.

When using [ArkType](https://arktype.io/) an adapter is not needed to ensure the correct `input` and `output` types are used for navigation and reading search params. This is because [ArkType](https://arktype.io/) implements [Standard Schema](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema)

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { type } from "arktype";

const productSearchSchema = type({
  page: "number = 1",
  filter: 'string = ""',
  sort: '"newest" | "oldest" | "price" = "newest"',
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/shop/products/")({
  validateSearch: productSearchSchema,
});
```

### Effect/Schema

When using [Effect/Schema](https://effect.website/docs/schema/introduction/) an adapter is not needed to ensure the correct `input` and `output` types are used for navigation and reading search params. This is because [Effect/Schema](https://effect.website/docs/schema/standard-schema/) implements [Standard Schema](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema)

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { Schema as S } from "effect";

const productSearchSchema = S.standardSchemaV1(
  S.Struct({
    page: S.NumberFromString.pipe(
      S.optional,
      S.withDefaults({
        constructor: () => 1,
        decoding: () => 1,
      }),
    ),
    filter: S.String.pipe(
      S.optional,
      S.withDefaults({
        constructor: () => "",
        decoding: () => "",
      }),
    ),
    sort: S.Literal("newest", "oldest", "price").pipe(
      S.optional,
      S.withDefaults({
        constructor: () => "newest" as const,
        decoding: () => "newest" as const,
      }),
    ),
  }),
);

export const Route = createFileRoute("/shop/products/")({
  validateSearch: productSearchSchema,
});
```

## Reading Search Params

Once your search params have been validated and typed, you're finally ready to start reading and writing to them. There are a few ways to do this in TanStack Router, so let's check them out.

### Using Search Params in Loaders

Please read the [Search Params in Loaders](../data-loading.md#using-loaderdeps-to-access-search-params) section for more information about how to read search params in loaders with the `loaderDeps` option.

### Search Params are inherited from Parent Routes

The search parameters and types of parents are merged as you go down the route tree, so child routes also have access to their parent's search params:

- `shop.products.tsx`

```tsx
const productSearchSchema = z.object({
  page: z.number().catch(1),
  filter: z.string().catch(""),
  sort: z.enum(["newest", "oldest", "price"]).catch("newest"),
});

type ProductSearch = z.infer<typeof productSearchSchema>;

export const Route = createFileRoute("/shop/products")({
  validateSearch: productSearchSchema,
});
```

- `shop.products.$productId.tsx`

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/shop/products/$productId")({
  beforeLoad: ({ search }) => {
    search;
    // ^? ProductSearch ✅
  },
});
```

### Search Params in Components

You can access your route's validated search params in your route's `component` via the `useSearch` hook.

```tsx
// /routes/shop.products.tsx

export const Route = createFileRoute("/shop/products")({
  validateSearch: productSearchSchema,
});

const ProductList = () => {
  const { page, filter, sort } = Route.useSearch();

  return <div>...</div>;
};
```

> [!TIP]
> If your component is code-split, you can use the [getRouteApi function](../code-splitting.md#manually-accessing-route-apis-in-other-files-with-the-getrouteapi-helper) to avoid having to import the `Route` configuration to get access to the typed `useSearch()` hook.

### Search Params outside of Route Components

You can access your route's validated search params anywhere in your app using the `useSearch` hook. By passing the `from` id/path of your origin route, you'll get even better type safety:

```tsx
// /routes/shop.products.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/shop/products")({
  validateSearch: productSearchSchema,
  // ...
});

// Somewhere else...

// /components/product-list-sidebar.tsx
const routeApi = getRouteApi("/shop/products");

const ProductList = () => {
  const routeSearch = routeApi.useSearch();

  // OR

  const { page, filter, sort } = useSearch({
    from: Route.fullPath,
  });

  return <div>...</div>;
};
```

Or, you can loosen up the type-safety and get an optional `search` object by passing `strict: false`:

```tsx
function ProductList() {
  const search = useSearch({
    strict: false,
  });
  // {
  //   page: number | undefined
  //   filter: string | undefined
  //   sort: 'newest' | 'oldest' | 'price' | undefined
  // }

  return <div>...</div>;
}
```

## Writing Search Params

Now that you've learned how to read your route's search params, you'll be happy to know that you've already seen the primary APIs to modify and update them. Let's remind ourselves a bit

### `<Link search />`

The best way to update search params is to use the `search` prop on the `<Link />` component.

If the search for the current page shall be updated and the `from` prop is specified, the `to` prop can be omitted.  
Here's an example:

```tsx
// /routes/shop.products.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/shop/products")({
  validateSearch: productSearchSchema,
});

const ProductList = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link from={Route.fullPath} search={(prev) => ({ page: prev.page + 1 })}>
        Next Page
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
};
```

If you want to update the search params in a generic component that is rendered on multiple routes, specifying `from` can be challenging.

In this scenario you can set `to="."` which will give you access to loosely typed search params.  
Here is an example that illustrates this:

```tsx
// `page` is a search param that is defined in the __root route and hence available on all routes.
const PageSelector = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link to="." search={(prev) => ({ ...prev, page: prev.page + 1 })}>
        Next Page
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
};
```

If the generic component is only rendered in a specific subtree of the route tree, you can specify that subtree using `from`. Here you can omit `to='.'` if you want.

```tsx
// `page` is a search param that is defined in the /posts route and hence available on all of its child routes.
const PageSelector = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link
        from="/posts"
        to="."
        search={(prev) => ({ ...prev, page: prev.page + 1 })}
      >
        Next Page
      </Link>
    </div>
  )
```

### `useNavigate(), navigate({ search })`

The `navigate` function also accepts a `search` option that works the same way as the `search` prop on `<Link />`:

```tsx
// /routes/shop.products.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/shop/products/$productId")({
  validateSearch: productSearchSchema,
});

const ProductList = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate({ from: Route.fullPath });

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          navigate({
            search: (prev) => ({ page: prev.page + 1 }),
          });
        }}
      >
        Next Page
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### `router.navigate({ search })`

The `router.navigate` function works exactly the same way as the `useNavigate`/`navigate` hook/function above.

### `<Navigate search />`

The `<Navigate search />` component works exactly the same way as the `useNavigate`/`navigate` hook/function above, but accepts its options as props instead of a function argument.

## Transforming search with search middlewares

When link hrefs are built, by default the only thing that matters for the query string part is the `search` property of a `<Link>`.

TanStack Router provides a way to manipulate search params before the href is generated via **search middlewares**.
Search middlewares are functions that transform the search parameters when generating new links for a route or its descendants.
They are also executed upon navigation after search validation to allow manipulation of the query string.

The following example shows how to make sure that for **every** link that is being built, the `rootValue` search param is added _if_ it is part of the current search params. If a link specifies `rootValue` inside `search`, then that value is used for building the link.

```tsx
import { z } from "zod";
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { zodValidator } from "@tanstack/zod-adapter";

const searchSchema = z.object({
  rootValue: z.string().optional(),
});

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  validateSearch: zodValidator(searchSchema),
  search: {
    middlewares: [
      ({ search, next }) => {
        const result = next(search);
        return {
          rootValue: search.rootValue,
          ...result,
        };
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

Since this specific use case is quite common, TanStack Router provides a generic implementation to retain search params via `retainSearchParams`:

```tsx
import { z } from "zod";
import { createFileRoute, retainSearchParams } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { zodValidator } from "@tanstack/zod-adapter";

const searchSchema = z.object({
  rootValue: z.string().optional(),
});

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  validateSearch: zodValidator(searchSchema),
  search: {
    middlewares: [retainSearchParams(["rootValue"])],
  },
});
```

Another common use case is to strip out search params from links if their default value is set. TanStack Router provides a generic implementation for this use case via `stripSearchParams`:

```tsx
import { z } from "zod";
import { createFileRoute, stripSearchParams } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { zodValidator } from "@tanstack/zod-adapter";

const defaultValues = {
  one: "abc",
  two: "xyz",
};

const searchSchema = z.object({
  one: z.string().default(defaultValues.one),
  two: z.string().default(defaultValues.two),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/hello")({
  validateSearch: zodValidator(searchSchema),
  search: {
    // strip default values
    middlewares: [stripSearchParams(defaultValues)],
  },
});
```

Multiple middlewares can be chained. The following example shows how to combine both `retainSearchParams` and `stripSearchParams`.

```tsx
import {
  Link,
  createFileRoute,
  retainSearchParams,
  stripSearchParams,
} from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { z } from "zod";
import { zodValidator } from "@tanstack/zod-adapter";

const defaultValues = ["foo", "bar"];

export const Route = createFileRoute("/search")({
  validateSearch: zodValidator(
    z.object({
      retainMe: z.string().optional(),
      arrayWithDefaults: z.string().array().default(defaultValues),
      required: z.string(),
    }),
  ),
  search: {
    middlewares: [
      retainSearchParams(["retainMe"]),
      stripSearchParams({ arrayWithDefaults: defaultValues }),
    ],
  },
});
```

> [!WARNING]
> While every effort has been made to separate these APIs from changes to Tanstack Start, there are underlying shared implementations internally. Therefore these can be subject to change and should be regarded as experimental until Start reaches stable status.

Server Side Rendering (SSR) is the process of rendering a component on the server and sending the HTML markup to the client. The client then hydrates the markup into a fully interactive component.

There are usually two different flavors of SSR to be considered:

- Non-streaming SSR
  - The entire page is rendered on the server and sent to the client in one single HTML request, including the serialized data the application needs to hydrate on the client.
- Streaming SSR
  - The critical first paint of the page is rendered on the server and sent to the client in one single HTML request, including the serialized data the application needs to hydrate on the client
  - The rest of the page is then streamed to the client as it is rendered on the server.

This guide will explain how to implement both flavors of SSR with TanStack Router!

## Non-Streaming SSR

Non-Streaming server-side rendering is the classic process of rendering the markup for your entire application page on the server and sending the completed HTML markup (and data) to the client. The client then hydrates the markup into a fully interactive application again.

To implement non-streaming SSR with TanStack Router, you will need the following utilities:

- `RouterClient` from `@tanstack/react-router`
  - e.g. `<RouterClient router={router} />`
  - Rendering this component in your client entry will render your application and also automatically implement the `Wrap` component option on `Router`
- And, either:
  - `defaultRenderHandler` from `@tanstack/react-router`
    - This will render your application in your server entry and also automatically handle application-level hydration/dehydration and also automatically implement the RouterServer component.
      or:
  - `renderRouterToString` from `@tanstack/react-router`
    - This differs from defaultRenderHandler in that it allows you to manually specify the `Wrap` component option on `Router` together with any other providers you may need to wrap it with.
  - `RouterServer` from `@tanstack/react-router`
    - This implements the `Wrap` component option on `Router`

### Automatic Server History

On the client, Router defaults to using an instance of `createBrowserHistory`, which is the preferred type of history to use on the client. On the server, however, you will want to use an instance of `createMemoryHistory` instead. This is because `createBrowserHistory` uses the `window` object, which does not exist on the server. This is handled automatically for you in the RouterServer component.

### Automatic Loader Dehydration/Hydration

Resolved loader data fetched by routes is automatically dehydrated and rehydrated by TanStack Router so long as you complete the standard SSR steps outlined in this guide.

⚠️ If you are using deferred data streaming, you will also need to ensure that you have implemented the [SSR Streaming & Stream Transform](#streaming-ssr) pattern near the end of this guide.

For more information on how to utilize data loading, see the [Data Loading](../data-loading.md) guide.

### Router Creation

Since your router will exist both on the server and the client, it's important that you create your router in a way that is consistent between both of these environments. The easiest way to do this is to expose a `createRouter` function in a shared file that can be imported and called by both your server and client entry files.

```tsx
// src/router.tsx
import { createRouter as createTanstackRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

export function createRouter() {
  return createTanstackRouter({ routeTree });
}

declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
  interface Register {
    router: ReturnType<typeof createRouter>;
  }
}
```

### Rendering the Application on the Server

Now that you have a router instance that has loaded all of the critical data for the current URL, you can render your application on the server:

using `defaultRenderToString`

```tsx
// src/entry-server.tsx
import {
  createRequestHandler,
  defaultRenderToString,
} from "@tanstack/react-router/ssr/server";
import { createRouter } from "./router";

export async function render({ request }: { request: Request }) {
  const handler = createRequestHandler({ request, createRouter });

  return await handler(defaultRenderToString);
}
```

using `renderRouterToString`

```tsx
// src/entry-server.tsx
import {
  createRequestHandler,
  renderRouterToString,
  RouterServer,
} from "@tanstack/react-router/ssr/server";
import { createRouter } from "./router";

export function render({ request }: { request: Request }) {
  const handler = createRequestHandler({ request, createRouter });

  return handler(({ request, responseHeaders, router }) =>
    renderRouterToString({
      request,
      responseHeaders,
      router,
      children: <RouterServer router={router} />,
    }),
  );
}
```

NOTE: The createRequestHandler method requires a web api standard Request object, while the handler method will return a web api standard Response promise.

Should you be using a server framework like Express that uses its own Request and Response objects you would need to convert from the one to the other. Please have a look at the examples for how such an implementation might look like.

## Rendering the Application on the Client

On the client, things are much simpler.

- Create your router instance
- Render your application using the `<RouterClient />` component

[//]: # "ClientEntryFileExample"

```tsx
// src/entry-client.tsx
import { hydrateRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { RouterClient } from "@tanstack/react-router/ssr/client";
import { createRouter } from "./router";

const router = createRouter();

hydrateRoot(document, <RouterClient router={router} />);
```

[//]: # "ClientEntryFileExample"

With this setup, your application will be rendered on the server and then hydrated on the client!

## Streaming SSR

Streaming SSR is the most modern flavor of SSR and is the process of continuously and incrementally sending HTML markup to the client as it is rendered on the server. This is slightly different from traditional SSR in concept because beyond being able to dehydrate and rehydrate a critical first paint, markup and data with less priority or slower response times can be streamed to the client after the initial render, but in the same request.

This pattern can be useful for pages that have slow or high-latency data fetching requirements. For example, if you have a page that needs to fetch data from a third-party API, you can stream the critical initial markup and data to the client and then stream the less-critical third-party data to the client as it is resolved.

> [!NOTE]
> This streaming pattern is all automatic as long as you are using either `defaultStreamHandler` or `renderRouterToStream`.

using `defaultStreamHandler`

```tsx
// src/entry-server.tsx
import {
  createRequestHandler,
  defaultStreamHandler,
} from "@tanstack/react-router/ssr/server";
import { createRouter } from "./router";

export async function render({ request }: { request: Request }) {
  const handler = createRequestHandler({ request, createRouter });

  return await handler(defaultStreamHandler);
}
```

using `renderRouterToStream`

```tsx
// src/entry-server.tsx
import {
  createRequestHandler,
  renderRouterToStream,
  RouterServer,
} from "@tanstack/react-router/ssr/server";
import { createRouter } from "./router";

export function render({ request }: { request: Request }) {
  const handler = createRequestHandler({ request, createRouter });

  return handler(({ request, responseHeaders, router }) =>
    renderRouterToStream({
      request,
      responseHeaders,
      router,
      children: <RouterServer router={router} />,
    }),
  );
}
```

## Streaming Dehydration/Hydration

Streaming dehydration/hydration is an advanced pattern that goes beyond markup and allows you to dehydrate and stream any supporting data from the server to the client and rehydrate it on arrival. This is useful for applications that may need to further use/manage the underlying data that was used to render the initial markup on the server.

## Data Serialization

When using SSR, data passed between the server and the client must be serialized before it is sent across network-boundaries. TanStack Router handles this serialization using a very lightweight serializer that supports common data types beyond JSON.stringify/JSON.parse.

Out of the box, the following types are supported:

- `undefined`
- `Date`
- `Error`
- `FormData`

If you feel that there are other types that should be supported by default, please open an issue on the TanStack Router repository.

If you are using more complex data types like `Map`, `Set`, `BigInt`, etc, you may need to use a custom serializer to ensure that your type-definitions are accurate and your data is correctly serialized and deserialized. We are currently working on both a more robust serializer and a way to customize the serializer for your application. Open an issue if you are interested in helping out!

<file path="docs/react/guide/static-route-data.md">
---
title: Static Route Data
---

When creating routes, you can optionally specify a `staticData` property in the route's options. This object can literally contain anything you want as long as it's synchronously available when you create your route.

In addition to being able to access this data from the route itself, you can also access it from any match under the `match.staticData` property.

## Example

- `posts.tsx`

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  staticData: {
    customData: "Hello!",
  },
});
```

You can then access this data anywhere you have access to your routes, including matches that can be mapped back to their routes.

- `__root.tsx`

```tsx
import { createRootRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => {
    const matches = useMatches();

    return (
      <div>
        {matches.map((match) => {
          return <div key={match.id}>{match.staticData.customData}</div>;
        })}
      </div>
    );
  },
});
```

## Enforcing Static Data

If you want to enforce that a route has static data, you can use declaration merging to add a type to the route's static option:

```tsx
declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
  interface StaticDataRouteOption {
    customData: string;
  }
}
```

Now, if you try to create a route without the `customData` property, you'll get a type error:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  staticData: {
    // Property 'customData' is missing in type '{ customData: number; }' but required in type 'StaticDataRouteOption'.ts(2741)
  },
});
```

## Optional Static Data

If you want to make static data optional, simply add a `?` to the property:

```tsx
declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
  interface StaticDataRouteOption {
    customData?: string;
  }
}
```

As long as there are any required properties on the `StaticDataRouteOption`, you'll be required to pass in an object.

TanStack Start is a full-stack framework for building server-rendered React applications built on top of [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router).

To set up a TanStack Start project, you'll need to:

1. Install the dependencies
2. Add a configuration file
3. Create required templating

Follow this guide to build a basic TanStack Start web application. Together, we will use TanStack Start to:

- Serve an index page...
- Which displays a counter...
- With a button to increment the counter persistently.

[Here is what that will look like](https://stackblitz.com/github/tanstack/router/tree/main/examples/react/start-basic-counter)

Create a new project if you're starting fresh.

```shell
mkdir myApp
cd myApp
npm init -y
```

Create a `tsconfig.json` file with at least the following settings:

```jsonc
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler",
    "module": "Preserve",
    "target": "ES2022",
    "skipLibCheck": true,
  },
}
```

# Install Dependencies

TanStack Start is powered by the following packages and need to be installed as dependencies:

- [@tanstack/start](https://github.com/tanstack/start)
- [@tanstack/react-router](https://tanstack.com/router)
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/)

To install them, run:

```shell
npm i @tanstack/react-start @tanstack/react-router vite
```

You'll also need React and the Vite React plugin, so install their dependencies as well:

```shell
npm i react react-dom @vitejs/plugin-react
```

Please, for you, your fellow developers, and your users' sake, use TypeScript:

```shell
npm i -D typescript @types/react @types/react-dom
```

# Update Configuration Files

We'll then update our `package.json` to use Vite's CLI and set `"type": "module"`:

```jsonc
{
  // ...
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite dev",
    "build": "vite build",
    "start": "vite start",
  },
}
```

Then configure TanStack Start's `app.config.ts` file:

```typescript
// app.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@tanstack/react-start/config";

export default defineConfig({});
```

# Add the Basic Templating

There are 2 required files for TanStack Start usage:

1. The router configuration
2. The root of your application

Once configuration is done, we'll have a file tree that looks like the following:

```
.
├── app/
│   ├── routes/
│   │   └── `__root.tsx`
│   ├── `router.tsx`
│   ├── `routeTree.gen.ts`
├── `.gitignore`
├── `app.config.ts`
├── `package.json`
└── `tsconfig.json`
```

## The Router Configuration

This is the file that will dictate the behavior of TanStack Router used within Start for both the server and the client. Here, you can configure everything
from the default [preloading functionality](../preloading.md) to [caching staleness](../data-loading.md).

```tsx
// app/router.tsx
import { createRouter as createTanStackRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

export function createRouter() {
  const router = createTanStackRouter({
    routeTree,
  });

  return router;
}

declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
  interface Register {
    router: ReturnType<typeof createRouter>;
  }
}
```

> `routeTree.gen.ts` is not a file you're expected to have at this point.
> It will be generated when you run TanStack Start (via `npm run dev` or `npm run start`) for the first time.

## The Root of Your Application

Finally, we need to create the root of our application. This is the entry point for all application routes. The code in this file will wrap all other routes in the application.

```tsx
// app/routes/__root.tsx
import { createRootRoute, HeadContent, Scripts } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import * as React from "react";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  head: () => ({
    meta: [
      {
        charSet: "utf-8",
      },
      {
        name: "viewport",
        content: "width=device-width, initial-scale=1",
      },
      {
        title: "TanStack Start Starter",
      },
    ],
  }),
  component: RootComponent,
});

function RootComponent() {
  return (
    <RootDocument>
      <Outlet />
    </RootDocument>
  );
}

function RootDocument({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <HeadContent />
      </head>
      <body>
        {children}
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

# Writing Your First Route

Now that we have the basic templating setup, we can write our first route. This is done by creating a new file in the `app/routes` directory.

```tsx
// app/routes/index.tsx
import * as fs from "fs";
import { createFileRoute, useRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

const filePath = "count.txt";

async function readCount() {
  return parseInt(await fs.promises.readFile(filePath, "utf-8").catch(() => "0"));
}

const getCount = createServerFn({
  method: "GET",
}).handler(() => {
  return readCount();
});

const updateCount = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
  .validator((d: number) => d)
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    const count = await readCount();
    await fs.promises.writeFile(filePath, `${count + data}`);
  });

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  component: Home,
  loader: async () => await getCount(),
});

function Home() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const state = Route.useLoaderData();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        updateCount({ data: 1 }).then(() => {
          router.invalidate();
        });
      }}
    >
      Add 1 to {state}?
    </button>
  );
}
```

That's it! 🤯 You've now set up a TanStack Start project and written your first route. 🎉

You can now run `npm run dev` to start your server and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your route in action.

<file path="docs/react/guide/type-safety.md">

title: Type Safety
---

TanStack Router is built to be as type-safe as possible within the limits of the TypeScript compiler and runtime. This means that it's not only written in TypeScript, but that it also **fully infers the types it's provided and tenaciously pipes them through the entire routing experience**.

Ultimately, this means that you write **less types as a developer** and have **more confidence in your code** as it evolves.

## Route Definitions

### File-based Routing

Routes are hierarchical, and so are their definitions. If you're using file-based routing, much of the type-safety is already taken care of for you.

### Code-based Routing

If you're using the `Route` class directly, you'll need to be aware of how to ensure your routes are typed properly using the `Route`'s `getParentRoute` option. This is because child routes need to be aware of **all** of their parent routes types. Without this, those precious search params you parsed out of your _layout_ and _pathless layout_ routes, 3 levels up, would be lost to the JS void.

So, don't forget to pass the parent route to your child routes!

```tsx
const parentRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => parentRoute,
});
```

## Exported Hooks, Components, and Utilities

For the types of your router to work with top-level exports like `Link`, `useNavigate`, `useParams`, etc. they must permeate the type-script module boundary and be registered right into the library. To do this, we use declaration merging on the exported `Register` interface.

```ts
const router = createRouter({
  // ...
});

declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
  interface Register {
    router: typeof router;
  }
}
```

By registering your router with the module, you can now use the exported hooks, components, and utilities with your router's exact types.

## Fixing the Component Context Problem

Component context is a wonderful tool in React and other frameworks for providing dependencies to components. However, if that context is changing types as it moves throughout your component hierarchy, it becomes impossible for TypeScript to know how to infer those changes. To get around this, context-based hooks and components require that you give them a hint on how and where they are being used.

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  component: PostsComponent,
});

function PostsComponent() {
  // Each route has type-safe versions of most of the built-in hooks from TanStack Router
  const params = Route.useParams();
  const search = Route.useSearch();

  // Some hooks require context from the *entire* router, not just the current route. To achieve type-safety here,
  // we must pass the `from` param to tell the hook our relative position in the route hierarchy.
  const navigate = useNavigate({ from: Route.fullPath });
  // ... etc
}
```

Every hook and component that requires a context hint will have a `from` param where you can pass the ID or path of the route you are rendering within.

> 🧠 Quick tip: If your component is code-split, you can use the [getRouteApi function](../code-splitting.md#manually-accessing-route-apis-in-other-files-with-the-getrouteapi-helper) to avoid having to pass in the `Route.fullPath` to get access to the typed `useParams()` and `useSearch()` hooks.

### What if I don't know the route? What if it's a shared component?

The `from` property is optional, which means if you don't pass it, you'll get the router's best guess on what types will be available. Usually, that means you'll get a union of all of the types of all of the routes in the router.

### What if I pass the wrong `from` path?

It's technically possible to pass a `from` that satisfies TypeScript, but may not match the actual route you are rendering within at runtime. In this case, each hook and component that supports `from` will detect if your expectations don't match the actual route you are rendering within, and will throw a runtime error.

### What if I don't know the route, or it's a shared component, and I can't pass `from`?

If you are rendering a component that is shared across multiple routes, or you are rendering a component that is not within a route, you can pass `strict: false` instead of a `from` option. This will not only silence the runtime error, but will also give you relaxed, but accurate types for the potential hook you are calling. A good example of this is calling `useSearch` from a shared component:

```tsx
function MyComponent() {
  const search = useSearch({ strict: false });
}
```

In this case, the `search` variable will be typed as a union of all possible search params from all routes in the router.

## Router Context

Router context is so extremely useful as it's the ultimate hierarchical dependency injection. You can supply context to the router and to each and every route it renders. As you build up this context, TanStack Router will merge it down with the hierarchy of routes, so that each route has access to the context of all of its parents.

The `createRootRouteWithContext` factory creates a new router with the instantiated type, which then creates a requirement for you to fulfill the same type contract to your router, and will also ensure that your context is properly typed throughout the entire route tree.

```tsx
const rootRoute = createRootRouteWithContext<{ whateverYouWant: true }>()({
  component: App,
});

const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([
  // ... all child routes will have access to `whateverYouWant` in their context
]);

const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
  context: {
    // This will be required to be passed now
    whateverYouWant: true,
  },
});
```

## Performance Recommendations

As your application scales, TypeScript check times will naturally increase. There are a few things to keep in mind when your application scales to keep your TS check times down.

### Only infer types you need

A great pattern with client side data caches (TanStack Query, etc.) is to prefetch data. For example with TanStack Query you might have a route which calls `queryClient.ensureQueryData` in a `loader`.

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId/deep")({
  loader: ({ context: { queryClient }, params: { postId } }) =>
    queryClient.ensureQueryData(postQueryOptions(postId)),
  component: PostDeepComponent,
});

function PostDeepComponent() {
  const params = Route.useParams();
  const data = useSuspenseQuery(postQueryOptions(params.postId));

  return <></>;
}
```

This may look fine and for small route trees and you may not notice any TS performance issues. However in this case TS has to infer the loader's return type, despite it never being used in your route. If the loader data is a complex type with many routes that prefetch in this manner, it can slow down editor performance. In this case, the change is quite simple and let typescript infer Promise<void>.

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId/deep")({
  loader: async ({ context: { queryClient }, params: { postId } }) => {
    await queryClient.ensureQueryData(postQueryOptions(postId));
  },
  component: PostDeepComponent,
});

function PostDeepComponent() {
  const params = Route.useParams();
  const data = useSuspenseQuery(postQueryOptions(params.postId));

  return <></>;
}
```

This way the loader data is never inferred and it moves the inference out of the route tree to the first time you use `useSuspenseQuery`.

### Narrow to relevant routes as much as you possibly can

Consider the following usage of `Link`

```tsx
<Link to=".." search={{ page: 0 }} />
<Link to="." search={{ page: 0 }} />
```

**These examples are bad for TS performance**. That's because `search` resolves to a union of all `search` params for all routes and TS has to check whatever you pass to the `search` prop against this potentially big union. As your application grows, this check time will increase linearly to number of routes and search params. We have done our best to optimize for this case (TypeScript will typically do this work once and cache it) but the initial check against this large union is expensive. This also applies to `params` and other API's such as `useSearch`, `useParams`, `useNavigate` etc.

Instead you should try to narrow to relevant routes with `from` or `to`.

```tsx
<Link from={Route.fullPath} to=".." search={{page: 0}} />
<Link from="/posts" to=".." search={{page: 0}} />
```

Remember you can always pass a union to `to` or `from` to narrow the routes you're interested in.

```tsx
const from: '/posts/$postId/deep' | '/posts/' = '/posts/'
<Link from={from} to='..' />
```

You can also pass branches to `from` to only resolve `search` or `params` to be from any descendants of that branch:

```tsx
const from = '/posts'
<Link from={from} to='..' />
```

`/posts` could be a branch with many descendants which share the same `search` or `params`

### Consider using the object syntax of `addChildren`

It's typical of routes to have `params` `search`, `loaders` or `context` that can even reference external dependencies which are also heavy on TS inference. For such applications, using objects for creating the route tree can be more performant than tuples.

`createChildren` also can accept an object. For large route trees with complex routes and external libraries, objects can be much faster for TS to type check as opposed to large tuples. The performance gains depend on your project, what external dependencies you have and how the types for those libraries are written

```tsx
const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren({
  postsRoute: postsRoute.addChildren({ postRoute, postsIndexRoute }),
  indexRoute,
});
```

Note this syntax is more verbose but has better TS performance. With file based routing, the route tree is generated for you so a verbose route tree is not a concern

### Avoid internal types without narrowing

It's common you might want to re-use types exposed. For example you might be tempted to use `LinkProps` like so

```tsx
const props: LinkProps = {
  to: '/posts/',
}

return (
  <Link {...props}>
)
```

**This is VERY bad for TS Performance**. The problem here is `LinkProps` has no type arguments and is therefore an extremely large type. It includes `search` which is a union of all `search` params, it contains `params` which is a union of all `params`. When merging this object with `Link` it will do a structural comparison of this huge type.

Instead you can use `as const satisfies` to infer a precise type and not `LinkProps` directly to avoid the huge check

```tsx
const props = {
  to: '/posts/',
} as const satisfies LinkProps

return (
  <Link {...props}>
)
```

As `props` is not of type `LinkProps` and therefore this check is cheaper because the type is much more precise. You can also improve type checking further by narrowing `LinkProps`

```tsx
const props = {
  to: '/posts/',
} as const satisfies LinkProps<RegisteredRouter, string '/posts/'>

return (
  <Link {...props}>
)
```

This is even faster as we're checking against the narrowed `LinkProps` type.

You can also use this to narrow the type of `LinkProps` to a specific type to be used as a prop or parameter to a function

```tsx
export const myLinkProps = [
  {
    to: "/posts",
  },
  {
    to: "/posts/$postId",
    params: { postId: "postId" },
  },
] as const satisfies ReadonlyArray<LinkProps>;

export type MyLinkProps = (typeof myLinkProps)[number];

const MyComponent = (props: { linkProps: MyLinkProps }) => {
  return <Link {...props.linkProps} />;
};
```

This is faster than using `LinkProps` directly in a component because `MyLinkProps` is a much more precise type

Another solution is not to use `LinkProps` and to provide inversion of control to render a `Link` component narrowed to a specific route. Render props are a good method of inverting control to the user of a component

```tsx
export interface MyComponentProps {
  readonly renderLink: () => React.ReactNode;
}

const MyComponent = (props: MyComponentProps) => {
  return <div>{props.renderLink()}</div>;
};

const Page = () => {
  return <MyComponent renderLink={() => <Link to="/absolute" />} />;
};
```

This particular example is very fast as we've inverted control of where we're navigating to the user of the component. The `Link` is narrowed to the exact route
we want to navigate to

Most types exposed by TanStack Router are internal, subject to breaking changes and not always easy to use. That is why TanStack Router has a subset of exposed types focused on ease of use with the intension to be used externally. These types provide the same type safe experience from TanStack Router's runtime concepts on the type level, with flexibility of where to provide type checking

## Type checking Link options with `ValidateLinkOptions`

`ValidateLinkOptions` type checks object literal types to ensure they conform to `Link` options at inference sites. For example, you may have a generic `HeadingLink` component which accepts a `title` prop along with `linkOptions`, the idea being this component can be re-used for any navigation.

```tsx
export interface HeaderLinkProps<
  TRouter extends RegisteredRouter = RegisteredRouter,
  TOptions = unknown,
> {
  title: string;
  linkOptions: ValidateLinkOptions<TRouter, TOptions>;
}

export function HeadingLink<TRouter extends RegisteredRouter, TOptions>(
  props: HeaderLinkProps<TRouter, TOptions>,
): React.ReactNode;
export function HeadingLink(props: HeaderLinkProps): React.ReactNode {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{props.title}</h1>
      <Link {...props.linkOptions} />
    </>
  );
}
```

A more permissive overload of `HeadingLink` is used to avoid type assertions you would otherwise have to do with the generic signature. Using a looser signature without type parameters is an easy way to avoid type assertions in the implementation of `HeadingLink`

All type parameters for utilities are optional but for the best TypeScript performance `TRouter` should always be specified for the public facing signature. And `TOptions` should always be used at inference sites like `HeadingLink` to infer the `linkOptions` to correctly narrow `params` and `search`

The result of this is that `linkOptions` in the following is completely type-safe

```tsx
<HeadingLink title="Posts" linkOptions={{ to: '/posts' }} />
<HeadingLink title="Post" linkOptions={{ to: '/posts/$postId', params: {postId: 'postId'} }} />
```

## Type checking an array of Link options with `ValidateLinkOptionsArray`

All navigation type utilities have an array variant. `ValidateLinkOptionsArray` enables type checking of an array of `Link` options. For example, you might have a generic `Menu` component where each item is a `Link`.

```tsx
export interface MenuProps<
  TRouter extends RegisteredRouter = RegisteredRouter,
  TItems extends ReadonlyArray<unknown> = ReadonlyArray<unknown>,
> {
  items: ValidateLinkOptionsArray<TRouter, TItems>;
}

export function Menu<
  TRouter extends RegisteredRouter = RegisteredRouter,
  TItems extends ReadonlyArray<unknown>,
>(props: MenuProps<TRouter, TItems>): React.ReactNode;
export function Menu(props: MenuProps): React.ReactNode {
  return (
    <ul>
      {props.items.map((item) => (
        <li>
          <Link {...item} />
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

This of course allows the following `items` prop to be completely type-safe

```tsx
<Menu
  items={[{ to: "/posts" }, { to: "/posts/$postId", params: { postId: "postId" } }]}
/>
```

It is also possible to fix `from` for each `Link` options in the array. This would allow all `Menu` items to navigate relative to `from`. Additional type checking of `from` can be provided by the `ValidateFromPath` utility

```tsx
export interface MenuProps<
  TRouter extends RegisteredRouter = RegisteredRouter,
  TItems extends ReadonlyArray<unknown> = ReadonlyArray<unknown>,
  TFrom extends string = string,
> {
  from: ValidateFromPath<TRouter, TFrom>;
  items: ValidateLinkOptionsArray<TRouter, TItems, TFrom>;
}

export function Menu<
  TRouter extends RegisteredRouter = RegisteredRouter,
  TItems extends ReadonlyArray<unknown>,
  TFrom extends string = string,
>(props: MenuProps<TRouter, TItems, TFrom>): React.ReactNode;
export function Menu(props: MenuProps): React.ReactNode {
  return (
    <ul>
      {props.items.map((item) => (
        <li>
          <Link {...item} from={props.from} />
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

`ValidateLinkOptionsArray` allows you to fix `from` by providing an extra type parameter. The result is a type safe array of `Link` options providing navigation relative to `from`

```tsx
<Menu
  from="/posts"
  items={[{ to: "." }, { to: "./$postId", params: { postId: "postId" } }]}
/>
```

## Type checking redirect options with `ValidateRedirectOptions`

`ValidateRedirectOptions` type checks object literal types to ensure they conform to redirect options at inference sites. For example, you may need a generic `fetchOrRedirect` function which accepts a `url` along with `redirectOptions`, the idea being this function will redirect when the `fetch` fails.

```tsx
export async function fetchOrRedirect<
  TRouter extends RegisteredRouter = RegisteredRouter,
  TOptions,
>(
  url: string,
  redirectOptions: ValidateRedirectOptions<TRouter, TOptions>,
): Promise<unknown>;
export async function fetchOrRedirect(
  url: string,
  redirectOptions: ValidateRedirectOptions,
): Promise<unknown> {
  const response = await fetch(url);

  if (!response.ok && response.status === 401) {
    throw redirect(redirectOptions);
  }

  return await response.json();
}
```

The result is that `redirectOptions` passed to `fetchOrRedirect` is completely type-safe

```tsx
fetchOrRedirect("http://example.com/", { to: "/login" });
```

## Type checking navigate options with `ValidateNavigateOptions`

`ValidateNavigateOptions` type checks object literal types to ensure they conform to navigate options at inference sites. For example, you may want to write a custom hook to enable/disable navigation.

[//]: # "TypeCheckingNavigateOptionsWithValidateNavigateOptionsImpl"

```tsx
export interface UseConditionalNavigateResult {
  enable: () => void;
  disable: () => void;
  navigate: () => void;
}

export function useConditionalNavigate<
  TRouter extends RegisteredRouter = RegisteredRouter,
  TOptions,
>(
  navigateOptions: ValidateNavigateOptions<TRouter, TOptions>,
): UseConditionalNavigateResult;
export function useConditionalNavigate(
  navigateOptions: ValidateNavigateOptions,
): UseConditionalNavigateResult {
  const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState(false);
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  return {
    enable: () => setEnabled(true),
    disable: () => setEnabled(false),
    navigate: () => {
      if (enabled) {
        navigate(navigateOptions);
      }
    },
  };
}
```

[//]: # "TypeCheckingNavigateOptionsWithValidateNavigateOptionsImpl"

The result of this is that `navigateOptions` passed to `useConditionalNavigate` is completely type-safe and we can enable/disable navigation based on react state

```tsx
const { enable, disable, navigate } = useConditionalNavigate({
  to: "/posts/$postId",
  params: { postId: "postId" },
});
```

### Search Result Navigation

Handle search result navigation with query preservation:

```tsx
import { Link, useSearch } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function SearchResults() {
  const search = useSearch({ from: "/search" });

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Preserve search query, change view */}
      <nav>
        <Link search={(prev) => ({ ...prev, view: "grid" })}>Grid View</Link>
        <Link search={(prev) => ({ ...prev, view: "list" })}>List View</Link>
      </nav>

      {/* Pagination with query preservation */}
      <div>
        {search.page > 1 && (
          <Link search={(prev) => ({ ...prev, page: prev.page - 1 })}>Previous</Link>
        )}

        <Link search={(prev) => ({ ...prev, page: (prev.page || 1) + 1 })}>Next</Link>
      </div>

      {/* Related searches */}
      <div>
        Related searches:
        {["laptops gaming", "laptops business", "laptops student"].map((suggestion) => (
          <Link
            key={suggestion}
            search={(prev) => ({ ...prev, query: suggestion, page: 1 })}
          >
            {suggestion}
          </Link>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Filter Navigation

Build filtering interfaces with search parameter navigation:

```tsx
import { Link, useSearch } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const categories = ["electronics", "clothing", "books", "home"];
const sortOptions = [
  { value: "relevance", label: "Relevance" },
  { value: "price-asc", label: "Price: Low to High" },
  { value: "price-desc", label: "Price: High to Low" },
  { value: "rating", label: "Customer Rating" },
];

function FilterNavigation() {
  const search = useSearch({ from: "/products" });

  return (
    <aside>
      {/* Category filters */}
      <div>
        <h3>Categories</h3>
        {categories.map((category) => (
          <Link
            key={category}
            search={(prev) => ({
              ...prev,
              category: prev.category === category ? undefined : category,
              page: 1,
            })}
            className={search.category === category ? "active" : ""}
          >
            {category}
          </Link>
        ))}
      </div>

      {/* Sort options */}
      <div>
        <h3>Sort By</h3>
        {sortOptions.map((option) => (
          <Link
            key={option.value}
            search={(prev) => ({ ...prev, sort: option.value, page: 1 })}
            className={search.sort === option.value ? "active" : ""}
          >
            {option.label}
          </Link>
        ))}
      </div>

      {/* Clear all filters */}
      <Link
        search={(prev) => {
          const { category, sort, minPrice, maxPrice, ...rest } = prev;
          return rest;
        }}
      >
        Clear All Filters
      </Link>
    </aside>
  );
}
```

### Programmatic Search Controls

Navigate programmatically with search parameter updates:

```tsx
import { useNavigate } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function SearchControls() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleSortChange = (sortBy: string) => {
    navigate({
      search: (prev) => ({ ...prev, sort: sortBy, page: 1 }),
    });
  };

  const handleClearFilters = () => {
    navigate({
      search: (prev) => {
        const { category, minPrice, maxPrice, ...rest } = prev;
        return rest;
      },
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <select onChange={(e) => handleSortChange(e.target.value)}>
        <option value="relevance">Sort by Relevance</option>
        <option value="price-asc">Price: Low to High</option>
        <option value="price-desc">Price: High to Low</option>
      </select>

      <button onClick={handleClearFilters}>Clear Filters</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Content Staged from navigate-with-search-params.md

### Performance Issues with Functional Updates

**Problem:** Complex functional updates cause unnecessary re-renders.

```tsx
// ❌ Wrong - complex computation in render
<Link search={(prev) => {
  // Expensive computation on every render
  const result = expensiveCalculation(prev)
  return { ...prev, computed: result }
}}>
  Update
</Link>

// ✅ Correct - memoize or use callback
const updateSearch = useCallback((prev) => {
  const result = expensiveCalculation(prev)
  return { ...prev, computed: result }
}, [])

<Link search={updateSearch}>Update</Link>
```

### Navigation During Render

**Problem:** Calling navigate during component render causes infinite loops.

```tsx
function ProblematicComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  // ❌ Wrong - navigate during render
  if (someCondition) {
    navigate({ search: { redirect: true } });
  }

  return <div>Content</div>;
}

function FixedComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  // ✅ Correct - navigate in effect
  useEffect(() => {
    if (someCondition) {
      navigate({ search: { redirect: true } });
    }
  }, [someCondition, navigate]);

  return <div>Content</div>;
}
```

### Navigation with State Synchronization

Keep component state in sync with URL search parameters:

```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useNavigate, useSearch } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function SynchronizedForm() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const search = useSearch({ from: "/products" });

  // Local state synced with URL
  const [localFilters, setLocalFilters] = useState({
    minPrice: search.minPrice || 0,
    maxPrice: search.maxPrice || 1000,
    inStock: search.inStock || false,
  });

  // Update local state when URL changes
  useEffect(() => {
    setLocalFilters({
      minPrice: search.minPrice || 0,
      maxPrice: search.maxPrice || 1000,
      inStock: search.inStock || false,
    });
  }, [search.minPrice, search.maxPrice, search.inStock]);

  const applyFilters = () => {
    navigate({
      search: (prev) => ({
        ...prev,
        ...localFilters,
        page: 1, // Reset pagination
      }),
    });
  };

  const resetFilters = () => {
    const defaultFilters = { minPrice: 0, maxPrice: 1000, inStock: false };
    setLocalFilters(defaultFilters);

    navigate({
      search: (prev) => {
        const { minPrice, maxPrice, inStock, ...rest } = prev;
        return rest;
      },
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <label>
        Min Price:
        <input
          type="number"
          value={localFilters.minPrice}
          onChange={(e) =>
            setLocalFilters((prev) => ({
              ...prev,
              minPrice: parseInt(e.target.value) || 0,
            }))
          }
        />
      </label>

      <label>
        Max Price:
        <input
          type="number"
          value={localFilters.maxPrice}
          onChange={(e) =>
            setLocalFilters((prev) => ({
              ...prev,
              maxPrice: parseInt(e.target.value) || 1000,
            }))
          }
        />
      </label>

      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={localFilters.inStock}
          onChange={(e) =>
            setLocalFilters((prev) => ({
              ...prev,
              inStock: e.target.checked,
            }))
          }
        />
        In Stock Only
      </label>

      <button onClick={applyFilters}>Apply Filters</button>
      <button onClick={resetFilters}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Form with Search Parameter Validation

```tsx
const handleFormSubmit = (formData: FormData) => {
  const query = formData.get("query") as string;
  const page = parseInt(formData.get("page") as string) || 1;

  safeNavigate({ query, page });
};

return (
  <form action={handleFormSubmit}>
    <input name="query" placeholder="Search..." required />
    <input name="page" type="number" defaultValue="1" />
    <button type="submit">Search</button>
  </form>
);
```

title: Work with Arrays, Objects, and Dates in Search Parameters
---

Learn to handle arrays, objects, dates, and nested data structures in search parameters while maintaining type safety and URL compatibility.

## Quick Start

Complex search parameters go beyond simple strings and numbers. TanStack Router's JSON-first approach makes it easy to handle arrays, objects, dates, and nested structures:

```tsx
// Example of complex search parameters
const complexSearch = {
  tags: ["typescript", "react", "router"], // Array
  filters: {
    // Nested object
    category: "web",
    minRating: 4.5,
    active: true,
  },
  dateRange: {
    // Date objects
    start: new Date("2024-01-01"),
    end: new Date("2024-12-31"),
  },
  pagination: {
    // Nested pagination
    page: 1,
    size: 20,
    sort: { field: "name", direction: "asc" },
  },
};
```

## Working with Arrays

Arrays are commonly used for filters, tags, categories, and multi-select options.

### Basic Array Validation

```tsx
// routes/products.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { z } from "zod";

const searchSchema = z.object({
  categories: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
  tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  priceRange: z.array(z.number()).length(2).optional(), // [min, max]
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/products")({
  validateSearch: searchSchema,
  component: ProductsComponent,
});

function ProductsComponent() {
  const { categories, tags, priceRange } = Route.useSearch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Active Categories: {categories.join(", ")}</h2>
      {tags && <p>Tags: {tags.join(", ")}</p>}
      {priceRange && (
        <p>
          Price: ${priceRange[0]} - ${priceRange[1]}
        </p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Navigating with Arrays

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function FilterControls() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Add to existing array */}
      <Link
        to="/products"
        search={(prev) => ({
          ...prev,
          categories: [...(prev.categories || []), "electronics"],
        })}
      >
        Add Electronics
      </Link>

      {/* Replace entire array */}
      <Link to="/products" search={{ categories: ["books", "music"] }}>
        Books & Music Only
      </Link>

      {/* Remove from array */}
      <Link
        to="/products"
        search={(prev) => ({
          ...prev,
          categories: prev.categories?.filter((cat) => cat !== "electronics") || [],
        })}
      >
        Remove Electronics
      </Link>

      {/* Clear array */}
      <Link to="/products" search={(prev) => ({ ...prev, categories: [] })}>
        Clear All
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Advanced Array Patterns

```tsx
// routes/search.tsx
const advancedArraySchema = z.object({
  // Array of objects
  filters: z
    .array(
      z.object({
        field: z.string(),
        operator: z.enum(["eq", "gt", "lt", "contains"]),
        value: z.union([z.string(), z.number(), z.boolean()]),
      }),
    )
    .default([]),

  // Array with constraints
  selectedIds: z.array(z.string().uuid()).max(10).default([]),

  // Array with transformation
  sortFields: z
    .array(z.string())
    .transform((arr) => arr.filter((field) => ["name", "date", "price"].includes(field)))
    .default(["name"]),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/search")({
  validateSearch: advancedArraySchema,
  component: SearchComponent,
});
```

## Working with Objects

Objects are useful for grouped parameters, complex filters, and nested configurations.

### Basic Object Validation

```tsx
// routes/dashboard.tsx
const dashboardSchema = z.object({
  view: z
    .object({
      layout: z.enum(["grid", "list", "cards"]).default("grid"),
      columns: z.number().min(1).max(6).default(3),
      showDetails: z.boolean().default(false),
    })
    .default({}),

  filters: z
    .object({
      status: z.enum(["active", "inactive", "pending"]).optional(),
      dateCreated: z
        .object({
          after: z.string().optional(),
          before: z.string().optional(),
        })
        .optional(),
      metadata: z.record(z.string()).optional(), // Dynamic object keys
    })
    .default({}),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/dashboard")({
  validateSearch: dashboardSchema,
  component: DashboardComponent,
});

function DashboardComponent() {
  const { view, filters } = Route.useSearch();

  return (
    <div>
      <div className={`layout-${view.layout} columns-${view.columns}`}>
        {/* Render based on complex object state */}
      </div>

      {filters.status && <p>Status: {filters.status}</p>}
      {filters.dateCreated?.after && <p>Created after: {filters.dateCreated.after}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Navigating with Objects

```tsx
function ViewControls() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Update nested object property */}
      <Link
        to="/dashboard"
        search={(prev) => ({
          ...prev,
          view: {
            ...prev.view,
            layout: "list",
          },
        })}
      >
        List View
      </Link>

      {/* Update multiple nested properties */}
      <Link
        to="/dashboard"
        search={(prev) => ({
          ...prev,
          view: {
            ...prev.view,
            layout: "grid",
            columns: 4,
            showDetails: true,
          },
        })}
      >
        4-Column Grid with Details
      </Link>

      {/* Deep merge with library for complex updates */}
      <Link
        to="/dashboard"
        search={(prev) =>
          merge(prev, {
            filters: {
              dateCreated: { after: "2024-01-01" },
            },
          })
        }
      >
        Filter Recent Items
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}

// For deep merging, use a well-tested library:

// Option 1: Lodash (most popular, full-featured)
// npm install lodash-es
// import { merge } from 'lodash-es'

// Option 2: deepmerge (lightweight, focused)
// npm install deepmerge
// import merge from 'deepmerge'

// Option 3: Ramda (functional programming style)
// npm install ramda
// import { mergeDeepRight as merge } from 'ramda'

// Example with deepmerge (recommended for most cases):
import merge from "deepmerge";

// Handles arrays intelligently - combines by default
const result = merge(
  { filters: { tags: ["react"] } },
  { filters: { tags: ["typescript"] } },
);
// Result: { filters: { tags: ['react', 'typescript'] } }

// Override array merging behavior if needed
const overwriteResult = merge(
  { filters: { tags: ["react"] } },
  { filters: { tags: ["typescript"] } },
  { arrayMerge: (dest, source) => source }, // Overwrite instead of combine
);
// Result: { filters: { tags: ['typescript'] } }
```

## Working with Dates

Dates require special handling for URL serialization and validation.

### Date Validation and Serialization

```tsx
// routes/events.tsx
const eventSchema = z.object({
  // ISO string dates
  startDate: z.string().datetime().optional(),
  endDate: z.string().datetime().optional(),

  // Date range as object
  dateRange: z
    .object({
      start: z.string().datetime(),
      end: z.string().datetime(),
    })
    .optional(),

  // Transform string to Date object
  selectedDate: z
    .string()
    .datetime()
    .transform((str) => new Date(str))
    .optional(),

  // Relative dates
  timeFilter: z.enum(["today", "week", "month", "year"]).default("week"),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/events")({
  validateSearch: eventSchema,
  component: EventsComponent,
});

function EventsComponent() {
  const search = Route.useSearch();

  // Convert string dates back to Date objects for display
  const startDate = search.startDate ? new Date(search.startDate) : null;
  const endDate = search.endDate ? new Date(search.endDate) : null;

  return (
    <div>
      {startDate && <p>Events from: {startDate.toLocaleDateString()}</p>}
      {search.selectedDate && <p>Selected: {search.selectedDate.toLocaleDateString()}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Date Navigation Patterns

```tsx
function DateControls() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const setDateRange = (start: Date, end: Date) => {
    navigate({
      to: "/events",
      search: (prev) => ({
        ...prev,
        dateRange: {
          start: start.toISOString(),
          end: end.toISOString(),
        },
      }),
    });
  };

  const setRelativeDate = (period: string) => {
    const now = new Date();
    let start: Date;

    switch (period) {
      case "today":
        start = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth(), now.getDate());
        break;
      case "week":
        start = new Date(now.getTime() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
        break;
      case "month":
        start = new Date(now.getFullYear(), now.getMonth() - 1, now.getDate());
        break;
      default:
        start = now;
    }

    setDateRange(start, now);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setRelativeDate("today")}>Today</button>
      <button onClick={() => setRelativeDate("week")}>Past Week</button>
      <button onClick={() => setRelativeDate("month")}>Past Month</button>

      {/* Date picker integration */}
      <input
        type="date"
        onChange={(e) => {
          const date = new Date(e.target.value);
          navigate({
            to: "/events",
            search: (prev) => ({
              ...prev,
              selectedDate: date.toISOString(),
            }),
          });
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Nested Data Structures

Complex applications often need deeply nested search parameters.

### Complex Nested Schema

```tsx
// routes/analytics.tsx
const analyticsSchema = z.object({
  dashboard: z
    .object({
      widgets: z
        .array(
          z.object({
            id: z.string(),
            type: z.enum(["chart", "table", "metric"]),
            config: z.object({
              title: z.string(),
              dataSource: z.string(),
              filters: z.array(
                z.object({
                  field: z.string(),
                  operator: z.string(),
                  value: z.any(),
                }),
              ),
              visualization: z
                .object({
                  chartType: z.enum(["line", "bar", "pie"]).optional(),
                  colors: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
                  axes: z
                    .object({
                      x: z.string(),
                      y: z.array(z.string()),
                    })
                    .optional(),
                })
                .optional(),
            }),
          }),
        )
        .default([]),

      layout: z
        .object({
          columns: z.number().min(1).max(12).default(2),
          gap: z.number().default(16),
          responsive: z.boolean().default(true),
        })
        .default({}),

      timeRange: z
        .object({
          preset: z.enum(["1h", "24h", "7d", "30d", "custom"]).default("24h"),
          custom: z
            .object({
              start: z.string().datetime(),
              end: z.string().datetime(),
            })
            .optional(),
        })
        .default({}),
    })
    .default({}),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/analytics")({
  validateSearch: analyticsSchema,
  component: AnalyticsComponent,
});
```

### Managing Complex State Updates

```tsx
function AnalyticsControls() {
  const search = Route.useSearch();
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  // Helper to update nested widget config
  const updateWidgetConfig = (widgetId: string, configUpdate: any) => {
    navigate({
      to: "/analytics",
      search: (prev) => ({
        ...prev,
        dashboard: {
          ...prev.dashboard,
          widgets: prev.dashboard.widgets.map((widget) =>
            widget.id === widgetId
              ? {
                  ...widget,
                  config: { ...widget.config, ...configUpdate },
                }
              : widget,
          ),
        },
      }),
    });
  };

  // Helper to add new widget
  const addWidget = (widget: any) => {
    navigate({
      to: "/analytics",
      search: (prev) => ({
        ...prev,
        dashboard: {
          ...prev.dashboard,
          widgets: [...prev.dashboard.widgets, widget],
        },
      }),
    });
  };

  // Helper to update layout
  const updateLayout = (layoutUpdate: any) => {
    navigate({
      to: "/analytics",
      search: (prev) => ({
        ...prev,
        dashboard: {
          ...prev.dashboard,
          layout: { ...prev.dashboard.layout, ...layoutUpdate },
        },
      }),
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => updateLayout({ columns: 3 })}>3 Columns</button>

      <button
        onClick={() =>
          addWidget({
            id: Date.now().toString(),
            type: "chart",
            config: {
              title: "New Chart",
              dataSource: "default",
              filters: [],
            },
          })
        }
      >
        Add Chart Widget
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Selective Updates with Selectors

```tsx
// Only re-render when specific nested values change
function WidgetComponent({ widgetId }: { widgetId: string }) {
  // Use selector to avoid unnecessary re-renders
  const widget = Route.useSearch({
    select: (search) => search.dashboard.widgets.find((w) => w.id === widgetId),
  });

  const layout = Route.useSearch({
    select: (search) => search.dashboard.layout,
  });

  if (!widget) return null;

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        gridColumn: `span ${Math.ceil(12 / layout.columns)}`,
      }}
    >
      <h3>{widget.config.title}</h3>
      {/* Widget content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Memoization for Complex Transforms

```tsx
import { useMemo } from "react";

function ComplexDataComponent() {
  const search = Route.useSearch();

  // Memoize expensive transformations
  const processedData = useMemo(() => {
    return search.dashboard.widgets
      .filter((widget) => widget.type === "chart")
      .map((widget) => ({
        ...widget,
        computedMetrics: expensiveCalculation(widget.config),
      }));
  }, [search.dashboard.widgets]);

  return (
    <div>
      {processedData.map((widget) => (
        <ComplexChart key={widget.id} data={widget} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Production Checklist

- [ ] **Array bounds validation** - Use `.min()`, `.max()`, `.length()` constraints
- [ ] **Date format consistency** - Stick to ISO strings for URL compatibility
- [ ] **Object depth limits** - Avoid excessively nested structures for URL length
- [ ] **Performance testing** - Test with large arrays/objects in search params
- [ ] **URL length limits** - Most browsers limit URLs to ~2000 characters
- [ ] **Fallback values** - Provide sensible defaults for all complex types
- [ ] **Type safety** - Ensure schemas match your component expectations
- [ ] **Serialization testing** - Verify round-trip serialization works correctly

## Common Problems

### Problem: Array Parameters Not Updating

**Symptoms:** Link clicks don't update array search parameters.

**Cause:** Directly mutating arrays instead of creating new ones.

**Solution:** Always create new arrays when updating:

```tsx
// ❌ Wrong - mutates existing array
search={(prev) => {
  prev.categories.push('new-item')
  return prev
}}

// ✅ Correct - creates new array
search={(prev) => ({
  ...prev,
  categories: [...prev.categories, 'new-item']
})}
```

### Problem: Dates Not Serializing Correctly

**Symptoms:** Date objects become `[object Object]` in URL.

**Cause:** Attempting to serialize Date objects directly.

**Solution:** Convert dates to ISO strings:

```tsx
// ❌ Wrong - Date objects don't serialize
search={{
  startDate: new Date() // Becomes "[object Object]"
}}

// ✅ Correct - Use ISO strings
search={{
  startDate: new Date().toISOString()
}}
```

### Problem: Deep Object Updates Not Working

**Symptoms:** Nested object properties don't update as expected.

**Cause:** Shallow merging doesn't update nested properties.

**Solution:** Use proper deep merging or spread operators:

```tsx
// ❌ Wrong - shallow merge loses nested properties
search={(prev) => ({
  ...prev,
  filters: { category: 'new' } // Loses other filter properties
})}

// ✅ Correct - preserve nested properties
search={(prev) => ({
  ...prev,
  filters: {
    ...prev.filters,
    category: 'new'
  }
})}
```

### Problem: URL Too Long Error

**Symptoms:** Browser errors with very complex search parameters.

**Cause:** Exceeding browser URL length limits (~2000 characters).

**Solutions:**

1. **Simplify data structures** - Remove unnecessary nesting
2. **Use compression** - Implement custom serialization
3. **Store in session** - Keep complex state in sessionStorage with URL key
4. **Pagination** - Break large arrays into pages

```tsx
// Option 3: Session storage approach
const sessionKey = Route.useSearch({ select: (s) => s.sessionKey });
const complexData = useMemo(() => {
  if (sessionKey) {
    return JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem(sessionKey) || "{}");
  }
  return {};
}, [sessionKey]);
```

### Problem: Performance Issues with Large Objects

**Symptoms:** Slow navigation and re-renders with complex search parameters.

**Cause:** Large objects causing expensive serialization and comparison operations.

**Solutions:**

1. **Use selectors** to limit re-renders
2. **Memoize expensive calculations**
3. **Consider alternatives** like context or state management

```tsx
// Use selector to minimize re-renders
const onlyNeededData = Route.useSearch({
  select: (search) => ({
    currentPage: search.pagination.page,
    pageSize: search.pagination.size,
  }),
});
```

## Common Next Steps

title: How to Debug Common Router Issues
---

This guide covers debugging common TanStack Router problems, from route matching failures to navigation issues and performance problems.

## Quick Start

Use TanStack Router DevTools for real-time debugging, add strategic console logging, and follow systematic troubleshooting patterns to identify and resolve router issues quickly.

---

## Essential Debugging Tools

### 1. TanStack Router DevTools

Install and configure the DevTools for the best debugging experience:

```bash
npm install @tanstack/router-devtools
```

```tsx
// src/App.tsx
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from "@tanstack/router-devtools";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
      {/* Only shows in development */}
      <TanStackRouterDevtools router={router} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**DevTools Features:**

- **Route Tree Visualization** - See your entire route structure
- **Current Route State** - Inspect active route data, params, and search
- **Navigation History** - Track navigation events and timing
- **Route Matching** - See which routes match current URL
- **Performance Metrics** - Monitor route load times and re-renders

### 2. Debug Mode Configuration

Enable debug mode for detailed console logging:

```tsx
const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
  defaultPreload: "intent",
  context: {
    // your context
  },
  // Enable debug mode
  debug: true,
});
```

### 3. Browser DevTools Setup

**Add router to global scope for debugging:**

```tsx
// In development only
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
  window.router = router;
}

// Console debugging commands:
// router.state - current router state
// router.navigate() - programmatic navigation
// router.history - navigation history
```

---

## Route Matching Issues

### Problem: Route Not Found (404)

**Symptoms:**

- Route exists but shows 404 or "Not Found"
- Console shows route matching failures

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Check Route Path Definition**

```tsx
// ❌ Common mistake - missing leading slash
const route = createRoute({
  path: "about", // Should be '/about'
  // ...
});

// ✅ Correct
const route = createRoute({
  path: "/about",
  // ...
});
```

2. **Verify Route Tree Structure**

```tsx
// Debug route tree in console
console.log("Route tree:", router.routeTree);
console.log("All routes:", router.flatRoutes);
```

3. **Check Parent Route Configuration**

```tsx
// Ensure parent route is properly defined
const childRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => parentRoute, // Must return correct parent
  path: "/child",
  // ...
});
```

### Problem: Route Parameters Not Working

**Symptoms:**

- `useParams()` returns undefined or wrong values
- Route params not being parsed correctly

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Verify Parameter Syntax**

```tsx
// ❌ Wrong parameter syntax
path: "/users/{id}"; // Should use $

// ✅ Correct parameter syntax
path: "/users/$userId";
```

2. **Check Parameter Parsing**

```tsx
const route = createRoute({
  path: "/users/$userId",
  // Add parameter validation/parsing
  params: {
    parse: (params) => ({
      userId: Number(params.userId), // Convert to number
    }),
    stringify: (params) => ({
      userId: String(params.userId), // Convert back to string
    }),
  },
  component: () => {
    const { userId } = Route.useParams();
    console.log("User ID:", userId, typeof userId); // Debug output
    return <div>User {userId}</div>;
  },
});
```

3. **Debug Current URL and Params**

```tsx
function DebugParams() {
  const location = useLocation();
  const params = Route.useParams();

  console.log("Current pathname:", location.pathname);
  console.log("Parsed params:", params);

  return null; // Just for debugging
}
```

---

## Navigation Issues

### Problem: Navigation Not Working

**Symptoms:**

- Links don't navigate
- Programmatic navigation fails silently
- Browser URL doesn't update

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Check Link Configuration**

```tsx
// ❌ Common mistakes
<Link to="about">About</Link> // Missing leading slash
<Link href="/about">About</Link> // Wrong prop (href instead of to)

// ✅ Correct
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

2. **Debug Navigation Calls**

```tsx
function NavigationDebug() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleNavigate = () => {
    console.log("Attempting navigation...");
    navigate({
      to: "/dashboard",
      search: { tab: "settings" },
    })
      .then(() => console.log("Navigation successful"))
      .catch((err) => console.error("Navigation failed:", err));
  };

  return <button onClick={handleNavigate}>Navigate</button>;
}
```

3. **Check Router Context**

```tsx
// Ensure component is inside RouterProvider
function ComponentWithNavigation() {
  const router = useRouter(); // Will throw error if outside provider
  console.log("Router state:", router.state);

  return <div>...</div>;
}
```

### Problem: Navigation Redirects Unexpectedly

**Symptoms:**

- Navigating to one route but ending up somewhere else
- Infinite redirect loops

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Check Route Guards**

```tsx
const route = createRoute({
  path: "/dashboard",
  beforeLoad: ({ context, location }) => {
    console.log("Before load - location:", location.pathname);
    console.log("Auth state:", context.auth);

    if (!context.auth.isAuthenticated) {
      console.log("Redirecting to login...");
      throw redirect({ to: "/login" });
    }
  },
  // ...
});
```

2. **Debug Redirect Chains**

```tsx
// Add to router configuration
const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
  context: {
    /* ... */
  },
  // Log all navigation events
  onNavigate: ({ location, type }) => {
    console.log(`Navigation (${type}):`, location.pathname);
  },
});
```

## Data Loading Problems

### Problem: Route Data Not Loading

**Symptoms:**

- `useLoaderData()` returns undefined
- Loading states not working correctly
- Data not refreshing

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Check Loader Implementation**

```tsx
const route = createRoute({
  path: "/posts",
  loader: async ({ params, context }) => {
    console.log("Loader called with params:", params);

    try {
      const data = await fetchPosts();
      console.log("Loader data:", data);
      return data;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Loader error:", error);
      throw error;
    }
  },
  component: () => {
    const data = Route.useLoaderData();
    console.log("Component data:", data);

    return <div>{/* render data */}</div>;
  },
});
```

2. **Debug Loading States**

```tsx
function DataLoadingDebug() {
  const location = useLocation();

  console.log("Route status:", {
    isLoading: location.isLoading,
    isTransitioning: location.isTransitioning,
  });

  return null;
}
```

3. **Check Loader Dependencies**

```tsx
const route = createRoute({
  path: "/posts/$postId",
  loader: async ({ params }) => {
    // Loader will re-run when params change
    console.log("Loading post:", params.postId);
    return fetchPost(params.postId);
  },
  // Add dependencies for explicit re-loading
  loaderDeps: ({ search }) => ({
    refresh: search.refresh,
  }),
});
```

---

## Search Parameters Issues

### Problem: Search Params Not Updating

**Symptoms:**

- URL search params don't update
- `useSearch()` returns stale data
- Search validation errors

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Check Search Validation Schema**

```tsx
const route = createRoute({
  path: "/search",
  validateSearch: (search) => {
    console.log("Raw search params:", search);

    const validated = {
      q: (search.q as string) || "",
      page: Number(search.page) || 1,
    };

    console.log("Validated search params:", validated);
    return validated;
  },
  component: () => {
    const search = Route.useSearch();
    console.log("Component search:", search);

    return <div>Query: {search.q}</div>;
  },
});
```

2. **Debug Search Navigation**

```tsx
function SearchDebug() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const currentSearch = Route.useSearch();

  const updateSearch = (newSearch: any) => {
    console.log("Current search:", currentSearch);
    console.log("New search:", newSearch);

    navigate({
      to: ".",
      search: (prev) => {
        const updated = { ...prev, ...newSearch };
        console.log("Final search:", updated);
        return updated;
      },
    });
  };

  return <button onClick={() => updateSearch({ q: "test" })}>Update Search</button>;
}
```

---

## Performance Issues

### Problem: Excessive Re-renders

**Symptoms:**

- Components re-rendering too often
- Performance lag during navigation
- Memory usage increasing

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Use React DevTools Profiler**

```tsx
// Wrap your app for profiling
import { Profiler } from "react";

function App() {
  return (
    <Profiler
      id="Router"
      onRender={(id, phase, actualDuration) => {
        console.log(`${id} ${phase} took ${actualDuration}ms`);
      }}
    >
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
    </Profiler>
  );
}
```

2. **Optimize Route Subscriptions**

```tsx
// ❌ Subscribes to all search params
function MyComponent() {
  const search = Route.useSearch();
  return <div>{search.someSpecificField}</div>;
}

// ✅ Subscribe only to specific field
function MyComponent() {
  const someSpecificField = Route.useSearch({
    select: (search) => search.someSpecificField,
  });
  return <div>{someSpecificField}</div>;
}
```

3. **Monitor Route State Changes**

```tsx
// Add to router configuration
const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
  context: {
    /* ... */
  },
  onUpdate: (router) => {
    console.log("Router state updated:", {
      pathname: router.state.location.pathname,
      isLoading: router.state.isLoading,
      matches: router.state.matches.length,
    });
  },
});
```

### Problem: Memory Leaks

**Symptoms:**

- Memory usage constantly increasing
- Browser becomes slow over time
- Route components not cleaning up

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Check Component Cleanup**

```tsx
function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = someService.subscribe(setData);

    // ✅ Always clean up subscriptions
    return () => {
      subscription.unsubscribe();
    };
  }, []);

  return <div>{data}</div>;
}
```

2. **Monitor Route Unmounting**

```tsx
function DebuggableComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component mounted");

    return () => {
      console.log("Component unmounted");
    };
  }, []);

  return <div>Content</div>;
}
```

---

## TypeScript Issues

### Problem: Type Errors with Router

**Symptoms:**

- TypeScript errors in route definitions
- Type inference not working
- Parameter types incorrect

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Check Route Tree Type Registration**

```tsx
// Ensure this declaration exists
declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
  interface Register {
    router: typeof router;
  }
}
```

2. **Debug Route Type Generation**

```bash
# Check if route types are being generated
ls src/routeTree.gen.ts

# Regenerate route types if needed
npx @tanstack/router-cli generate
```

3. **Use Type Assertions for Debugging**

```tsx
function TypeDebugComponent() {
  const params = Route.useParams();
  const search = Route.useSearch();

  // Add type assertions to check what TypeScript infers
  console.log("Params type:", params as any);
  console.log("Search type:", search as any);

  return null;
}
```

---

## Systematic Debugging Process

### 1. Information Gathering

When debugging any router issue, start by collecting this information:

```tsx
function RouterDebugInfo() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const location = useLocation();

  useEffect(() => {
    console.group("🐛 Router Debug Info");
    console.log("Current pathname:", location.pathname);
    console.log("Search params:", location.search);
    console.log("Router state:", router.state);
    console.log("Active matches:", router.state.matches);
    console.log("Route tree:", router.routeTree);
    console.groupEnd();
  }, [location.pathname]);

  return null;
}

// Add to your app during debugging
<RouterDebugInfo />;
```

### 2. Isolation Testing

Create minimal reproduction:

```tsx
// Minimal route for testing
const testRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "/debug",
  component: () => {
    console.log("Test route rendered");
    return <div>Debug Route</div>;
  },
});

// Add to route tree temporarily
const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([
  // ... other routes
  testRoute, // Add test route
]);
```

### 3. Step-by-Step Debugging

1. **Verify basic setup** - Router provider, route tree structure
2. **Check route definitions** - Paths, parent routes, configuration
3. **Test navigation** - Links, programmatic navigation
4. **Validate data flow** - Loaders, search params, context
5. **Monitor performance** - Re-renders, memory usage

## Browser Debugging Tips

### Console Commands

```js
// In browser console (when router is on window)

// Current router state
router.state;

// Navigate programmatically
router.navigate({ to: "/some-path" });

// Get route by path
router.getRoute("/users/$userId");

// Check if route exists
router.buildLocation({ to: "/some-path" });

// View all registered routes
Object.keys(router.routesById);
```

### Network Tab

Monitor these requests when debugging:

- **Route code chunks** - Check if lazy routes are loading
- **Loader data requests** - Verify API calls from loaders
- **Failed requests** - Look for 404s or failed API calls

### React DevTools

1. **Components Tab** - Find router components and inspect props
2. **Profiler Tab** - Identify performance bottlenecks
3. **Search for components** - Find specific route components quickly

---

## Common Error Messages

### "Route not found"

- Check route path spelling and case sensitivity
- Verify route is added to route tree
- Ensure parent routes are properly configured

### "Cannot read property 'useParams' of undefined"

- Component is likely outside RouterProvider
- Route might not be properly registered
- Check if using correct Route object

### "Invalid search params"

- Check validateSearch schema
- Verify search param types match schema
- Look for required vs optional parameters

### "Navigation was interrupted"

- Usually caused by redirect in beforeLoad
- Check for redirect loops
- Verify authentication logic

---

## Performance Monitoring

### Enable Performance Tracking

```tsx
const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
  context: {
    /* ... */
  },
  onUpdate: (router) => {
    performance.mark("router-update");
  },
  onLoad: (router) => {
    performance.mark("router-load");
    performance.measure("router-load-time", "router-update", "router-load");
  },
});
```

### Monitor Route Loading Times

```tsx
const route = createRoute({
  path: "/slow-route",
  loader: async () => {
    const start = performance.now();
    const data = await fetchData();
    const end = performance.now();

    console.log(`Loader took ${end - start}ms`);
    return data;
  },
});
```

title: How to Deploy TanStack Router to Production
---

This guide covers deploying TanStack Router applications to popular hosting platforms.

## Quick Start

Single Page Applications (SPAs) need special server configuration to handle client-side routing. Configure your hosting platform to serve `index.html` for all routes, allowing TanStack Router to handle navigation.

---

## Netlify Deployment

### 1. Create `_redirects` File

Create a `public/_redirects` file (or `_redirects` in your build output):

```
/*    /index.html   200
```

### 2. Alternative: `netlify.toml`

Create a `netlify.toml` file in your project root:

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"
```

### 3. For TanStack Start (SSR)

```toml
[build]
  publish = ".output/public"
  command = "npm run build"

[functions]
  directory = ".output/server"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/server"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

---

## Cloudflare Pages

### 1. Create `_redirects` File

Create a `public/_redirects` file:

```
/*    /index.html   200
```

### 2. Alternative: `_routes.json`

Create a `public/_routes.json` file for more control:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "include": ["/*"],
  "exclude": ["/api/*"]
}
```

### 3. For TanStack Start (SSR)

Create `functions/_middleware.ts` for SSR support:

```ts
export const onRequest: PagesFunction = async (context) => {
  // Handle SSR requests
  return await handleSSR(context);
};
```

### 4. Deploy via Git

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Cloudflare Pages
2. Set build settings:
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Build output directory:** `dist`
   - **Root directory:** (leave empty)

### 5. Deploy via Wrangler CLI

```bash
# Install Wrangler
npm install -g wrangler

# Deploy
wrangler pages publish dist --project-name=my-app
```

---

## Vercel Deployment

### 1. Create `vercel.json`

Create a `vercel.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. For TanStack Start (SSR) Applications

If using TanStack Start with SSR, use this configuration instead:

```json
{
  "functions": {
    "app/server.ts": {
      "runtime": "nodejs18.x"
    }
  },
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/server"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Build Configuration

Ensure your `package.json` has the correct build script:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

### 4. Deploy

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel
```

---

## GitHub Pages

### 1. Create `404.html`

GitHub Pages requires a `404.html` file that duplicates `index.html`:

```bash
# After building
cp dist/index.html dist/404.html
```

### 2. Update `vite.config.js`

```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { tanstackRouter } from "@tanstack/router-plugin/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  base: "/your-repo-name/", // Replace with your repository name
  plugins: [
    tanstackRouter({
      target: "react",
      autoCodeSplitting: true,
    }),
    react(),
  ],
  build: {
    outDir: "dist",
  },
});
```

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "18"
          cache: "npm"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Create 404.html
        run: cp dist/index.html dist/404.html

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
```

---

## Firebase Hosting

### 1. Create `firebase.json`

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "dist",
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. Deploy

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login and initialize
firebase login
firebase init hosting

# Build and deploy
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

---

## Apache Server

Create a `.htaccess` file in your build output directory:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

---

## Nginx

Add this configuration to your Nginx server block:

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name your-domain.com;
  root /path/to/your/dist;
  index index.html;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
  }

  # Optional: Cache static assets
  location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg)$ {
    expires 1y;
    add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
  }
}
```

---

## Docker Deployment

### 1. Create `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### 2. Create `nginx.conf`

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
}
```

### 3. Build and Run

```bash
docker build -t my-tanstack-app .
docker run -p 80:80 my-tanstack-app
```

---

## Production Checklist

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- [ ] Created hosting platform configuration file
- [ ] Set correct base path if deploying to subdirectory
- [ ] Configured environment variables with `VITE_` prefix
- [ ] Tested all routes by direct URL access
- [ ] Verified static assets load correctly

---

## Common Problems

### 404 Errors on Page Refresh

**Problem:** Routes work when navigating within the app, but refreshing the page shows 404.

**Cause:** The server looks for files like `/about/index.html` which don't exist in SPAs.

**Solution:** Add the configuration files shown above for your hosting platform.

### App Works Locally But Breaks When Deployed

**Problem:** App works in development but shows errors in production.

**Solutions:**

- **Subdirectory deployment:** Configure base path in `vite.config.js`:
  ```js
  export default defineConfig({
    base: "/my-app/", // Match your deployment path
  });
  ```
- **Build output mismatch:** Ensure build directory matches hosting config:
  ```js
  export default defineConfig({
    build: {
      outDir: "dist", // Must match hosting platform setting
    },
  });
  ```
- **Environment variables:** Prefix with `VITE_` and rebuild:
  ```bash
  # .env
  VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
  ```

### Assets Not Loading (CSS/JS 404s)

**Problem:** App loads but styling is broken or JavaScript fails to load.

**Solutions:**

- Check build output directory in hosting configuration
- Verify public path configuration in Vite
- Ensure static file serving is properly configured

This guide covers setting up Chakra UI with TanStack Router, including theme configuration and creating responsive, accessible components.

## Quick Start

**Time Required:** 30-40 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Beginner to Intermediate  
**Prerequisites:** Existing TanStack Router project

### What You'll Accomplish

- Install and configure Chakra UI with TanStack Router
- Set up theme provider and custom theming
- Create type-safe router-compatible Chakra components
- Implement responsive navigation patterns
- Build accessible UI components with router integration

---

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Install Chakra UI Dependencies

```bash
npm install @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

### Step 2: Set Up Chakra Provider

```tsx
// src/components/chakra-provider.tsx
import { ChakraProvider, extendTheme, type ThemeConfig } from "@chakra-ui/react";
import { ReactNode } from "react";

// Extend the theme with custom colors and configurations
const config: ThemeConfig = {
  initialColorMode: "light",
  useSystemColorMode: true,
};

const theme = extendTheme({
  config,
  colors: {
    brand: {
      50: "#e3f2fd",
      100: "#bbdefb",
      200: "#90caf9",
      300: "#64b5f6",
      400: "#42a5f5",
      500: "#2196f3",
      600: "#1e88e5",
      700: "#1976d2",
      800: "#1565c0",
      900: "#0d47a1",
    },
  },
  fonts: {
    heading: "Inter, sans-serif",
    body: "Inter, sans-serif",
  },
  components: {
    Button: {
      defaultProps: {
        colorScheme: "brand",
      },
    },
    Link: {
      baseStyle: {
        _hover: {
          textDecoration: "none",
        },
      },
    },
  },
});

interface ChakraAppProviderProps {
  children: ReactNode;
}

export function ChakraAppProvider({ children }: ChakraAppProviderProps) {
  return <ChakraProvider theme={theme}>{children}</ChakraProvider>;
}
```

### Step 3: Update Root Route

```tsx
// src/routes/__root.tsx
import { createRootRoute, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from "@tanstack/router-devtools";
import { ChakraAppProvider } from "@/components/chakra-provider";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <ChakraAppProvider>
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </ChakraAppProvider>
  ),
});
```

---

## Creating Router-Compatible Components

### Step 1: Create Router-Compatible Chakra Components

```tsx
// src/components/ui/chakra-router-link.tsx
import { createLink } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { Link as ChakraLink, Button, IconButton } from "@chakra-ui/react";
import { forwardRef } from "react";

// Router-compatible Chakra Link
export const RouterLink = createLink(
  forwardRef<HTMLAnchorElement, any>((props, ref) => {
    return <ChakraLink ref={ref} {...props} />;
  }),
);

// Router-compatible Chakra Button
export const RouterButton = createLink(
  forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, any>((props, ref) => {
    return <Button ref={ref} as="button" {...props} />;
  }),
);

// Router-compatible Chakra IconButton
export const RouterIconButton = createLink(
  forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, any>((props, ref) => {
    return <IconButton ref={ref} as="button" {...props} />;
  }),
);
```

### Step 2: Create Navigation Components

```tsx
// src/components/navigation/chakra-nav.tsx
import { useMatchRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import {
  Box,
  Flex,
  HStack,
  IconButton,
  useDisclosure,
  useColorModeValue,
  Stack,
  Collapse,
} from "@chakra-ui/react";
import { HamburgerIcon, CloseIcon } from "@chakra-ui/icons";
import { RouterLink } from "@/components/ui/chakra-router-link";

interface NavItem {
  label: string;
  to: string;
  exact?: boolean;
}

interface ChakraNavProps {
  items: NavItem[];
  brand?: string;
  brandTo?: string;
}

export function ChakraNav({ items, brand = "Logo", brandTo = "/" }: ChakraNavProps) {
  const { isOpen, onToggle } = useDisclosure();
  const matchRoute = useMatchRoute();

  return (
    <Box>
      <Flex
        bg={useColorModeValue("white", "gray.800")}
        color={useColorModeValue("gray.600", "white")}
        minH="60px"
        py={{ base: 2 }}
        px={{ base: 4 }}
        borderBottom={1}
        borderStyle="solid"
        borderColor={useColorModeValue("gray.200", "gray.900")}
        align="center"
      >
        <Flex
          flex={{ base: 1, md: "auto" }}
          ml={{ base: -2 }}
          display={{ base: "flex", md: "none" }}
        >
          <IconButton
            onClick={onToggle}
            icon={isOpen ? <CloseIcon w={3} h={3} /> : <HamburgerIcon w={5} h={5} />}
            variant="ghost"
            aria-label="Toggle Navigation"
          />
        </Flex>

        <Flex flex={{ base: 1 }} justify={{ base: "center", md: "start" }}>
          <RouterLink
            to={brandTo}
            fontFamily="heading"
            fontWeight="bold"
            fontSize="xl"
            color={useColorModeValue("gray.800", "white")}
          >
            {brand}
          </RouterLink>

          <Flex display={{ base: "none", md: "flex" }} ml={10}>
            <DesktopNav items={items} />
          </Flex>
        </Flex>
      </Flex>

      <Collapse in={isOpen} animateOpacity>
        <MobileNav items={items} />
      </Collapse>
    </Box>
  );
}

function DesktopNav({ items }: { items: NavItem[] }) {
  const matchRoute = useMatchRoute();
  const linkColor = useColorModeValue("gray.600", "gray.200");
  const linkHoverColor = useColorModeValue("gray.800", "white");

  return (
    <HStack spacing={4}>
      {items.map((item) => {
        const isActive = matchRoute({ to: item.to, fuzzy: !item.exact });

        return (
          <RouterLink
            key={item.to}
            to={item.to}
            p={2}
            fontSize="sm"
            fontWeight={isActive ? "bold" : "medium"}
            color={isActive ? "brand.500" : linkColor}
            _hover={{
              textDecoration: "none",
              color: linkHoverColor,
            }}
          >
            {item.label}
          </RouterLink>
        );
      })}
    </HStack>
  );
}

function MobileNav({ items }: { items: NavItem[] }) {
  const matchRoute = useMatchRoute();

  return (
    <Stack bg={useColorModeValue("white", "gray.800")} p={4} display={{ md: "none" }}>
      {items.map((item) => {
        const isActive = matchRoute({ to: item.to, fuzzy: !item.exact });

        return (
          <RouterLink
            key={item.to}
            to={item.to}
            py={2}
            fontWeight={isActive ? "bold" : "medium"}
            color={isActive ? "brand.500" : useColorModeValue("gray.600", "gray.200")}
            _hover={{
              textDecoration: "none",
            }}
          >
            {item.label}
          </RouterLink>
        );
      })}
    </Stack>
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Create Breadcrumb Navigation

```tsx
// src/components/navigation/chakra-breadcrumb.tsx
import { useRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import {
  Breadcrumb,
  BreadcrumbItem,
  BreadcrumbLink,
  BreadcrumbSeparator,
} from "@chakra-ui/react";
import { ChevronRightIcon } from "@chakra-ui/icons";
import { RouterLink } from "@/components/ui/chakra-router-link";

interface BreadcrumbConfig {
  [key: string]: string;
}

interface ChakraBreadcrumbProps {
  config?: BreadcrumbConfig;
  separator?: React.ReactElement;
}

export function ChakraBreadcrumb({
  config = {},
  separator = <ChevronRightIcon color="gray.500" />,
}: ChakraBreadcrumbProps) {
  const router = useRouter();
  const pathSegments = router.state.location.pathname.split("/").filter(Boolean);

  if (pathSegments.length === 0) return null;

  const breadcrumbItems = pathSegments.map((segment, index) => {
    const path = "/" + pathSegments.slice(0, index + 1).join("/");
    const label = config[segment] || segment.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + segment.slice(1);
    const isLast = index === pathSegments.length - 1;

    return {
      path,
      label,
      isLast,
    };
  });

  return (
    <Breadcrumb spacing="8px" separator={separator}>
      <BreadcrumbItem>
        <BreadcrumbLink as={RouterLink} to="/">
          Home
        </BreadcrumbLink>
      </BreadcrumbItem>

      {breadcrumbItems.map(({ path, label, isLast }) => (
        <BreadcrumbItem key={path} isCurrentPage={isLast}>
          <BreadcrumbLink
            as={isLast ? "span" : RouterLink}
            to={isLast ? undefined : path}
            color={isLast ? "gray.500" : undefined}
          >
            {label}
          </BreadcrumbLink>
        </BreadcrumbItem>
      ))}
    </Breadcrumb>
  );
}
```

## Responsive Design Patterns

### Step 1: Create Responsive Layout Component

```tsx
// src/components/layout/chakra-layout.tsx
import { ReactNode } from "react";
import {
  Box,
  Container,
  Flex,
  useColorModeValue,
  VStack,
  useBreakpointValue,
} from "@chakra-ui/react";
import { ChakraNav } from "@/components/navigation/chakra-nav";
import { ChakraBreadcrumb } from "@/components/navigation/chakra-breadcrumb";

interface ChakraLayoutProps {
  children: ReactNode;
  showBreadcrumb?: boolean;
  maxWidth?: string;
}

const navItems = [
  { label: "Home", to: "/", exact: true },
  { label: "Posts", to: "/posts" },
  { label: "About", to: "/about" },
  { label: "Contact", to: "/contact" },
];

export function ChakraLayout({
  children,
  showBreadcrumb = true,
  maxWidth = "container.xl",
}: ChakraLayoutProps) {
  const containerPadding = useBreakpointValue({ base: 4, md: 6 });

  return (
    <Box minH="100vh" bg={useColorModeValue("gray.50", "gray.900")}>
      <ChakraNav items={navItems} brand="My App" />

      <Container maxW={maxWidth} py={containerPadding}>
        {showBreadcrumb && (
          <Box mb={6}>
            <ChakraBreadcrumb />
          </Box>
        )}

        <Box>{children}</Box>
      </Container>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Create Responsive Card Grid

```tsx
// src/components/ui/chakra-card-grid.tsx
import { ReactNode } from "react";
import { SimpleGrid, Box, useBreakpointValue } from "@chakra-ui/react";

interface ChakraCardGridProps {
  children: ReactNode;
  minChildWidth?: string;
  spacing?: number;
}

export function ChakraCardGrid({
  children,
  minChildWidth = "300px",
  spacing = 6,
}: ChakraCardGridProps) {
  const columns = useBreakpointValue({
    base: 1,
    md: 2,
    lg: 3,
    xl: 4,
  });

  return (
    <SimpleGrid columns={columns} spacing={spacing} minChildWidth={minChildWidth}>
      {children}
    </SimpleGrid>
  );
}
```

## Common Problems

### Theme Provider Issues

**Problem:** Chakra theme not applying correctly across routes.

**Solution:** Ensure ChakraProvider wraps the entire app at the root level:

```tsx
// ❌ Don't put provider inside individual routes
export const Route = createFileRoute("/some-route")({
  component: () => (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <SomeComponent />
    </ChakraProvider>
  ),
});

// ✅ Put provider at root level
export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <ChakraProvider>
      <Outlet />
    </ChakraProvider>
  ),
});
```

### TypeScript Errors with Router Integration

**Problem:** TypeScript errors when using Chakra components with TanStack Router.

**Solution:** Use proper typing with `createLink`:

```tsx
import { createLink } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { Button, type ButtonProps } from "@chakra-ui/react";
import { forwardRef } from "react";

// Properly typed router button
export const RouterButton = createLink(
  forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>((props, ref) => {
    return <Button ref={ref} as="button" {...props} />;
  }),
);
```

### Color Mode Persistence

**Problem:** Color mode doesn't persist across route changes.

**Solution:** Set up proper color mode manager:

```tsx
import { ColorModeScript } from "@chakra-ui/react";

// Add to your index.html head
<ColorModeScript initialColorMode={theme.config.initialColorMode} />;

// Or use localStorage manager
import { localStorageManager } from "@chakra-ui/react";
<ChakraProvider theme={theme} colorModeManager={localStorageManager}>
  {children}
</ChakraProvider>;
```

### Responsive Design Issues

**Problem:** Responsive breakpoints not working correctly.

**Solution:** Use Chakra's responsive utilities properly:

```tsx
// ✅ Use breakpoint values correctly
const columns = useBreakpointValue({
  base: 1,
  md: 2,
  lg: 3,
  xl: 4,
})

// ✅ Or use responsive props
<Box
  display={{ base: 'block', md: 'flex' }}
  flexDirection={{ base: 'column', md: 'row' }}
>
```

## Route Transition Animations

### Step 1: Create Animated Route Wrapper

```tsx
// src/components/animated-route.tsx
import { motion, type MotionProps, type Variants } from "framer-motion";
import { ReactNode } from "react";

interface AnimatedRouteProps extends MotionProps {
  children: ReactNode;
  variant?: "fade" | "slide" | "scale" | "slideUp";
}

const routeVariants: Record<string, Variants> = {
  fade: {
    initial: { opacity: 0 },
    in: { opacity: 1 },
    out: { opacity: 0 },
  },
  slide: {
    initial: { opacity: 0, x: -20 },
    in: { opacity: 1, x: 0 },
    out: { opacity: 0, x: 20 },
  },
  scale: {
    initial: { opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 },
    in: { opacity: 1, scale: 1 },
    out: { opacity: 0, scale: 1.05 },
  },
  slideUp: {
    initial: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
    in: { opacity: 1, y: 0 },
    out: { opacity: 0, y: -20 },
  },
};

const pageTransition = {
  type: "tween",
  ease: "anticipate",
  duration: 0.3,
};

export function AnimatedRoute({
  children,
  variant = "fade",
  ...motionProps
}: AnimatedRouteProps) {
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial="initial"
      animate="in"
      exit="out"
      variants={routeVariants[variant]}
      transition={pageTransition}
      {...motionProps}
    >
      {children}
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Set Up Route Animation Container

```tsx
// src/components/route-animation-container.tsx
import { useRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { AnimatePresence } from "framer-motion";
import { ReactNode } from "react";

interface RouteAnimationContainerProps {
  children: ReactNode;
}

export function RouteAnimationContainer({ children }: RouteAnimationContainerProps) {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <AnimatePresence mode="wait" initial={false}>
      <div key={router.state.location.pathname}>{children}</div>
    </AnimatePresence>
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Update Root Route for Animations

```tsx
// src/routes/__root.tsx
import { createRootRoute, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from "@tanstack/router-devtools";
import { RouteAnimationContainer } from "@/components/route-animation-container";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <RouteAnimationContainer>
        <Outlet />
      </RouteAnimationContainer>
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
});
```

### Step 4: Use Animations in Routes

```tsx
// src/routes/posts/index.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import { AnimatedRoute } from "@/components/animated-route";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/")({
  component: PostsPage,
});

function PostsPage() {
  return (
    <AnimatedRoute variant="slide">
      <div className="container mx-auto p-4">
        <motion.h1
          initial={{ opacity: 0, y: -20 }}
          animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
          transition={{ delay: 0.1 }}
          className="mb-6 text-3xl font-bold"
        >
          Posts
        </motion.h1>

        <motion.div
          initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
          animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
          transition={{ delay: 0.2 }}
          className="grid gap-4"
        >
          {/* Post cards with staggered animations */}
          {posts.map((post, index) => (
            <motion.div
              key={post.id}
              initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
              animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
              transition={{ delay: 0.3 + index * 0.1 }}
              className="rounded-lg border p-4"
            >
              <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">{post.title}</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-600">{post.excerpt}</p>
            </motion.div>
          ))}
        </motion.div>
      </div>
    </AnimatedRoute>
  );
}
```

## Animated Navigation Components

### Step 1: Create Animated Tab Navigation

```tsx
// src/components/navigation/animated-tabs.tsx
import { Link, useMatchRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

interface TabItem {
  to: string;
  label: string;
  exact?: boolean;
}

interface AnimatedTabsProps {
  items: TabItem[];
  className?: string;
}

export function AnimatedTabs({ items, className }: AnimatedTabsProps) {
  const matchRoute = useMatchRoute();

  return (
    <nav className={`flex space-x-1 rounded-lg bg-gray-100 p-2 ${className}`}>
      {items.map((item) => {
        const isActive = matchRoute({ to: item.to, fuzzy: !item.exact });

        return (
          <Link
            key={item.to}
            to={item.to}
            className={`relative rounded-md px-3 py-2 text-sm font-medium transition-colors ${
              isActive ? "text-blue-600" : "text-gray-600 hover:text-gray-900"
            }`}
          >
            {isActive && (
              <motion.div
                layoutId="activeTab"
                className="absolute inset-0 rounded-md bg-white shadow-sm"
                initial={false}
                transition={{
                  type: "spring",
                  bounce: 0.2,
                  duration: 0.6,
                }}
              />
            )}
            <span className="relative z-10">{item.label}</span>
          </Link>
        );
      })}
    </nav>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Create Sliding Mobile Menu

```tsx
// src/components/navigation/animated-mobile-menu.tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from "framer-motion";

interface MenuItem {
  to: string;
  label: string;
  icon?: React.ReactNode;
}

interface AnimatedMobileMenuProps {
  items: MenuItem[];
  trigger: React.ReactNode;
}

export function AnimatedMobileMenu({ items, trigger }: AnimatedMobileMenuProps) {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

  const menuVariants = {
    closed: {
      opacity: 0,
      x: "-100%",
      transition: {
        type: "spring",
        stiffness: 400,
        damping: 40,
      },
    },
    open: {
      opacity: 1,
      x: 0,
      transition: {
        type: "spring",
        stiffness: 400,
        damping: 40,
      },
    },
  };

  const itemVariants = {
    closed: { opacity: 0, x: -20 },
    open: { opacity: 1, x: 0 },
  };

  return (
    <>
      {/* Trigger */}
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}>{trigger}</button>

      {/* Overlay */}
      <AnimatePresence>
        {isOpen && (
          <motion.div
            initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
            animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
            exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
            className="bg-opacity-50 fixed inset-0 z-40 bg-black"
            onClick={() => setIsOpen(false)}
          />
        )}
      </AnimatePresence>

      {/* Menu */}
      <motion.nav
        initial="closed"
        animate={isOpen ? "open" : "closed"}
        variants={menuVariants}
        className="fixed top-0 left-0 z-50 h-full w-64 bg-white shadow-lg"
      >
        <div className="p-4">
          <motion.div
            initial="closed"
            animate={isOpen ? "open" : "closed"}
            transition={{ staggerChildren: 0.1, delayChildren: 0.2 }}
            className="space-y-2"
          >
            {items.map((item) => (
              <motion.div key={item.to} variants={itemVariants}>
                <Link
                  to={item.to}
                  className="flex items-center space-x-3 rounded-lg p-3 transition-colors hover:bg-gray-100"
                  onClick={() => setIsOpen(false)}

            ))}
          </motion.div>
        </div>
      </motion.nav>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Create Floating Action Button with Animations

```tsx
// src/components/navigation/animated-fab.tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import { Plus } from "lucide-react";

interface AnimatedFabProps {
  to: string;
  label?: string;
  icon?: React.ReactNode;
  className?: string;
}

export function AnimatedFab({
  to,
  label = "Add",
  icon = <Plus className="h-6 w-6" />,
  className = "",
}: AnimatedFabProps) {
  return (
    <motion.div
      whileHover={{ scale: 1.1 }}
      whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}
      className={`fixed right-6 bottom-6 ${className}`}
    >
      <Link
        to={to}
        className="flex items-center space-x-2 rounded-full bg-blue-600 px-6 py-3 text-white shadow-lg transition-colors hover:bg-blue-700"
      >
        <motion.div
          initial={{ rotate: 0 }}
          whileHover={{ rotate: 90 }}
          transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 300 }}
        >
          {icon}
        </motion.div>
        <span className="font-medium">{label}</span>
      </Link>
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

## Advanced Animation Patterns

### Step 1: Shared Element Transitions

```tsx
// src/components/animations/shared-element.tsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import { ReactNode } from "react";

interface SharedElementProps {
  layoutId: string;
  children: ReactNode;
  className?: string;
}

export function SharedElement({ layoutId, children, className }: SharedElementProps) {
  return (
    <motion.div
      layoutId={layoutId}
      className={className}
      transition={{
        type: "spring",
        stiffness: 300,
        damping: 30,
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </motion.div>
  );
}

// Usage in post list
function PostCard({ post }: { post: Post }) {
  return (
    <Link to="/posts/$postId" params={{ postId: post.id }}>
      <SharedElement layoutId={`post-${post.id}`}>
        <div className="rounded-lg border p-4">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">{post.title}</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600">{post.excerpt}</p>
        </div>
      </SharedElement>
    </Link>
  );
}

// Usage in post detail
function PostDetail({ post }: { post: Post }) {
  return (
    <SharedElement layoutId={`post-${post.id}`}>
      <div className="rounded-lg border p-6">
        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">{post.title}</h1>
        <div className="prose mt-4">{post.content}</div>
      </div>
    </SharedElement>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Route-Based Animation Variants

```tsx
// src/components/animations/route-variants.tsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import { useRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { ReactNode } from "react";

interface RouteVariantsProps {
  children: ReactNode;
}

export function RouteVariants({ children }: RouteVariantsProps) {
  const router = useRouter();
  const currentPath = router.state.location.pathname;

  // Different animations based on route depth
  const getVariants = (path: string) => {
    const depth = path.split("/").length - 1;

    if (depth === 1) {
      // Top-level routes slide from right
      return {
        initial: { opacity: 0, x: 100 },
        in: { opacity: 1, x: 0 },
        out: { opacity: 0, x: -100 },
      };
    } else if (depth === 2) {
      // Sub-routes slide up
      return {
        initial: { opacity: 0, y: 50 },
        in: { opacity: 1, y: 0 },
        out: { opacity: 0, y: -50 },
      };
    } else {
      // Deep routes fade
      return {
        initial: { opacity: 0 },
        in: { opacity: 1 },
        out: { opacity: 0 },
      };
    }
  };

  return (
    <motion.div
      key={currentPath}
      initial="initial"
      animate="in"
      exit="out"
      variants={getVariants(currentPath)}
      transition={{
        type: "spring",
        stiffness: 300,
        damping: 30,
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Loading Animations

```tsx
// src/components/animations/loading-animation.tsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

export function LoadingAnimation() {
  return (
    <div className="flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center">
      <motion.div
        className="flex space-x-2"
        initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
        animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
        exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
      >
        {[0, 1, 2].map((index) => (
          <motion.div
            key={index}
            className="h-3 w-3 rounded-full bg-blue-600"
            animate={{
              scale: [1, 1.2, 1],
              opacity: [1, 0.8, 1],
            }}
            transition={{
              duration: 1,
              repeat: Infinity,
              delay: index * 0.2,
            }}
          />
        ))}
      </motion.div>
    </div>
  );
}

// Usage in routes with loading states
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  component: PostPage,
  pendingComponent: LoadingAnimation,
});
```

## Complete Example

### App with Full Animation Integration

```tsx
// src/routes/posts/index.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import { AnimatedRoute } from "@/components/animated-route";
import { AnimatedTabs } from "@/components/navigation/animated-tabs";
import { AnimatedFab } from "@/components/navigation/animated-fab";
import { SharedElement } from "@/components/animations/shared-element";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/")({
  component: PostsPage,
});

const tabItems = [
  { to: "/posts", label: "All Posts", exact: true },
  { to: "/posts/published", label: "Published" },
  { to: "/posts/drafts", label: "Drafts" },
];

function PostsPage() {
  const posts = [
    { id: "1", title: "First Post", excerpt: "This is the first post" },
    { id: "2", title: "Second Post", excerpt: "This is the second post" },
  ];

  return (
    <AnimatedRoute variant="slide">
      <div className="container mx-auto p-4">
        {/* Animated header */}
        <motion.div
          initial={{ opacity: 0, y: -20 }}
          animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
          transition={{ delay: 0.1 }}
          className="mb-6"
        >
          <h1 className="mb-4 text-3xl font-bold">Posts</h1>
          <AnimatedTabs items={tabItems} />
        </motion.div>

        {/* Animated post grid */}
        <motion.div
          initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
          animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
          transition={{ delay: 0.2 }}
          className="grid gap-4"
        >
          {posts.map((post, index) => (
            <motion.div
              key={post.id}
              initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
              animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
              transition={{ delay: 0.3 + index * 0.1 }}
              whileHover={{ y: -2 }}
              className="cursor-pointer"
            >
              <SharedElement layoutId={`post-${post.id}`}>
                <div className="rounded-lg border p-4 transition-shadow hover:shadow-lg">
                  <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">{post.title}</h2>
                  <p className="text-gray-600">{post.excerpt}</p>
                </div>
              </SharedElement>
            </motion.div>
          ))}
        </motion.div>

        {/* Floating action button */}
        <AnimatedFab to="/posts/new" label="New Post" />
      </div>
    </AnimatedRoute>
  );
}
```

## Common Problems

### Animations Not Triggering

**Problem:** Route animations don't work or appear choppy.

**Solutions:**

1. **Ensure proper key for AnimatePresence:**

   ```tsx
   <AnimatePresence mode="wait">
     <motion.div key={router.state.location.pathname}>
       <Outlet />
     </motion.div>
   </AnimatePresence>
   ```

2. **Use layout animations correctly:**

   ```tsx
   // ❌ This might cause layout shifts
   <motion.div animate={{ x: 100 }}>

   // ✅ Use layout for changing layouts
   <motion.div layout>
   ```

### Performance Issues

**Problem:** Animations cause performance problems or jank.

**Solutions:**

1. **Prefer transform and opacity animations:**

   ```tsx
   // ✅ GPU-accelerated properties
   const variants = {
     initial: { opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 },
     in: { opacity: 1, scale: 1 },
   };

   // ❌ Avoid animating layout properties
   const badVariants = {
     initial: { width: 0, height: 0 },
     in: { width: "auto", height: "auto" },
   };
   ```

2. **Use will-change CSS property sparingly:**
   ```tsx
   <motion.div style={{ willChange: "transform" }} animate={{ x: 100 }} />
   ```

### Layout Shift Issues

**Problem:** Shared element transitions cause layout shifts.

**Solution:** Use layout animations and proper positioning:

```tsx
<motion.div
  layout
  layoutId="shared-element"
  style={{ position: "relative" }}
  transition={{
    layout: { duration: 0.3 },
  }}
>
  {children}
</motion.div>
```

title: How to Integrate TanStack Router with Material-UI (MUI)
---

This guide covers setting up Material-UI with TanStack Router, including proper TypeScript integration and component composition patterns.

## Quick Start

**Time Required:** 45-60 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Prerequisites:** Existing TanStack Router project

### What You'll Accomplish

- Install and configure Material-UI with TanStack Router
- Set up proper theme provider integration
- Create type-safe router-compatible MUI components
- Implement navigation with active state indicators
- Resolve common TypeScript and styling issues

---

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Install Material-UI Dependencies

```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material
```

**Optional: Add date picker support**

```bash
npm install @mui/x-date-pickers dayjs
```

### Step 2: Set Up Theme Provider

Create a theme provider that works with TanStack Router:

```tsx
// src/components/theme-provider.tsx
import { ThemeProvider, createTheme } from "@mui/material/styles";
import CssBaseline from "@mui/material/CssBaseline";
import { ReactNode } from "react";

const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    mode: "light",
    primary: {
      main: "#1976d2",
    },
    secondary: {
      main: "#dc004e",
    },
  },
  typography: {
    fontFamily: '"Roboto", "Helvetica", "Arial", sans-serif',
  },
  components: {
    // Customize components for router integration
    MuiButton: {
      styleOverrides: {
        root: {
          textTransform: "none", // More modern button styling
        },
      },
    },
    MuiLink: {
      styleOverrides: {
        root: {
          textDecoration: "none",
          "&:hover": {
            textDecoration: "underline",
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});

interface MuiThemeProviderProps {
  children: ReactNode;
}

export function MuiThemeProvider({ children }: MuiThemeProviderProps) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <CssBaseline />
      {children}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Update Root Route

Wrap your application with the MUI theme provider:

```tsx
// src/routes/__root.tsx
import { createRootRoute, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from "@tanstack/router-devtools";
import { MuiThemeProvider } from "@/components/theme-provider";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <MuiThemeProvider>
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </MuiThemeProvider>
  ),
});
```

---

## Creating Router-Compatible MUI Components

### Step 1: Create Typed MUI Link Component

MUI Link components require special handling for TanStack Router's type system:

```tsx
// src/components/ui/mui-router-link.tsx
import { createLink } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { Link as MuiLink, type LinkProps } from "@mui/material/Link";
import { forwardRef } from "react";

// Create a router-compatible MUI Link with full type safety
export const RouterLink = createLink(
  forwardRef<HTMLAnchorElement, LinkProps>((props, ref) => {
    return <MuiLink ref={ref} {...props} />;
  }),
);
```

### Step 2: Create Typed MUI Button Component

```tsx
// src/components/ui/mui-router-button.tsx
import { createLink } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { Button, type ButtonProps } from "@mui/material/Button";
import { forwardRef } from "react";

// Create a router-compatible MUI Button
export const RouterButton = createLink(
  forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>((props, ref) => {
    return <Button ref={ref} component="button" {...props} />;
  }),
);
```

### Step 3: Create Advanced Navigation Components

```tsx
// src/components/ui/mui-router-fab.tsx
import { createLink } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { Fab, type FabProps } from "@mui/material/Fab";
import { forwardRef } from "react";

// Router-compatible Floating Action Button
export const RouterFab = createLink(
  forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, FabProps>((props, ref) => {
    return <Fab ref={ref} {...props} />;
  }),
);
```

## Implementing Navigation with Active States

### Step 1: Create Navigation Tabs with Active States

```tsx
// src/components/navigation/mui-nav-tabs.tsx
import { useMatchRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { Tabs, Tab, type TabsProps } from "@mui/material";
import { RouterLink } from "@/components/ui/mui-router-link";

interface NavTab {
  label: string;
  to: string;
  value: string;
  icon?: React.ReactNode;
}

interface MuiNavTabsProps extends Omit<TabsProps, "value" | "onChange"> {
  tabs: NavTab[];
}

export function MuiNavTabs({ tabs, ...tabsProps }: MuiNavTabsProps) {
  const matchRoute = useMatchRoute();

  // Find active tab based on current route
  const activeTab =
    tabs.find((tab) => matchRoute({ to: tab.to, fuzzy: true }))?.value || false;

  return (
    <Tabs value={activeTab} {...tabsProps}>
      {tabs.map((tab) => (
        <Tab
          key={tab.value}
          label={tab.label}
          value={tab.value}
          icon={tab.icon}
          component={RouterLink}
          to={tab.to}
          sx={{
            "&.Mui-selected": {
              fontWeight: "bold",
            },
          }}
        />
      ))}
    </Tabs>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Create Navigation Drawer

```tsx
// src/components/navigation/mui-nav-drawer.tsx
import { useMatchRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import {
  Drawer,
  List,
  ListItem,
  ListItemButton,
  ListItemIcon,
  ListItemText,
  Typography,
  Box,
  type DrawerProps,
} from "@mui/material";
import { RouterLink } from "@/components/ui/mui-router-link";

interface DrawerItem {
  label: string;
  to: string;
  icon?: React.ReactNode;
}

interface MuiNavDrawerProps extends Omit<DrawerProps, "children"> {
  items: DrawerItem[];
  title?: string;
}

export function MuiNavDrawer({ items, title, ...drawerProps }: MuiNavDrawerProps) {
  const matchRoute = useMatchRoute();

  return (
    <Drawer {...drawerProps}>
      <Box sx={{ width: 250 }} role="presentation">
        {title && (
          <Typography variant="h6" sx={{ p: 2, borderBottom: 1, borderColor: "divider" }}>
            {title}
          </Typography>
        )}

        <List>
          {items.map((item) => {
            const isActive = matchRoute({ to: item.to, fuzzy: true });

            return (
              <ListItem key={item.to} disablePadding>
                <ListItemButton
                  component={RouterLink}
                  to={item.to}
                  selected={isActive}
                  sx={{
                    "&.Mui-selected": {
                      backgroundColor: "primary.main",
                      color: "primary.contrastText",
                      "&:hover": {
                        backgroundColor: "primary.dark",
                      },
                    },
                  }}
                >
                  {item.icon && <ListItemIcon>{item.icon}</ListItemIcon>}
                  <ListItemText primary={item.label} />
                </ListItemButton>
              </ListItem>
            );
          })}
        </List>
      </Box>
    </Drawer>
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Create App Bar with Navigation

```tsx
// src/components/navigation/mui-app-bar.tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import {
  AppBar,
  Toolbar,
  Typography,
  IconButton,
  Menu,
  MenuItem,
  Box,
} from "@mui/material";
import { Menu as MenuIcon, AccountCircle } from "@mui/icons-material";
import { RouterButton, RouterLink } from "@/components/ui/mui-router-link";
import { MuiNavDrawer } from "./mui-nav-drawer";

interface AppBarItem {
  label: string;
  to: string;
  icon?: React.ReactNode;
}

interface MuiAppBarProps {
  title: string;
  navigationItems: AppBarItem[];
  userMenuItems?: AppBarItem[];
}

export function MuiAppBar({ title, navigationItems, userMenuItems }: MuiAppBarProps) {
  const [drawerOpen, setDrawerOpen] = useState(false);
  const [userMenuAnchor, setUserMenuAnchor] = useState<null | HTMLElement>(null);

  const handleUserMenuClick = (event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLElement>) => {
    setUserMenuAnchor(event.currentTarget);
  };

  const handleUserMenuClose = () => {
    setUserMenuAnchor(null);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <AppBar position="static">
        <Toolbar>
          <IconButton
            edge="start"
            color="inherit"
            onClick={() => setDrawerOpen(true)}
            sx={{ mr: 2 }}
          >
            <MenuIcon />
          </IconButton>

          <Typography variant="h6" component="div" sx={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>
            <RouterLink to="/" color="inherit" underline="none">
              {title}
            </RouterLink>
          </Typography>

          {/* Desktop Navigation */}
          <Box sx={{ display: { xs: "none", md: "flex" }, mr: 2 }}>
            {navigationItems.map((item) => (
              <RouterButton
                key={item.to}
                to={item.to}
                color="inherit"
                startIcon={item.icon}
                sx={{ ml: 1 }}
              >
                {item.label}
              </RouterButton>
            ))}
          </Box>

          {/* User Menu */}
          {userMenuItems && (
            <>
              <IconButton color="inherit" onClick={handleUserMenuClick}>
                <AccountCircle />
              </IconButton>
              <Menu
                anchorEl={userMenuAnchor}
                open={Boolean(userMenuAnchor)}
                onClose={handleUserMenuClose}
              >
                {userMenuItems.map((item) => (
                  <MenuItem
                    key={item.to}
                    component={RouterLink}
                    to={item.to}
                    onClick={handleUserMenuClose}
                  >
                    {item.label}
                  </MenuItem>
                ))}

```tsx
// src/routes/posts/$postId.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import {
  Container,
  Typography,
  Box,
  Card,
  CardContent,
  CardActions,
  Chip,
  Stack,
} from "@mui/material";
import { Edit, Delete, ArrowBack } from "@mui/icons-material";
import { RouterButton, RouterLink } from "@/components/ui/mui-router-link";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  component: PostPage,
});

function PostPage() {
  const { postId } = Route.useParams();

  return (
    <Container maxWidth="md" sx={{ py: 4 }}>
      {/* Breadcrumb Navigation */}
      <Box sx={{ mb: 3 }}>
        <RouterLink
          to="/posts"

        title="My App"
        navigationItems={navigationItems}
        userMenuItems={userMenuItems}
      />

      <Box component="main" sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
        <Outlet />
      </Box>
    </Box>
  );
}
```

## Common Problems

### TypeScript Errors with Component Props

**Problem:** TypeScript errors when using MUI components with TanStack Router props.

**Solution:** Always use `createLink` for proper typing:

```tsx
// ❌ This will cause TypeScript errors
const BadButton = (props: any) => <Button {...props} />;

// ✅ This provides full type safety
export const RouterButton = createLink(
  forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>((props, ref) => {
    return <Button ref={ref} component="button" {...props} />;
  }),
);
```

### Styling Conflicts

**Problem:** MUI styles conflict with other libraries or custom styles.

**Solutions:**

1. **Use MUI's emotion cache:**

   ```tsx
   import { CacheProvider } from "@emotion/react";
   import createCache from "@emotion/cache";

   const cache = createCache({
     key: "mui",
     prepend: true,
   });

   export function App() {
     return (
       <CacheProvider value={cache}>
         <MuiThemeProvider>{/* Your app */}</MuiThemeProvider>
       </CacheProvider>
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Increase CSS specificity:**
   ```tsx
   const StyledButton = styled(Button)(({ theme }) => ({
     "&.router-active": {
       backgroundColor: theme.palette.primary.main,
       color: theme.palette.primary.contrastText,
     },
   }));
   ```

### Theme Not Applied Correctly

**Problem:** MUI theme changes don't apply to router-created components.

**Solution:** Ensure theme provider wraps the entire app:

```tsx
// ❌ Theme provider inside routes won't work for navigation
export const Route = createFileRoute("/some-route")({
  component: () => (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <SomeComponent />
    </ThemeProvider>
  ),
});

// ✅ Theme provider at root level
export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Outlet />
    </ThemeProvider>
  ),
});
```

### Performance Issues with Large Apps

**Problem:** Bundle size or runtime performance issues.

**Solutions:**

1. **Use tree shaking:**

   ```tsx
   // ✅ Import only what you need
   import Button from "@mui/material/Button";
   import TextField from "@mui/material/TextField";

   // ❌ Avoid importing everything
   import { Button, TextField } from "@mui/material";
   ```

2. **Use dynamic imports for heavy components:**

   ```tsx
   import { lazy, Suspense } from "react";
   import { CircularProgress } from "@mui/material";

   const DataGrid = lazy(() =>
     import("@mui/x-data-grid").then((module) => ({
       default: module.DataGrid,
     })),
   );

   function MyComponent() {
     return (
       <Suspense fallback={<CircularProgress />}>
         <DataGrid {...props} />
       </Suspense>
     );
   }
   ```

npx shadcn@latest init
```

### Step 2: Configure components.json

Create or update your `components.json` for TanStack Router compatibility:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
  "style": "default",
  "rsc": false,
  "tsx": true,
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.js",
    "css": "src/app/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "slate",
    "cssVariables": true
  },

Install the most commonly used components:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
npx shadcn@latest add navigation-menu
npx shadcn@latest add sheet
npx shadcn@latest add dialog
```

---

## Fixing Animation Issues

### Step 1: Set Up Proper DOM Structure

Update your root route to support portals and animations:

```tsx
// src/routes/__root.tsx
import { createRootRoute, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from "@tanstack/react-router-devtools";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      {/* Main content wrapper */}
      <div id="root-content">
        <Outlet />
      </div>

      {/* Portal root for overlays */}
      <div id="portal-root"></div>

      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
});
```

### Step 2: Create Router-Compatible Sheet Component

Shadcn/ui Sheet components can have animation issues. Create a wrapper:

```tsx
// src/components/ui/router-sheet.tsx
import * as React from "react";
import {
  Sheet,
  SheetContent,
  SheetDescription,
  SheetHeader,
  SheetTitle,
  SheetTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/sheet";

interface RouterSheetProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  trigger: React.ReactNode;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  onOpenChange?: (open: boolean) => void;
}

export function RouterSheet({
  children,
  trigger,
  title,
  description,
  onOpenChange,
}: RouterSheetProps) {
  const [open, setOpen] = React.useState(false);

  const handleOpenChange = (newOpen: boolean) => {
    setOpen(newOpen);
    onOpenChange?.(newOpen);
  };

  return (
    <Sheet open={open} onOpenChange={handleOpenChange}>
      <SheetTrigger asChild>{trigger}</SheetTrigger>
      <SheetContent>
        <SheetHeader>
          <SheetTitle>{title}</SheetTitle>
          {description && <SheetDescription>{description}</SheetDescription>}
        </SheetHeader>
        <div className="mt-4">{children}</div>
      </SheetContent>
    </Sheet>
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Create Router-Compatible Dialog Component

```tsx
// src/components/ui/router-dialog.tsx
import * as React from "react";
import {
  Dialog,
  DialogContent,
  DialogDescription,
  DialogHeader,
  DialogTitle,
  DialogTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/dialog";

interface RouterDialogProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  trigger: React.ReactNode;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  open?: boolean;
  onOpenChange?: (open: boolean) => void;
}

export function RouterDialog({
  children,
  trigger,
  title,
  description,
  open: controlledOpen,
  onOpenChange,
}: RouterDialogProps) {
  const [internalOpen, setInternalOpen] = React.useState(false);

  const open = controlledOpen ?? internalOpen;
  const setOpen = onOpenChange ?? setInternalOpen;

  return (
    <Dialog open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen}>
      <DialogTrigger asChild>{trigger}</DialogTrigger>
      <DialogContent>
        <DialogHeader>
          <DialogTitle>{title}</DialogTitle>
          {description && <DialogDescription>{description}</DialogDescription>}
        </DialogHeader>
        <div className="mt-4">{children}</div>
      </DialogContent>
    </Dialog>
  );
}
```

---

## Creating Navigation Components

### Step 1: Router-Compatible Navigation Menu

```tsx
// src/components/navigation/main-nav.tsx
import { Link, useMatchRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";
import {
  NavigationMenu,
  NavigationMenuItem,
  NavigationMenuLink,
  NavigationMenuList,
  navigationMenuTriggerStyle,
} from "@/components/ui/navigation-menu";

interface NavItem {
  to: string;
  label: string;
  exact?: boolean;
}

interface MainNavProps {
  items: NavItem[];
  className?: string;
}

export function MainNav({ items, className }: MainNavProps) {
  const matchRoute = useMatchRoute();

  return (
    <NavigationMenu className={className}>
      <NavigationMenuList>
        {items.map((item) => {
          const isActive = matchRoute({ to: item.to, fuzzy: !item.exact });

          return (
            <NavigationMenuItem key={item.to}>
              <Link
                to={item.to}
                className={cn(
                  navigationMenuTriggerStyle(),
                  isActive && "bg-accent text-accent-foreground font-medium",
                )}
              >
                {item.label}
              </Link>
            </NavigationMenuItem>
          );
        })}
      </NavigationMenuList>
    </NavigationMenu>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Create Router-Compatible Button Links

```tsx
// src/components/ui/router-button.tsx
import { createLink } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { Button, type ButtonProps } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { forwardRef } from "react";

// Create a router-compatible Button
export const RouterButton = createLink(
  forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>((props, ref) => {
    return <Button ref={ref} {...props} />;
  }),
);
```

### Step 3: Usage Example

```tsx
// src/routes/posts/index.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { MainNav } from "@/components/navigation/main-nav";
import { RouterButton } from "@/components/ui/router-button";
import { RouterSheet } from "@/components/ui/router-sheet";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/")({
  component: PostsPage,
});

const navItems = [
  { to: "/", label: "Home" },
  { to: "/posts", label: "Posts", exact: true },
  { to: "/about", label: "About" },
];

function PostsPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto p-4">
      {/* Navigation with active states */}
      <MainNav items={navItems} className="mb-8" />

      <div className="mb-6 flex items-center justify-between">
        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Posts</h1>

        {/* Router-compatible button */}
        <RouterButton to="/posts/new" variant="default">
          Create Post
        </RouterButton>
      </div>

      {/* Sheet with proper animations */}
      <RouterSheet
        trigger={<Button variant="outline">Open Menu</Button>}
        title="Navigation Menu"
        description="Navigate through your posts"
      >
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <p>This sheet animates correctly with TanStack Router!</p>
          <RouterButton to="/posts/new" variant="default" className="w-full">
            Create New Post
          </RouterButton>
        </div>
      </RouterSheet>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

## Common Problems

### Animation Components Not Working

**Problem:** Sheet, Dialog, or other animated components don't animate properly.

**Solutions:**

1. **Ensure proper portal setup:**

   ```tsx
   // Add to your index.html or root component
   <div id="portal-root"></div>
   ```

2. **Check CSS imports order:**

   ```css
   /* Make sure this comes before your custom styles */
   @import "tailwindcss/base";
   @import "tailwindcss/components";
   @import "tailwindcss/utilities";
   ```

3. **Use controlled components for complex animations:**

   ```tsx
   const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)

   // Controlled instead of uncontrolled
   <Sheet open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen}>
   ```

### TypeScript Errors with Router Integration

**Problem:** TypeScript errors when using Shadcn/ui components with TanStack Router.

**Solution:** Use `createLink` for proper typing:

```tsx
import { createLink } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

// This provides full type safety
export const RouterButton = createLink(Button);
```

### Styling Conflicts

**Problem:** Shadcn/ui styles conflict with router or custom styles.

**Solutions:**

1. **Use CSS layers:**

   ```css
   @layer base, components, utilities;

   @layer base {
     /* Shadcn/ui base styles */
   }

   @layer components {
     /* Your component styles */
   }
   ```

2. **Increase specificity for router-specific styles:**
   ```tsx
   <Button className="router-active:bg-primary router-active:text-primary-foreground">
     Active Button
   </Button>
   ```

### Dark Mode Integration

**Problem:** Dark mode doesn't work properly with route changes.

**Solution:** Set up theme provider correctly:

```tsx
// src/components/theme-provider.tsx
import { createContext, useContext, useEffect, useState } from "react";

type Theme = "dark" | "light" | "system";

interface ThemeProviderProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  defaultTheme?: Theme;
  storageKey?: string;
}

const ThemeProviderContext = createContext<{
  theme: Theme;
  setTheme: (theme: Theme) => void;
}>({
  theme: "system",
  setTheme: () => null,
});

export function ThemeProvider({
  children,
  defaultTheme = "system",
  storageKey = "ui-theme",
}: ThemeProviderProps) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<Theme>(
    () => (localStorage.getItem(storageKey) as Theme) || defaultTheme,
  );

  useEffect(() => {
    const root = window.document.documentElement;
    root.classList.remove("light", "dark");

    if (theme === "system") {
      const systemTheme = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches
        ? "dark"
        : "light";
      root.classList.add(systemTheme);
      return;
    }

    root.classList.add(theme);
  }, [theme]);

  const value = {
    theme,
    setTheme: (theme: Theme) => {
      localStorage.setItem(storageKey, theme);
      setTheme(theme);
    },
  };

  return (
    <ThemeProviderContext.Provider value={value}>
      {children}
    </ThemeProviderContext.Provider>
  );
}

export const useTheme = () => {
  const context = useContext(ThemeProviderContext);
  if (context === undefined)
    throw new Error("useTheme must be used within a ThemeProvider");
  return context;
};
```

title: How to Migrate from React Router v7
---

This guide provides a step-by-step process to migrate your application from React Router v7 to TanStack Router. We'll cover the complete migration process from removing React Router dependencies to implementing TanStack Router's type-safe routing patterns.

## Quick Start

**Time Required:** 2-4 hours depending on app complexity  
**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Prerequisites:** Basic React knowledge, existing React Router v7 app

### What You'll Accomplish

- Remove React Router v7 dependencies and components
- Install and configure TanStack Router
- Convert route definitions to file-based routing
- Update navigation components and hooks
- Implement type-safe routing patterns
- Handle search params and dynamic routes
- Migrate from React Router v7's new features to TanStack Router equivalents

---

## Complete Migration Process

### Step 1: Prepare for Migration

Before making any changes, prepare your environment and codebase:

**1.1 Create a backup branch**

```bash
git checkout -b migrate-to-tanstack-router
git push -u origin migrate-to-tanstack-router
```

**1.2 Install TanStack Router (keep React Router temporarily)**

```bash
# Install TanStack Router
npm install @tanstack/react-router

# Install development dependencies
npm install -D @tanstack/router-plugin @tanstack/react-router-devtools
```

**1.3 Set up the router plugin for your bundler**

For **Vite** users, update your `vite.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { tanstackRouter } from "@tanstack/router-plugin/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tanstackRouter(), // Add this before react plugin
    react(),
  ],
});
```

For **other bundlers**, see our [bundler configuration guides](../routing/).

### Step 2: Create TanStack Router Configuration

**2.1 Create router configuration file**

Create `tsr.config.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "routesDirectory": "./src/routes",
  "generatedRouteTree": "./src/routeTree.gen.ts",
  "quoteStyle": "single"
}
```

**2.2 Create routes directory**

```bash
mkdir src/routes
```

### Step 3: Convert Your React Router v7 Structure

**3.1 Identify your current React Router v7 setup**

React Router v7 introduced several new patterns. Look for:

- `createBrowserRouter` with new data APIs
- Framework mode configurations
- Server-side rendering setup
- New `loader` and `action` functions
- `defer` usage (simplified in v7)
- Type-safe routing features

**3.2 Create root route**

Create `src/routes/__root.tsx`:

```typescript
import { createRootRoute, Link, Outlet } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-router-devtools'

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      {/* Your existing layout/navbar content */}
      <div className="p-2 flex gap-2">
        <Link to="/" className="[&.active]:font-bold">
          Home
        </Link>
        <Link to="/about" className="[&.active]:font-bold">
          About
        </Link>
      </div>
      <hr />
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
})
```

**3.3 Create index route**

Create `src/routes/index.tsx` for your home page:

```typescript
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/')({
  component: Index,
})

function Index() {
  return (
    <div className="p-2">
      <h3>Welcome Home!</h3>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**3.4 Convert React Router v7 loaders**

React Router v7 simplified loader patterns. Here's how to migrate them:

**React Router v7:**

```typescript
// app/routes/posts.tsx
export async function loader() {
  const posts = await fetchPosts()
  return { posts } // v7 removed need for json() wrapper
}

export default function Posts() {
  const { posts } = useLoaderData()
  return <div>{/* render posts */}</div>
}
```

**TanStack Router equivalent:**
Create `src/routes/posts.tsx`:

```typescript
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/posts')({
  loader: async () => {
    const posts = await fetchPosts()
    return { posts }
  },
  component: Posts,
})

function Posts() {
  const { posts } = Route.useLoaderData()
  return <div>{/* render posts */}</div>
}
```

**3.5 Convert dynamic routes**

**React Router v7:**

```typescript
// app/routes/posts.$postId.tsx
export async function loader({ params }) {
  const post = await fetchPost(params.postId)
  return { post }
}

export default function Post() {
  const { post } = useLoaderData()
  return <div>{post.title}</div>
}
```

**TanStack Router equivalent:**
Create `src/routes/posts/$postId.tsx`:

```typescript
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/posts/$postId')({
  loader: async ({ params }) => {
    const post = await fetchPost(params.postId)
    return { post }
  },
  component: Post,
})

function Post() {
  const { post } = Route.useLoaderData()
  const { postId } = Route.useParams()
  return <div>{post.title}</div>
}
```

**3.6 Convert React Router v7 actions**

**React Router v7:**

```typescript
export async function action({ request, params }) {
  const formData = await request.formData();
  const result = await updatePost(params.postId, formData);
  return { success: true };
}
```

**TanStack Router equivalent:**

```typescript
export const Route = createFileRoute('/posts/$postId/edit')({
  component: EditPost,
  // Actions are typically handled differently in TanStack Router
  // Use mutations or form libraries like React Hook Form
})

function EditPost() {
  const navigate = useNavigate()

  const handleSubmit = async (formData) => {
    const result = await updatePost(params.postId, formData)
    navigate({ to: '/posts/$postId', params: { postId } })
  }

  return <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>{/* form */}</form>
}
```

### Step 4: Handle React Router v7 Framework Features

**4.1 Server-Side Rendering Migration**

React Router v7 introduced framework mode with SSR. If you're using this:

**React Router v7 Framework Mode:**

```typescript
// react-router.config.ts
export default {
  ssr: true,
  prerender: ["/"],
};
```

**TanStack Router approach:**

TanStack Router has built-in SSR capabilities. Set up your router for SSR:

```typescript
// src/router.tsx
import { createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
  context: {
    // Add any SSR context here
  },
});

declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
  interface Register {
    router: typeof router;
  }
}

export { router };
```

For server-side rendering, use TanStack Router's built-in SSR APIs:

```typescript
// server.tsx
import { createMemoryHistory } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { StartServer } from '@tanstack/start/server'

export async function render(url: string) {
  const router = createRouter({
    routeTree,
    history: createMemoryHistory({ initialEntries: [url] }),
  })

  await router.load()

  return (
    <StartServer router={router} />
  )
}
```

**4.2 Code Splitting Migration**

React Router v7 improved code splitting. TanStack Router handles this via lazy routes:

**React Router v7:**

```typescript
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import("./LazyComponent"));
```

**TanStack Router:**

```typescript
import { createLazyFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createLazyFileRoute('/lazy-route')({
  component: LazyComponent,
})

function LazyComponent() {
  return <div>Lazy loaded!</div>
}
```

### Step 5: Update Navigation Components

**5.1 Update Link components**

**React Router v7:**

```typescript
import { Link } from 'react-router'

<Link to="/posts/123">View Post</Link>
<Link to="/posts" state={{ from: 'home' }}>Posts</Link>
```

**TanStack Router:**

```typescript
import { Link } from '@tanstack/react-router'

<Link to="/posts/$postId" params={{ postId: '123' }}>View Post</Link>
<Link to="/posts" state={{ from: 'home' }}>Posts</Link>
```

**5.2 Update navigation hooks**

**React Router v7:**

```typescript
import { useNavigate } from "react-router";

function Component() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleClick = () => {
    navigate("/posts/123");
  };
}
```

**TanStack Router:**

```typescript
import { useNavigate } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function Component() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleClick = () => {
    navigate({ to: "/posts/$postId", params: { postId: "123" } });
  };
}
```

### Step 6: Handle React Router v7 Specific Features

**6.1 Migrate simplified `defer` usage**

React Router v7 simplified defer by removing the wrapper function:

**React Router v7:**

```typescript
export async function loader() {
  return {
    data: fetchData(), // Promise directly returned
  };
}
```

**TanStack Router:**

TanStack Router uses a different approach for deferred data. Use loading states:

```typescript
export const Route = createFileRoute('/deferred')({
  loader: async () => {
    const data = await fetchData()
    return { data }
  },
  pendingComponent: () => <div>Loading...</div>,
  component: DeferredComponent,
})
```

**6.2 Handle React Router v7's enhanced type safety**

React Router v7 improved type inference. TanStack Router provides even better type safety:

```typescript
// TanStack Router automatically infers types
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  loader: async ({ params }) => {
    // params.postId is automatically typed as string
    const post = await fetchPost(params.postId);
    return { post };
  },
  component: Post,
});

function Post() {
  // post is automatically typed based on loader return
  const { post } = Route.useLoaderData();
  // postId is automatically typed as string
  const { postId } = Route.useParams();
}
```

### Step 7: Update Your Main Router Setup

**7.1 Replace React Router v7 router creation**

**Before (React Router v7):**

```typescript
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from 'react-router'

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  // Your route definitions
])

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

**After (TanStack Router):**

```typescript
import { RouterProvider } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { router } from './router'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

### Step 8: Handle Search Parameters

**8.1 React Router v7 to TanStack Router search params**

**React Router v7:**

```typescript
import { useSearchParams } from "react-router";

function Component() {
  const [searchParams, setSearchParams] = useSearchParams();
  const page = searchParams.get("page") || "1";

  const updatePage = (newPage) => {
    setSearchParams({ page: newPage });
  };
}
```

**TanStack Router:**

```typescript
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { z } from "zod";

const searchSchema = z.object({
  page: z.number().catch(1),
  filter: z.string().optional(),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  validateSearch: searchSchema,
  component: Posts,
});

function Posts() {
  const navigate = useNavigate({ from: "/posts" });
  const { page, filter } = Route.useSearch();

  const updatePage = (newPage: number) => {
    navigate({ search: (prev) => ({ ...prev, page: newPage }) });
  };
}
```

### Step 9: Remove React Router Dependencies

Only after everything is working with TanStack Router:

**9.1 Remove React Router v7**

```bash
npm uninstall react-router
```

**9.2 Clean up unused imports**

Search your codebase for any remaining React Router imports:

```bash
# Find remaining React Router imports
grep -r "react-router" src/
```

Remove any remaining imports and replace with TanStack Router equivalents.

### Step 10: Add Advanced Type Safety

**10.1 Configure strict TypeScript**

Update your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true
  }
}
```

**10.2 Add search parameter validation**

For routes with search parameters, add validation schemas:

```typescript
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { z } from "zod";

const postsSearchSchema = z.object({
  page: z.number().min(1).catch(1),
  search: z.string().optional(),
  category: z.enum(["tech", "business", "lifestyle"]).optional(),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  validateSearch: postsSearchSchema,
  component: Posts,
});
```

## Common Problems

### Error: "Cannot use useNavigate outside of context"

**Problem:** You have remaining React Router imports that conflict with TanStack Router.

**Solution:**

1. Search for all React Router imports:
   ```bash
   grep -r "react-router" src/
   ```
2. Replace all imports with TanStack Router equivalents
3. Ensure React Router is completely uninstalled

### TypeScript Errors: Route Parameters

**Problem:** TypeScript showing errors about route parameters not being typed correctly.

**Solution:**

1. Ensure your router is registered in the TypeScript module declaration:
   ```typescript
   declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
     interface Register {
       router: typeof router;
     }
   }
   ```
2. Check that your route files export the Route correctly
3. Verify parameter names match between route definition and usage

### React Router v7 Framework Features Not Working

**Problem:** Missing SSR or code splitting functionality after migration.

**Solution:**

1. TanStack Router has built-in SSR capabilities - use TanStack Start for full-stack applications
2. Use TanStack Router's lazy routes for code splitting
3. Configure SSR using TanStack Router's native APIs
4. Follow the [SSR setup guide](./setup-ssr.md) for detailed instructions

### Routes Not Matching

**Problem:** Routes not rendering or 404 errors for valid routes.

**Solution:**

1. Check file naming follows TanStack Router conventions:
   - Dynamic routes: `$paramName.tsx`
   - Index routes: `index.tsx`
   - Nested routes: proper directory structure
2. Verify route tree generation is working
3. Check that the router plugin is properly configured

### React Router v7 Simplified APIs Not Translating

**Problem:** v7's simplified `defer` or other features don't have direct equivalents.

**Solution:**

1. Use TanStack Router's pending states for loading UX
2. Implement data fetching patterns that fit TanStack Router's architecture
3. Leverage TanStack Router's superior type safety for better DX

title: How to Navigate with Search Parameters
---

This guide covers updating and managing search parameters during navigation using TanStack Router's Link components and programmatic navigation methods.

**Prerequisites:** [Set Up Basic Search Parameters](./setup-basic-search-params.md) - Foundation concepts for reading and validating search params.

## Quick Start

Configure navigation that updates search parameters while preserving existing state:

```tsx
import { Link, useNavigate } from "@tanstack/react-router";

// Link with search parameter updates
<Link to="/search" search={(prev) => ({ ...prev, query: "new search" })}>
  Search for "new search"
</Link>;

// Programmatic navigation
const navigate = useNavigate();
navigate({
  to: "/search",
  search: (prev) => ({ ...prev, page: 1 }),
});
```

## Navigation Methods

### Using Link Components

#### Basic Search Parameter Updates

Replace all search parameters:

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/router";

function SearchForm() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Replace all search params */}
      <Link to="/products" search={{ category: "electronics", page: 1 }}>
        Electronics
      </Link>

      {/* Navigate to same route with new search */}
      <Link search={{ sort: "price-asc" }}>Sort by Price</Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Functional Search Parameter Updates

Merge with existing search parameters:

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function Pagination() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Preserve existing search, update page */}
      <Link search={(prev) => ({ ...prev, page: (prev.page || 1) + 1 })}>Next Page</Link>

      {/* Toggle filter while keeping other params */}
      <Link
        search={(prev) => ({
          ...prev,
          inStock: !prev.inStock,
        })}
      >
        Toggle In Stock
      </Link>

      {/* Remove a search parameter */}
      <Link
        search={(prev) => {
          const { category, ...rest } = prev;
          return rest;
        }}
      >
        Clear Category Filter
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Preserving All Search Parameters

Use `search={true}` to keep all current search parameters when navigating:

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function Navigation() {
  return (
    <nav>
      {/* Keep all search params when changing routes */}
      <Link to="/products" search={true}>
        View Products (Keep Filters)
      </Link>

      {/* Equivalent functional approach */}
      <Link to="/products" search={(prev) => prev}>
        View Products (Functional)
      </Link>
    </nav>
  );
}
```

#### Navigation with Route Changes

Navigate to different routes with search parameters:

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function Navigation() {
  return (
    <nav>
      {/* Navigate to different route with search */}
      <Link to="/search" search={{ query: "laptops", category: "electronics" }}>
        Search Laptops
      </Link>

      {/* Inherit current search params to new route */}
      <Link
        to="/products"
        search={true} // Shorthand to carry over all search params
      >
        View Products
      </Link>

      {/* Transform search params for new route */}
      <Link
        to="/advanced-search"
        search={(prev) => ({
          q: prev.query, // Rename parameter
          filters: {
            category: prev.category,
            inStock: prev.inStock,
          },
        })}
      >
        Advanced Search
      </Link>
    </nav>
  );
}
```

### Programmatic Navigation

#### Using useNavigate Hook

Navigate programmatically with search parameter updates:

```tsx
import { useNavigate } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function SearchControls() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleSortChange = (sortBy: string) => {
    navigate({
      search: (prev) => ({ ...prev, sort: sortBy, page: 1 }),
    });
  };

  const handleClearFilters = () => {
    navigate({
      search: (prev) => {
        const { category, minPrice, maxPrice, ...rest } = prev;
        return rest;
      },
    });
  };

  const handleSearch = (query: string) => {
    navigate({
      to: "/search",
      search: { query, page: 1 },
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <select onChange={(e) => handleSortChange(e.target.value)}>
        <option value="relevance">Sort by Relevance</option>
        <option value="price-asc">Price: Low to High</option>
        <option value="price-desc">Price: High to Low</option>
      </select>

      <button onClick={handleClearFilters}>Clear Filters</button>

      <button onClick={() => handleSearch("latest products")}>Search Latest</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Navigation with Router Instance

Use the router directly only in non-React contexts where `useNavigate` or `Link` aren't available:

```tsx
import { router } from "./router"; // Your router instance

// ✅ Appropriate use case: Utility function outside React components
export function navigateFromUtility(searchParams: Record<string, any>) {
  router.navigate({
    search: (prev) => ({ ...prev, ...searchParams }),
  });
}

// ✅ Appropriate use case: Event handlers in non-React code
class ApiService {
  onAuthError() {
    // Navigate to login when auth fails
    router.navigate({
      to: "/login",
      search: { redirect: window.location.pathname },
    });
  }
}

// ✅ Appropriate use case: Global error handler
window.addEventListener("unhandledrejection", (event) => {
  if (event.reason.status === 401) {
    router.navigate({
      to: "/login",
      search: { error: "session-expired" },
    });
  }
});
```

**⚠️ In React components, prefer `useNavigate` instead:**

```tsx
// ❌ Avoid in React components
function Component() {
  const router = useRouter();

  const handleClick = () => {
    router.navigate({ search: { filter: "active" } });
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Filter</button>;
}

// ✅ Use useNavigate in React components
function Component() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleClick = () => {
    navigate({ search: { filter: "active" } });
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Filter</button>;
}
```

## Advanced Navigation Patterns

### Conditional Navigation

Navigate automatically when certain conditions are met:

```tsx
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useNavigate, useSearch } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function ConditionalNavigation() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const search = useSearch({ from: "/products" });

  // Auto-reset page when search query changes
  useEffect(() => {
    if (search.query && search.page > 1) {
      navigate({
        search: (prev) => ({ ...prev, page: 1 }),
      });
    }
  }, [search.query, search.page, navigate]);

  return <div>Page resets automatically when search changes</div>;
}
```

## Common Patterns

## Common Problems

### Search Parameters Not Updating

**Problem:** Link navigation doesn't update search parameters.

```tsx
// ❌ Wrong - no search prop
<Link to="/products">Electronics</Link>

// ✅ Correct - with search parameters
<Link to="/products" search={{ category: 'electronics' }}>
  Electronics
</Link>
```

### Losing Existing Search Parameters

**Problem:** New navigation replaces all search parameters instead of updating specific ones.

```tsx
// ❌ Wrong - replaces all search params
<Link search={{ page: 2 }}>Next Page</Link>

// ✅ Correct - preserves existing search params
<Link search={(prev) => ({ ...prev, page: 2 })}>
  Next Page
</Link>
```

## Common Next Steps

After mastering navigation with search parameters, you might want to:

- [Validate Search Parameters with Schemas](./validate-search-params.md) - Add robust validation with Zod, Valibot, or ArkType
- [Work with Arrays, Objects, and Dates](./arrays-objects-dates-search-params.md) - Handle arrays, objects, dates, and nested data structures

title: How to Set Up Authentication Providers
---

This guide covers integrating popular authentication services (Auth0, Clerk, Supabase) with TanStack Router.

## Quick Start

Choose an authentication provider, install their SDK, wrap your router with their context, and adapt their auth state to work with TanStack Router's context system.

---

## Auth0 Integration

### 1. Install Auth0

```bash
npm install @auth0/auth0-react
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```env
VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain.auth0.com
VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your_auth0_client_id
```

### 3. Create Auth0 Wrapper

Create `src/auth/auth0.tsx`:

```tsx
import { Auth0Provider, useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-react";
import { createContext, useContext } from "react";

interface Auth0ContextType {
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  user: any;
  login: () => void;
  logout: () => void;
  isLoading: boolean;
}

const Auth0Context = createContext<Auth0ContextType | undefined>(undefined);

export function Auth0Wrapper({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <Auth0Provider
      domain={import.meta.env.VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN}
      clientId={import.meta.env.VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID}
      authorizationParams={{
        redirect_uri: window.location.origin,
      }}
    >
      <Auth0ContextProvider>{children}</Auth0ContextProvider>
    </Auth0Provider>
  );
}

function Auth0ContextProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const { isAuthenticated, user, loginWithRedirect, logout, isLoading } = useAuth0();

  const contextValue = {
    isAuthenticated,
    user,
    login: loginWithRedirect,
    logout: () => logout({ logoutParams: { returnTo: window.location.origin } }),
    isLoading,
  };

  return <Auth0Context.Provider value={contextValue}>{children}</Auth0Context.Provider>;
}

export function useAuth0Context() {
  const context = useContext(Auth0Context);
  if (context === undefined) {
    throw new Error("useAuth0Context must be used within Auth0Wrapper");
  }
  return context;
}
```

### 4. Update App Configuration

Update `src/App.tsx`:

```tsx
import { RouterProvider } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { Auth0Wrapper, useAuth0Context } from "./auth/auth0";
import { router } from "./router";

function InnerApp() {
  const auth = useAuth0Context();

  if (auth.isLoading) {
    return (
      <div className="flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center">Loading...</div>
    );
  }

  return <RouterProvider router={router} context={{ auth }} />;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Auth0Wrapper>
      <InnerApp />
    </Auth0Wrapper>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### 5. Create Protected Routes

Create `src/routes/_authenticated.tsx`:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute, redirect, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/_authenticated")({
  beforeLoad: ({ context, location }) => {
    if (!context.auth.isAuthenticated) {
      // Auth0 handles login redirects, so just trigger login
      context.auth.login();
      return;
    }
  },
  component: () => <Outlet />,
});
```

## Clerk Integration

### 1. Install Clerk

```bash
npm install @clerk/clerk-react
```

```env
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_clerk_key
```

### 3. Create Clerk Wrapper

Create `src/auth/clerk.tsx`:

```tsx
import { ClerkProvider, useUser, useAuth } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

export function ClerkWrapper({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider publishableKey={import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}>
      {children}
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}

export function useClerkAuth() {
  const { isSignedIn, isLoaded } = useAuth();
  const { user } = useUser();

  return {
    isAuthenticated: isSignedIn,
    user: user
      ? {
          id: user.id,
          username: user.username || user.primaryEmailAddress?.emailAddress || "",
          email: user.primaryEmailAddress?.emailAddress || "",
        }
      : null,
    isLoading: !isLoaded,
    login: () => {
      // Clerk handles login through components
      window.location.href = "/sign-in";
    },
    logout: () => {
      // Clerk handles logout through components
      window.location.href = "/sign-out";
    },
  };
}
```

### 4. Create Clerk Auth Routes

Create `src/routes/sign-in.tsx`:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { SignIn } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/sign-in")({
  component: () => (
    <div className="flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center">
      <SignIn redirectUrl="/dashboard" signUpUrl="/sign-up" />
    </div>
  ),
});
```

Create `src/routes/sign-up.tsx`:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { SignUp } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/sign-up")({
  component: () => (
    <div className="flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center">

  const auth = useClerkAuth();

  if (auth.isLoading) {
    return (
      <div className="flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center">Loading...</div>
    );
  }

  return <RouterProvider router={router} context={{ auth }} />;
}

function App() {

import { createFileRoute, redirect, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/_authenticated")({
  beforeLoad: ({ context, location }) => {
    if (!context.auth.isAuthenticated) {
      throw redirect({
        to: "/sign-in",
        search: {
          redirect: location.href,
        },
      });
    }
  },
  component: () => <Outlet />,
});
```

---

## Supabase Integration

### 1. Install Supabase

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 3. Create Supabase Client

Create `src/auth/supabase.tsx`:

```tsx
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";
import { createContext, useContext, useEffect, useState } from "react";

const supabase = createClient(
  import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL,
  import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,
);

interface SupabaseAuthState {
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  user: any;
  login: (email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => Promise<void>;
  isLoading: boolean;
}

const SupabaseAuthContext = createContext<SupabaseAuthState | undefined>(undefined);

export function SupabaseAuthProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(false);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Get initial session
    supabase.auth.getSession().then(({ data: { session } }) => {
      setUser(session?.user ?? null);
      setIsAuthenticated(!!session?.user);
      setIsLoading(false);
    });

    // Listen for auth changes
    const {
      data: { subscription },
    } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((_event, session) => {
      setUser(session?.user ?? null);
      setIsAuthenticated(!!session?.user);
      setIsLoading(false);
    });

    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
  }, []);

  const login = async (email: string, password: string) => {
    const { error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
      email,
      password,
    });
    if (error) throw error;
  };

  const logout = async () => {
    const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut();
    if (error) throw error;
  };

  return (
    <SupabaseAuthContext.Provider
      value={{
        isAuthenticated,

  );
}

export function useSupabaseAuth() {
  const context = useContext(SupabaseAuthContext);
  if (context === undefined) {
    throw new Error("useSupabaseAuth must be used within SupabaseAuthProvider");
  }
  return context;
}
```

### 4. Create Login Component

Create `src/routes/login.tsx`:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute, redirect } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { useState } from "react";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/login")({
  validateSearch: (search) => ({
    redirect: (search.redirect as string) || "/dashboard",
  }),
  beforeLoad: ({ context, search }) => {
    if (context.auth.isAuthenticated) {
      throw redirect({ to: search.redirect });
    }
  },
  component: LoginComponent,
});

function LoginComponent() {
  const { auth } = Route.useRouteContext();
  const { redirect } = Route.useSearch();
  const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
  const [password, setPassword] = useState("");
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState("");

  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setIsLoading(true);
    setError("");

    try {
      await auth.login(email, password);
      // Supabase auth will automatically update context
      window.location.href = redirect;
    } catch (err: any) {
      setError(err.message || "Login failed");
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center">
      <form
        onSubmit={handleSubmit}
        className="w-full max-w-md space-y-4 rounded-lg border p-6"
      >
        <h1 className="text-center text-2xl font-bold">Sign In</h1>

        {error && (
          <div className="rounded border border-red-400 bg-red-100 px-4 py-3 text-red-700">
            {error}
          </div>
        )}

        <div>
          <label htmlFor="email" className="mb-1 block text-sm font-medium">
            Email
          </label>
          <input
            id="email"
            type="email"
            value={email}
            onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
            className="w-full rounded-md border border-gray-300 px-3 py-2 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:outline-none"
            required
          />
        </div>

        <div>
          <label htmlFor="password" className="mb-1 block text-sm font-medium">
            Password
          </label>
          <input
            id="password"
            type="password"
            value={password}
            onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
            className="w-full rounded-md border border-gray-300 px-3 py-2 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:outline-none"
            required
          />
        </div>

        <button
          type="submit"
          disabled={isLoading}
          className="w-full rounded-md bg-blue-600 px-4 py-2 text-white hover:bg-blue-700 disabled:opacity-50"
        >
          {isLoading ? "Signing in..." : "Sign In"}
        </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 5. Update App Configuration

Update `src/App.tsx`:

```tsx

import { SupabaseAuthProvider, useSupabaseAuth } from "./auth/supabase";
import { router } from "./router";

function InnerApp() {
  const auth = useSupabaseAuth();

  if (auth.isLoading) {
    return (
      <div className="flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center">Loading...</div>
    );
  }

  return <RouterProvider router={router} context={{ auth }} />;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <SupabaseAuthProvider>
      <InnerApp />
    </SupabaseAuthProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Provider Comparison

| Feature                 | Auth0    | Clerk     | Supabase |
| ----------------------- | -------- | --------- | -------- |
| **Setup Complexity**    | Medium   | Low       | Medium   |
| **UI Components**       | Basic    | Excellent | None     |
| **Customization**       | High     | Medium    | High     |
| **Pricing**             | Freemium | Freemium  | Freemium |
| **Social Login**        | ✅       | ✅        | ✅       |
| **Enterprise Features** | ✅       | ✅        | ✅       |
| **Database Included**   | ❌       | ❌        | ✅       |

### When to Choose Each:

- **Auth0**: Complex enterprise requirements, extensive customization
- **Clerk**: Quick setup with beautiful UI components
- **Supabase**: Full-stack solution with database and real-time features

---

## Common Problems

### Provider Context Not Available

**Problem:** Auth context is undefined in components.

**Solution:** Ensure the provider wrapper is above `RouterProvider`:

```tsx
// ✅ Correct order
<AuthProvider>
  <InnerApp>
    <RouterProvider />
  </InnerApp>
</AuthProvider>

// ❌ Wrong order
<RouterProvider>
  <AuthProvider />
</RouterProvider>
```

### Infinite Loading States

**Problem:** App stuck on loading screen.

**Solution:** Check if auth provider properly sets `isLoading` to `false`:

```tsx
// Add timeout fallback
useEffect(() => {
  const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
    if (isLoading) {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  }, 5000);
  return () => clearTimeout(timeout);
}, [isLoading]);
```

### Redirect Loops with Auth0

**Problem:** Continuous redirects between login and protected routes.

**Solution:** Handle Auth0's automatic redirects properly:

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/_authenticated")({
  beforeLoad: ({ context }) => {
    if (!context.auth.isAuthenticated && !context.auth.isLoading) {
      context.auth.login();
      // Don't throw redirect, let Auth0 handle it
      return;
    }
  },
  component: () => <Outlet />,
});
```

title: How to Set Up Basic Authentication and Protected Routes
---

This guide covers implementing basic authentication patterns and protecting routes in TanStack Router applications.

## Quick Start

Set up authentication by creating a context-aware router, implementing auth state management, and using `beforeLoad` for route protection. This guide focuses on the core authentication setup using React Context.

---

## Create Authentication Context

Create `src/auth.tsx`:

```tsx
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect } from "react";

interface User {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  email: string;
}

interface AuthState {
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  user: User | null;
  login: (username: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => void;
}

const AuthContext = createContext<AuthState | undefined>(undefined);

export function AuthProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
  const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(false);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  // Restore auth state on app load
  useEffect(() => {
    const token = localStorage.getItem("auth-token");
    if (token) {
      // Validate token with your API
      fetch("/api/validate-token", {
        headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
      })
        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then((userData) => {
          if (userData.valid) {
            setUser(userData.user);
            setIsAuthenticated(true);
          } else {
            localStorage.removeItem("auth-token");
          }
        })
        .catch(() => {
          localStorage.removeItem("auth-token");
        })
        .finally(() => {
          setIsLoading(false);
        });
    } else {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  }, []);

  // Show loading state while checking auth
  if (isLoading) {
    return (
      <div className="flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center">Loading...</div>
    );
  }

  const login = async (username: string, password: string) => {
    // Replace with your authentication logic
    const response = await fetch("/api/login", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ username, password }),
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      const userData = await response.json();
      setUser(userData);
      setIsAuthenticated(true);
      // Store token for persistence
      localStorage.setItem("auth-token", userData.token);
    } else {
      throw new Error("Authentication failed");
    }
  };

  const logout = () => {
    setUser(null);
    setIsAuthenticated(false);
    localStorage.removeItem("auth-token");
  };

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ isAuthenticated, user, login, logout }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
}

export function useAuth() {
  const context = useContext(AuthContext);
  if (context === undefined) {
    throw new Error("useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider");
  }
  return context;
}
```

---

## Configure Router Context

### 1. Set Up Router Context

Update `src/routes/__root.tsx`:

```tsx
import { createRootRouteWithContext, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from "@tanstack/react-router-devtools";

interface AuthState {
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  user: { id: string; username: string; email: string } | null;
  login: (username: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => void;
}

interface MyRouterContext {
  auth: AuthState;
}

export const Route = createRootRouteWithContext<MyRouterContext>()({
  component: () => (
    <div>
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </div>
  ),
});
```

### 2. Configure Router

Update `src/router.tsx`:

```tsx
import { createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

export const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
  context: {
    // auth will be passed down from App component
    auth: undefined!,
  },
});

declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
  interface Register {
    router: typeof router;
  }
}
```

### 3. Connect App with Authentication

Update `src/App.tsx`:

```tsx
import { RouterProvider } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { AuthProvider, useAuth } from "./auth";
import { router } from "./router";

function InnerApp() {
  const auth = useAuth();
  return <RouterProvider router={router} context={{ auth }} />;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <AuthProvider>
      <InnerApp />
    </AuthProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

## Create Protected Routes

### 1. Create Authentication Layout Route

Create `src/routes/_authenticated.tsx`:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute, redirect, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/_authenticated")({
  beforeLoad: ({ context, location }) => {
    if (!context.auth.isAuthenticated) {
      throw redirect({
        to: "/login",
        search: {
          // Save current location for redirect after login
          redirect: location.href,
        },
      });
    }
  },
  component: () => <Outlet />,
});
```

### 2. Create Login Route

Create `src/routes/login.tsx`:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute, redirect } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { useState } from "react";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/login")({
  validateSearch: (search) => ({
    redirect: (search.redirect as string) || "/",
  }),
  beforeLoad: ({ context, search }) => {
    // Redirect if already authenticated
    if (context.auth.isAuthenticated) {
      throw redirect({ to: search.redirect });
    }
  },
  component: LoginComponent,
});

function LoginComponent() {
  const { auth } = Route.useRouteContext();
  const { redirect } = Route.useSearch();
  const navigate = Route.useNavigate();
  const [username, setUsername] = useState("");
  const [password, setPassword] = useState("");
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState("");

  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    setIsLoading(true);
    setError("");

    try {
      await auth.login(username, password);
      // Navigate to the redirect URL using router navigation
      navigate({ to: redirect });
    } catch (err) {
      setError("Invalid username or password");
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center">
      <form
        onSubmit={handleSubmit}
        className="w-full max-w-md space-y-4 rounded-lg border p-6"
      >
        <h1 className="text-center text-2xl font-bold">Sign In</h1>

        {error && (
          <div className="rounded border border-red-400 bg-red-100 px-4 py-3 text-red-700">
            {error}
          </div>
        )}

        <div>
          <label htmlFor="username" className="mb-1 block text-sm font-medium">
            Username
          </label>
          <input
            id="username"
            type="text"
            value={username}
            onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)}
            className="w-full rounded-md border border-gray-300 px-3 py-2 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:outline-none"
            required
          />
        </div>

        <div>
          <label htmlFor="password" className="mb-1 block text-sm font-medium">
            Password
          </label>
          <input
            id="password"
            type="password"
            value={password}
            onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
            className="w-full rounded-md border border-gray-300 px-3 py-2 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:outline-none"
            required
          />
        </div>

        <button
          type="submit"
          disabled={isLoading}
          className="w-full rounded-md bg-blue-600 px-4 py-2 text-white hover:bg-blue-700 disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-50"
        >
          {isLoading ? "Signing in..." : "Sign In"}
        </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 3. Create Protected Dashboard

Create `src/routes/_authenticated/dashboard.tsx`:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/_authenticated/dashboard")({
  component: DashboardComponent,
});

function DashboardComponent() {
  const { auth } = Route.useRouteContext();

  return (
    <div className="p-6">
      <div className="mb-6 flex items-center justify-between">
        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Dashboard</h1>
        <button
          onClick={auth.logout}
          className="rounded bg-red-600 px-4 py-2 text-white hover:bg-red-700"
        >
          Sign Out
        </button>
      </div>

      <div className="rounded-lg bg-white p-6 shadow">
        <h2 className="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">Welcome back!</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          Hello, <strong>{auth.user?.username}</strong>! You are successfully
          authenticated.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-500">Email: {auth.user?.email}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

## Add Authentication Persistence

Update your `AuthProvider` to restore authentication state on page refresh:

```tsx
export function AuthProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
  const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(false);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  // Restore auth state on app load
  useEffect(() => {
    const token = localStorage.getItem("auth-token");
    if (token) {
      // Validate token with your API
      fetch("/api/validate-token", {
        headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
      })
        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then((userData) => {
          if (userData.valid) {
            setUser(userData.user);
            setIsAuthenticated(true);
          } else {
            localStorage.removeItem("auth-token");
          }
        })
        .catch(() => {
          localStorage.removeItem("auth-token");
        })
        .finally(() => {
          setIsLoading(false);
        });
    } else {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  }, []);

  // Show loading state while checking auth
  if (isLoading) {
    return (
      <div className="flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center">Loading...</div>
    );
  }

  // ... rest of the provider logic
}
```

---

## Production Checklist

Before deploying authentication, ensure you have:

- [ ] Secured API endpoints with proper authentication middleware
- [ ] Set up HTTPS in production (required for secure cookies)
- [ ] Configured environment variables for API endpoints
- [ ] Implemented proper token validation and refresh
- [ ] Added CSRF protection for form-based authentication
- [ ] Tested authentication flows (login, logout, persistence)
- [ ] Added proper error handling for network failures
- [ ] Implemented loading states for auth operations

---

## Common Problems

### Authentication Context Not Available

**Problem:** `useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider` error.

**Solution:** Ensure `AuthProvider` wraps your entire app and `RouterProvider` is inside it.

### User Logged Out on Page Refresh

**Problem:** Authentication state resets when page refreshes.

**Solution:** Add token persistence as shown in the persistence section above.

### Protected Route Flashing Before Redirect

**Problem:** Protected content briefly shows before redirecting to login.

**Solution:** Use `beforeLoad` instead of component-level auth checks:

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/_authenticated/dashboard")({
  beforeLoad: ({ context }) => {
    if (!context.auth.isAuthenticated) {
      throw redirect({ to: "/login" });
    }
  },
  component: DashboardComponent,
});
```

title: How to Set Up Basic Search Parameters
---

Learn how to add type-safe, production-ready search parameters to your TanStack Router routes using schema validation. This guide covers the fundamentals of search parameter validation, reading values, and handling different data types with any standard schema-compliant validation library.

## Quick Start

Set up search parameters with schema validation (recommended for production):

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { zodValidator, fallback } from "@tanstack/zod-adapter";
import { z } from "zod";

const productSearchSchema = z.object({
  page: fallback(z.number(), 1).default(1),
  category: fallback(z.string(), "all").default("all"),
  showSale: fallback(z.boolean(), false).default(false),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/products")({
  validateSearch: zodValidator(productSearchSchema),
  component: ProductsPage,
});

function ProductsPage() {
  const { page, category, showSale } = Route.useSearch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Products</h1>
      <p>Page: {page}</p>
      <p>Category: {category}</p>
      <p>Show Sale Items: {showSale ? "Yes" : "No"}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Why Use Schema Validation for Search Parameters?

**Production Benefits:**

- **Type Safety**: Automatic TypeScript inference
- **Runtime Validation**: Catches invalid URL parameters gracefully
- **Default Values**: Fallback handling for missing parameters
- **Error Handling**: Built-in validation error management
- **Maintainability**: Clear, declarative schema definitions

## Validation Library Setup

TanStack Router supports any standard schema-compliant validation library. This guide focuses on Zod for examples, but you can use any validation library:

```bash
npm install zod @tanstack/zod-adapter
```

```tsx
import { zodValidator, fallback } from "@tanstack/zod-adapter";
import { z } from "zod";

const searchSchema = z.object({
  page: fallback(z.number(), 1).default(1),
  category: fallback(z.string(), "all").default("all"),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/products")({
  validateSearch: zodValidator(searchSchema),
  component: ProductsPage,
});
```

**For detailed validation library comparisons and advanced validation patterns, see:** [Validate Search Parameters with Schemas](./validate-search-params.md)

## Step-by-Step Setup with Zod

The rest of this guide uses Zod for examples, but the patterns apply to any validation library.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install zod @tanstack/zod-adapter
```

### Step 2: Define Your Search Schema

Start by identifying what search parameters your route needs:

```tsx
import { z } from "zod";
import { fallback } from "@tanstack/zod-adapter";

const shopSearchSchema = z.object({
  // Pagination
  page: fallback(z.number(), 1).default(1),
  limit: fallback(z.number(), 20).default(20),

  // Filtering
  category: fallback(z.string(), "all").default("all"),
  minPrice: fallback(z.number(), 0).default(0),
  maxPrice: fallback(z.number(), 1000).default(1000),

  // Settings
  sort: fallback(z.enum(["name", "price", "date"]), "name").default("name"),
  ascending: fallback(z.boolean(), true).default(true),

  // Optional parameters
  searchTerm: z.string().optional(),
  showOnlyInStock: fallback(z.boolean(), false).default(false),
});

type ShopSearch = z.infer<typeof shopSearchSchema>;
```

### Step 3: Add Schema Validation to Route

Use the validation adapter to connect your schema to the route:

```tsx
import { zodValidator } from "@tanstack/zod-adapter";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/shop")({
  validateSearch: zodValidator(shopSearchSchema),
  component: ShopPage,
});
```

### Step 4: Read Search Parameters in Components

Use the route's `useSearch()` hook to access validated and typed search parameters:

```tsx
function ShopPage() {
  const searchParams = Route.useSearch();

  // All properties are fully type-safe and validated
  const { page, limit, category, sort, ascending, searchTerm, showOnlyInStock } =
    searchParams;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Shop - Page {page}</h1>
      <div>Category: {category}</div>
      <div>
        Sort: {sort} ({ascending ? "ascending" : "descending"})
      </div>
      <div>Items per page: {limit}</div>
      <div>In stock only: {showOnlyInStock ? "Yes" : "No"}</div>
      {searchTerm && <div>Search: "{searchTerm}"</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Common Search Parameter Patterns

### Pagination with Constraints

```tsx
const paginationSchema = z.object({
  page: fallback(z.number().min(1), 1).default(1),
  limit: fallback(z.number().min(10).max(100), 20).default(20),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  validateSearch: zodValidator(paginationSchema),
  component: PostsPage,
});

function PostsPage() {
  const { page, limit } = Route.useSearch();

  // Calculate offset for API calls
  const offset = (page - 1) * limit;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Posts (Page {page})</h1>
      <p>Showing {limit} posts per page</p>
      <p>Offset: {offset}</p>
      {/* Render posts... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Enum Validation with Defaults

```tsx
const catalogSchema = z.object({
  sort: fallback(z.enum(["name", "date", "price"]), "name").default("name"),
  category: fallback(z.enum(["electronics", "clothing", "books", "all"]), "all").default(
    "all",
  ),
  ascending: fallback(z.boolean(), true).default(true),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/catalog")({
  validateSearch: zodValidator(catalogSchema),
  component: CatalogPage,
});
```

### Complex Data Types

```tsx
const dashboardSchema = z.object({
  // Numbers with validation
  userId: fallback(z.number().positive(), 1).default(1),
  refreshInterval: fallback(z.number().min(1000).max(60000), 5000).default(5000),

  // Strings with validation
  theme: fallback(z.enum(["light", "dark"]), "light").default("light"),
  timezone: z.string().optional(),

  // Arrays with validation
  selectedIds: fallback(z.number().array(), []).default([]),
  tags: fallback(z.string().array(), []).default([]),

  // Objects with validation
  filters: fallback(
    z.object({
      status: z.enum(["active", "inactive"]).optional(),
      type: z.string().optional(),
    }),
    {},
  ).default({}),
});
```

### Date and Advanced Types

```tsx
const reportSchema = z.object({
  startDate: z.string().pipe(z.coerce.date()).optional(),
  endDate: z.string().pipe(z.coerce.date()).optional(),
  format: fallback(z.enum(["pdf", "csv", "excel"]), "pdf").default("pdf"),
  includeCharts: fallback(z.boolean(), true).default(true),
});
```

## Reading Search Parameters Outside Components

### Using getRouteApi

For code-split components or separate files:

```tsx
// components/ProductFilters.tsx
import { getRouteApi } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const routeApi = getRouteApi("/products");

export function ProductFilters() {
  const { category, sort, showSale } = routeApi.useSearch();

  return (
    <div>
      <select value={category}>
        <option value="all">All Categories</option>
        <option value="electronics">Electronics</option>
        <option value="clothing">Clothing</option>
      </select>
      {/* More filters... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Using useSearch with from

```tsx
import { useSearch } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function GenericSearchDisplay() {
  const search = useSearch({ from: "/products" });

  return <div>Current filters: {JSON.stringify(search, null, 2)}</div>;
}
```

## Manual Validation (Understanding the Primitives)

While schema validation is recommended for production, understanding manual validation helps you understand how search parameters work under the hood:

```tsx
// Educational example - use schema validation for production
export const Route = createFileRoute("/example")({
  validateSearch: (search: Record<string, unknown>) => ({
    // Numbers need coercion from URL strings
    page: Number(search.page) || 1,

    // Strings can be cast with defaults
    category: (search.category as string) || "all",

    // Booleans: TanStack Router auto-converts "true"/"false" to booleans
    showSale: Boolean(search.showSale),

    // Arrays need JSON parsing validation
    selectedIds: Array.isArray(search.selectedIds)
      ? search.selectedIds.map(Number).filter(Boolean)
      : [],
  }),
  component: ExamplePage,
});
```

## Production Checklist

- [x] **Use schema validation** with a validation library for type safety and runtime validation
- [x] **Add fallback values** for graceful error handling
- [x] **Set default values** for optional parameters
- [x] **Validate constraints** using your validation library's built-in validators
- [x] **Handle optional parameters** appropriately
- [x] **Type inference** works automatically with proper schema setup
- [x] **Error boundaries** are configured to handle validation failures

## Common Problems

### Problem: Search Parameters Cause TypeScript Errors

**Cause:** Missing or incorrect schema definition.

**Solution:** Ensure your schema covers all search parameters and use proper types:

```tsx
// ❌ Missing schema or incorrect types
export const Route = createFileRoute("/page")({
  component: MyPage,
});

// ✅ Complete schema with proper validation
const searchSchema = z.object({
  page: fallback(z.number(), 1).default(1),
  category: fallback(z.string(), "all").default("all"),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/page")({
  validateSearch: zodValidator(searchSchema),
  component: MyPage,
});
```

### Problem: Invalid URL Parameters Break the App

**Cause:** Not using fallback handling for error cases.

**Solution:** Use fallback values to provide safe defaults:

```tsx
// ❌ No fallback handling
const schema = z.object({
  page: z.number().default(1), // Will throw on invalid input
});

// ✅ Graceful fallback handling
const schema = z.object({
  page: fallback(z.number(), 1).default(1), // Safe fallback to 1
});
```

### Problem: Optional Parameters Are Required by TypeScript

**Cause:** Using `.default()` makes parameters required in navigation.

**Solution:** Use `.optional()` for truly optional parameters:

```tsx
const schema = z.object({
  // Required with default (navigation can omit, but always present in component)
  page: fallback(z.number(), 1).default(1),

  // Truly optional (can be undefined in component)
  searchTerm: z.string().optional(),
});
```

### Problem: Complex Objects Not Validating

**Cause:** Nested objects need explicit schema definition.

**Solution:** Define complete nested schemas:

```tsx
const schema = z.object({
  filters: fallback(
    z.object({
      status: z.enum(["active", "inactive"]).optional(),
      tags: z.string().array().optional(),
      dateRange: z
        .object({
          start: z.string().pipe(z.coerce.date()),
          end: z.string().pipe(z.coerce.date()),
        })
        .optional(),
    }),
    {},
  ).default({}),
});
```

title: How to Set Up Role-Based Access Control
---

This guide covers implementing role-based access control (RBAC) and permission-based routing in TanStack Router applications.

## Quick Start

Extend your authentication context to include roles and permissions, create role-protected layout routes, and use `beforeLoad` to check user permissions before rendering routes.

---

## Extend Authentication Context

### 1. Add Roles to User Type

Update your authentication context to include roles:

```tsx
// src/auth.tsx
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from "react";

interface User {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  email: string;
  roles: string[];
  permissions: string[];
}

interface AuthState {
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  user: User | null;
  hasRole: (role: string) => boolean;
  hasAnyRole: (roles: string[]) => boolean;
  hasPermission: (permission: string) => boolean;
  hasAnyPermission: (permissions: string[]) => boolean;
  login: (username: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => void;
}

const AuthContext = createContext<AuthState | undefined>(undefined);

export function AuthProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
  const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(false);

  const hasRole = (role: string) => {
    return user?.roles.includes(role) ?? false;
  };

  const hasAnyRole = (roles: string[]) => {
    return roles.some((role) => user?.roles.includes(role)) ?? false;
  };

  const hasPermission = (permission: string) => {
    return user?.permissions.includes(permission) ?? false;
  };

  const hasAnyPermission = (permissions: string[]) => {
    return (
      permissions.some((permission) => user?.permissions.includes(permission)) ?? false
    );
  };

  const login = async (username: string, password: string) => {
    const response = await fetch("/api/login", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ username, password }),
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      const userData = await response.json();
      setUser(userData);
      setIsAuthenticated(true);
    } else {
      throw new Error("Authentication failed");
    }
  };

  const logout = () => {
    setUser(null);
    setIsAuthenticated(false);
  };

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider
      value={{
        isAuthenticated,
        user,
        hasRole,
        hasAnyRole,
        hasPermission,
        hasAnyPermission,
        login,
        logout,
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
}

export function useAuth() {
  const context = useContext(AuthContext);
  if (context === undefined) {
    throw new Error("useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider");
  }
  return context;
}
```

### 2. Update Router Context Types

Update `src/routes/__root.tsx`:

```tsx
import { createRootRouteWithContext, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";

interface AuthState {
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  user: {
    id: string;
    username: string;
    email: string;
    roles: string[];
    permissions: string[];
  } | null;
  hasRole: (role: string) => boolean;
  hasAnyRole: (roles: string[]) => boolean;
  hasPermission: (permission: string) => boolean;
  hasAnyPermission: (permissions: string[]) => boolean;
  login: (username: string, password: string) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => void;
}

interface MyRouterContext {
  auth: AuthState;
}

export const Route = createRootRouteWithContext<MyRouterContext>()({
  component: () => (
    <div>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  ),
});
```

---

## Create Role-Protected Routes

### 1. Admin-Only Routes

Create `src/routes/_authenticated/_admin.tsx`:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute, redirect, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/_authenticated/_admin")({
  beforeLoad: ({ context, location }) => {
    if (!context.auth.hasRole("admin")) {
      throw redirect({
        to: "/unauthorized",
        search: {
          redirect: location.href,
        },
      });
    }
  },
  component: AdminLayout,
});

function AdminLayout() {
  return (
    <div>
      <div className="mb-4 rounded border border-red-400 bg-red-100 px-4 py-3 text-red-700">
        <strong>Admin Area:</strong> You have administrative privileges.
      </div>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. Multiple Role Access

Create `src/routes/_authenticated/_moderator.tsx`:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute, redirect, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/_authenticated/_moderator")({
  beforeLoad: ({ context, location }) => {
    const allowedRoles = ["admin", "moderator"];
    if (!context.auth.hasAnyRole(allowedRoles)) {
      throw redirect({
        to: "/unauthorized",
        search: {
          redirect: location.href,
          reason: "insufficient_role",
        },
      });
    }
  },
  component: ModeratorLayout,
});

function ModeratorLayout() {
  const { auth } = Route.useRouteContext();

  return (
    <div>
      <div className="mb-4 rounded border border-blue-400 bg-blue-100 px-4 py-3 text-blue-700">
        <strong>Moderator Area:</strong> Role: {auth.user?.roles.join(", ")}
      </div>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 3. Permission-Based Routes

Create `src/routes/_authenticated/_users.tsx`:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute, redirect, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/_authenticated/_users")({
  beforeLoad: ({ context, location }) => {
    const requiredPermissions = ["users:read", "users:write"];
    if (!context.auth.hasAnyPermission(requiredPermissions)) {
      throw redirect({
        to: "/unauthorized",
        search: {
          redirect: location.href,
          reason: "insufficient_permissions",
        },
      });
    }
  },
  component: () => <Outlet />,
});
```

## Create Specific Protected Pages

### 1. Admin Dashboard

Create `src/routes/_authenticated/_admin/dashboard.tsx`:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/_authenticated/_admin/dashboard")({

## Create Unauthorized Page

Create `src/routes/unauthorized.tsx`:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute, Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/unauthorized")({
  validateSearch: (search) => ({
    redirect: (search.redirect as string) || "/dashboard",
    reason: (search.reason as string) || "insufficient_permissions",
  }),
  component: UnauthorizedPage,
});

function UnauthorizedPage() {
  const { redirect, reason } = Route.useSearch();
  const { auth } = Route.useRouteContext();

  const reasonMessages = {
    insufficient_role: "You do not have the required role to access this page.",
    insufficient_permissions:
      "You do not have the required permissions to access this page.",
    default: "You are not authorized to access this page.",
  };

  const message =
    reasonMessages[reason as keyof typeof reasonMessages] || reasonMessages.default;

  return (

            Try Again
          </Link>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Component-Level Permission Checks

### 1. Conditional Rendering Hook

Create `src/hooks/usePermissions.ts`:

```tsx
import { useRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export function usePermissions() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const auth = router.options.context.auth;

  return {
    hasRole: auth.hasRole,
    hasAnyRole: auth.hasAnyRole,
    hasPermission: auth.hasPermission,
    hasAnyPermission: auth.hasAnyPermission,
    user: auth.user,
  };
}
```

### 2. Permission Guard Component

Create `src/components/PermissionGuard.tsx`:

```tsx
interface PermissionGuardProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  roles?: string[];
  permissions?: string[];
  requireAll?: boolean;
  fallback?: React.ReactNode;
}

export function PermissionGuard({
  children,
  roles = [],
  permissions = [],
  requireAll = false,
  fallback = null,
}: PermissionGuardProps) {
  const { hasAnyRole, hasAnyPermission, hasRole, hasPermission } = usePermissions();

  const hasRequiredRoles =
    roles.length === 0 ||
    (requireAll ? roles.every((role) => hasRole(role)) : hasAnyRole(roles));

  const hasRequiredPermissions =
    permissions.length === 0 ||
    (requireAll
      ? permissions.every((permission) => hasPermission(permission))
      : hasAnyPermission(permissions));

  if (hasRequiredRoles && hasRequiredPermissions) {
    return <>{children}</>;
  }

  return <>{fallback}</>;
}
```

### 3. Using Permission Guards

```tsx
import { PermissionGuard } from "../components/PermissionGuard";

function SomeComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>

      <PermissionGuard roles={["admin"]}>
        <button className="rounded bg-red-600 px-4 py-2 text-white">
          Admin Only Button
        </button>
      </PermissionGuard>

      <PermissionGuard
        permissions={["users:write"]}
        fallback={<p className="text-gray-500">You cannot edit users</p>}
      >
        <button className="rounded bg-blue-600 px-4 py-2 text-white">Edit Users</button>
      </PermissionGuard>

      <PermissionGuard
        roles={["admin", "moderator"]}
        permissions={["content:moderate"]}
        requireAll={true}
      >
        <button className="rounded bg-yellow-600 px-4 py-2 text-white">
          Moderate Content (Admin/Mod + Permission)
        </button>
      </PermissionGuard>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

## Advanced Permission Patterns

### 1. Resource-Based Permissions

```tsx
// Check if user can edit a specific resource
function canEditResource(auth: AuthState, resourceId: string, ownerId: string) {
  // Admin can edit anything
  if (auth.hasRole("admin")) return true;

  // Owner can edit their own resources
  if (auth.user?.id === ownerId && auth.hasPermission("resource:edit:own")) return true;

  // Moderators can edit with permission
  if (auth.hasRole("moderator") && auth.hasPermission("resource:edit:any")) return true;

  return false;
}

// Usage in component
function ResourceEditor({ resource }) {
  const { auth } = Route.useRouteContext();

  if (!canEditResource(auth, resource.id, resource.ownerId)) {
    return <div>You cannot edit this resource</div>;
  }

  return <EditForm resource={resource} />;
}
```

### 2. Time-Based Permissions

```tsx
function hasTimeBasedPermission(auth: AuthState, permission: string) {
  const userPermissions = auth.user?.permissions || [];
  const hasPermission = userPermissions.includes(permission);

  // Check if permission has time restrictions
  const timeRestricted = userPermissions.find((p) => p.startsWith(`${permission}:time:`));

  if (timeRestricted) {
    const [, , startHour, endHour] = timeRestricted.split(":");
    const currentHour = new Date().getHours();
    return currentHour >= parseInt(startHour) && currentHour <= parseInt(endHour);
  }

  return hasPermission;
}
```

## Common Problems

### Role/Permission Data Not Loading

**Problem:** User roles/permissions are undefined in routes.

**Solution:** Ensure your authentication API returns complete user data:

```tsx
const login = async (username: string, password: string) => {
  const response = await fetch("/api/login", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ username, password }),
  });

  if (response.ok) {
    const userData = await response.json();
    // Ensure userData includes roles and permissions
    console.log("User data:", userData); // Debug log
    setUser(userData);
    setIsAuthenticated(true);
  }
};
```

### Permission Checks Too Restrictive

**Problem:** Users locked out of areas they should access.

**Solution:** Use hierarchical permissions and role inheritance:

```tsx
const roleHierarchy = {
  admin: ["admin", "moderator", "user"],
  moderator: ["moderator", "user"],
  user: ["user"],
};

const hasRole = (requiredRole: string) => {
  const userRoles = user?.roles || [];
  return userRoles.some((userRole) => roleHierarchy[userRole]?.includes(requiredRole));
};
```

### Performance Issues with Many Permission Checks

**Problem:** Too many permission checks slowing down renders.

**Solution:** Memoize permission computations:

```tsx
import { useMemo } from "react";

function usePermissions() {
  const { auth } = Route.useRouteContext();

  const permissions = useMemo(
    () => ({
      canEditUsers: auth.hasPermission("users:write"),
      canDeleteUsers: auth.hasPermission("users:delete"),
      isAdmin: auth.hasRole("admin"),
      isModerator: auth.hasAnyRole(["admin", "moderator"]),
    }),
    [auth.user?.roles, auth.user?.permissions],
  );

  return permissions;
}
```

title: How to Set Up Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
---

> [!IMPORTANT] > **[TanStack Start](../guide/tanstack-start.md) is the recommended way to set up SSR** - it provides SSR, streaming, and deployment with zero configuration.
>
> Use the manual setup below only if you need to integrate with an existing server.

## Quick Start with TanStack Start

```bash
npx create-tsrouter-app@latest my-app --template start
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Manual SSR Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install express compression
npm install --save-dev @types/express
```

### 2. Create Shared Router Configuration

```tsx
// src/router.tsx
import { createRouter as createTanstackRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

export function createRouter() {
  return createTanstackRouter({
    routeTree,
    context: {
      head: "", // For server-side head injection
    },
    defaultPreload: "intent",
  });
}

declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
  interface Register {
    router: ReturnType<typeof createRouter>;
  }
}
```

### 3. Set Up Server Entry Point

```tsx
// src/entry-server.tsx
import { pipeline } from "node:stream/promises";
import {
  RouterServer,
  createRequestHandler,
  renderRouterToString,
} from "@tanstack/react-router/ssr/server";
import { createRouter } from "./router";
import type express from "express";

export async function render({
  req,
  res,
  head = "",
}: {
  head?: string;
  req: express.Request;
  res: express.Response;
}) {
  // Convert Express request to Web API Request
  const url = new URL(req.originalUrl || req.url, "https://localhost:3000").href;

  const request = new Request(url, {
    method: req.method,
    headers: (() => {
      const headers = new Headers();
      for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(req.headers)) {
        headers.set(key, value as any);
      }
      return headers;
    })(),
  });

  // Create request handler
  const handler = createRequestHandler({
    request,
    createRouter: () => {
      const router = createRouter();

      // Inject server context (like head tags from Vite)
      router.update({
        context: {
          ...router.options.context,
          head: head,
        },
      });
      return router;
    },
  });

  // Render to string (non-streaming)
  const response = await handler(({ responseHeaders, router }) =>
    renderRouterToString({
      responseHeaders,
      router,
      children: <RouterServer router={router} />,
    }),
  );

  // Convert Web API Response back to Express response
  res.statusMessage = response.statusText;
  res.status(response.status);

  response.headers.forEach((value, name) => {
    res.setHeader(name, value);
  });

  // Stream response body
  return pipeline(response.body as any, res);
}
```

### 4. Set Up Client Entry Point

```tsx
// src/entry-client.tsx
import { hydrateRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { RouterClient } from "@tanstack/react-router/ssr/client";
import { createRouter } from "./router";

const router = createRouter();

hydrateRoot(document, <RouterClient router={router} />);
```

### 5. Configure Vite for SSR

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import path from "node:path";
import url from "node:url";
import { TanStackRouterVite } from "@tanstack/router-plugin/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

const __filename = url.fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

export default defineConfig(({ isSsrBuild }) => ({
  plugins: [
    TanStackRouterVite({
      autoCodeSplitting: true,
    }),
    react(),
  ],
  build: isSsrBuild
    ? {
        // SSR build configuration
        ssr: true,
        outDir: "dist/server",
        emitAssets: true,
        copyPublicDir: false,
        rollupOptions: {
          input: path.resolve(__dirname, "src/entry-server.tsx"),
          output: {
            entryFileNames: "[name].js",
            chunkFileNames: "assets/[name]-[hash].js",
            assetFileNames: "assets/[name]-[hash][extname]",
          },
        },
      }
    : {
        // Client build configuration
        outDir: "dist/client",
        emitAssets: true,
        copyPublicDir: true,
        rollupOptions: {
          input: path.resolve(__dirname, "src/entry-client.tsx"),
          output: {
            entryFileNames: "[name].js",
            chunkFileNames: "assets/[name]-[hash].js",
            assetFileNames: "assets/[name]-[hash][extname]",
          },
        },
      },
}));
```

### 6. Update Root Route for HTML Structure

```tsx
// src/routes/__root.tsx
import { HeadContent, Outlet, createRootRouteWithContext } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from "@tanstack/react-router-devtools";

interface RouterContext {
  head: string;
}

export const Route = createRootRouteWithContext<RouterContext>()({
  head: () => ({
    links: [
      { rel: "icon", href: "/favicon.ico" },
      { rel: "apple-touch-icon", href: "/logo192.png" },
      { rel: "manifest", href: "/manifest.json" },
    ],
    meta: [
      {
        charSet: "UTF-8",
      },
      {
        name: "viewport",
        content: "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0",
      },
      {
        title: "TanStack Router SSR App",
      },
    ],
    scripts: [
      // Development scripts
      ...(!import.meta.env.PROD
        ? [
            {
              type: "module",
              children: `import RefreshRuntime from "/@react-refresh"
                RefreshRuntime.injectIntoGlobalHook(window)
                window.$RefreshReg$ = () => {}
                window.$RefreshSig$ = () => (type) => type
                window.__vite_plugin_react_preamble_installed__ = true`,
            },
            {
              type: "module",
              src: "/@vite/client",
            },
          ]
        : []),
      // Entry script
      {
        type: "module",
        src: import.meta.env.PROD ? "/entry-client.js" : "/src/entry-client.tsx",
      },
    ],
  }),
  component: RootComponent,
});

function RootComponent() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <HeadContent />
      </head>
      <body>
        <Outlet />
        <TanStackRouterDevtools />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### 7. Create Express Server

```js
// server.js
import path from "node:path";
import express from "express";
import compression from "compression";

const isTest = process.env.NODE_ENV === "test" || !!process.env.VITE_TEST_BUILD;

export async function createServer(
  root = process.cwd(),
  isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
  hmrPort = process.env.VITE_DEV_SERVER_PORT,
) {
  const app = express();

  let vite;
  if (!isProd) {
    // Development mode with Vite middleware
    vite = await (
      await import("vite")
    ).createServer({
      root,
      logLevel: isTest ? "error" : "info",
      server: {
        middlewareMode: true,
        watch: {
          usePolling: true,
          interval: 100,
        },
        hmr: {
          port: hmrPort,
        },
      },
      appType: "custom",
    });
    app.use(vite.middlewares);
  } else {
    // Production mode
    app.use(compression());
    app.use(express.static("./dist/client"));
  }

  app.use("*", async (req, res) => {
    try {
      const url = req.originalUrl;

      // Check for static assets
      if (path.extname(url) !== "") {
        console.warn(`${url} is not a valid router path`);
        res.status(404).end(`${url} is not a valid router path`);
        return;
      }

      // Extract head content from Vite in development
      let viteHead = "";
      if (!isProd) {
        const transformedHtml = await vite.transformIndexHtml(
          url,
          `<html><head></head><body></body></html>`,
        );
        viteHead = transformedHtml.substring(
          transformedHtml.indexOf("<head>") + 6,
          transformedHtml.indexOf("</head>"),
        );
      }

      // Load server entry
      const entry = await (async () => {
        if (!isProd) {
          return vite.ssrLoadModule("/src/entry-server.tsx");
        } else {
          return import("./dist/server/entry-server.js");
        }
      })();

      console.info("Rendering:", url);
      await entry.render({ req, res, head: viteHead });
    } catch (e) {
      !isProd && vite.ssrFixStacktrace(e);
      console.error(e.stack);
      res.status(500).end(e.stack);
    }
  });

  return { app, vite };
}

if (!isTest) {
  createServer().then(({ app }) =>
    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.info("Server running at http://localhost:3000");
    }),
  );
}
```

### 8. Update Package Scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "node server.js",
    "build": "npm run build:client && npm run build:server",
    "build:client": "vite build",
    "build:server": "vite build --ssr",
    "start": "NODE_ENV=production node server.js"
  }
}
```

## Streaming SSR

For better performance, enable streaming SSR by replacing `renderRouterToString` with `renderRouterToStream`:

```tsx
// src/entry-server.tsx
import { renderRouterToStream } from "@tanstack/react-router/ssr/server";

// Replace renderRouterToString with:
const response = await handler(({ request, responseHeaders, router }) =>
  renderRouterToStream({
    request,
    responseHeaders,
    router,
    children: <RouterServer router={router} />,
  }),
);
```

### Streaming Vite Configuration

For streaming SSR, update your Vite config:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig(({ isSsrBuild }) => ({
  plugins: [
    TanStackRouterVite({
      autoCodeSplitting: true,
      enableStreaming: true, // Enable streaming support
    }),
    react(),
  ],
  // ... rest of config
  ssr: {
    optimizeDeps: {
      include: ["@tanstack/react-router/ssr/server"],
    },
  },
}));
```

## Common Problems

> [!TIP] > **Most of these problems are automatically solved by [TanStack Start](../guide/tanstack-start.md).** The issues below are primarily relevant for manual SSR setups.

### React Import Errors

**Problem:** `ReferenceError: React is not defined` during SSR

**Solution:** Ensure React is properly imported in components:

```tsx
// In your route components
import React from "react"; // Add explicit import
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  component: () => <div>Hello World</div>, // React is now available
});
```

### Hydration Mismatches

**Problem:** Client HTML doesn't match server HTML

**Solution:** Ensure consistent rendering between server and client:

```tsx
// Use useIsomorphicLayoutEffect for browser-only effects
import { useLayoutEffect, useEffect } from "react";

const useIsomorphicLayoutEffect =
  typeof window !== "undefined" ? useLayoutEffect : useEffect;

function MyComponent() {
  useIsomorphicLayoutEffect(() => {
    // Browser-only code that won't cause hydration mismatches
  }, []);
}
```

### Bun Runtime Issues

**Problem:** `Cannot find module "react-dom/server"` with Bun

**Solution:** Use Node.js compatibility or create Bun-specific builds:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:bun": "bun build --target=bun --outdir=dist/bun src/entry-server.tsx"
  }
}
```

### Module Resolution Errors

**Problem:** SSR modules not resolving correctly

**Solution:** Configure Vite SSR externals:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  ssr: {
    noExternal: [
      // Packages that need to be bundled for SSR
      "@tanstack/react-router",
    ],
    external: [
      // Packages that should remain external
      "express",
    ],
  },
});
```

### Streaming Configuration Issues

**Problem:** Streaming SSR not working with existing Vite setup

**Solution:** Ensure proper streaming configuration:

```ts
// vite.config.ts - Additional streaming config
export default defineConfig({
  define: {
    "process.env.STREAMING_SSR": JSON.stringify(true),
  },
  optimizeDeps: {
    include: ["@tanstack/react-router/ssr/server"],
  },
});
```

### Build Output Issues

**Problem:** Server build missing assets or incorrect paths

**Solution:** Verify build configuration:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
const ssrConfig = {
  ssr: true,
  outDir: "dist/server",
  ssrEmitAssets: true, // Important for asset handling
  copyPublicDir: false,
  rollupOptions: {
    input: path.resolve(__dirname, "src/entry-server.tsx"),
    external: ["express", "compression"], // External deps
  },
};
```

# How to Set Up Testing with Code-Based Routing

This guide covers setting up comprehensive testing for TanStack Router applications that use code-based routing, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing strategies.

## Quick Start

Set up testing by configuring your test framework (Vitest/Jest), creating router test utilities, and implementing patterns for testing navigation, route components, and data loading with manually defined routes.

> **Using File-Based Routing?** See [How to Test File-Based Routing](./test-file-based-routing.md) for patterns specific to file-based routing applications.

---

## Configure Test Framework

### 1. Install Dependencies

For **Vitest** (recommended):

```bash
npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jsdom
```

For **Jest**:

```bash
npm install -D jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jest-environment-jsdom
```

### 2. Configure Vitest

Create `vitest.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  test: {
    environment: "jsdom",
    setupFiles: ["./src/test/setup.ts"],
    typecheck: { enabled: true },
    watch: false,
  },
});
```

### 3. Create Test Setup

Create `src/test/setup.ts`:

```ts
import "@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest";

// @ts-expect-error
global.IS_REACT_ACT_ENVIRONMENT = true;
```

---

## Code-Based Router Testing Patterns

The following patterns are specifically designed for applications using code-based routing where you manually create routes with `createRoute()` and build route trees programmatically.

### 1. TanStack Router Internal Pattern (Recommended)

The TanStack Router team uses this pattern internally for testing router components:

```tsx
import { beforeEach, afterEach, describe, expect, test, vi } from "vitest";
import { cleanup, render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import {
  RouterProvider,
  createBrowserHistory,
  createRootRoute,
  createRoute,
  createRouter,
} from "@tanstack/react-router";
import type { RouterHistory } from "@tanstack/react-router";

let history: RouterHistory;

beforeEach(() => {
  history = createBrowserHistory();
  expect(window.location.pathname).toBe("/");
});

afterEach(() => {
  history.destroy();
  window.history.replaceState(null, "root", "/");
  vi.clearAllMocks();
  vi.resetAllMocks();
  cleanup();
});

describe("Router Component Testing", () => {
  test("should render route component", async () => {
    const rootRoute = createRootRoute();
    const indexRoute = createRoute({
      getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
      path: "/",
      component: () => <h1>IndexTitle</h1>,
    });

    const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([indexRoute]);
    const router = createRouter({ routeTree, history });

    render(<RouterProvider router={router} />);

    expect(await screen.findByText("IndexTitle")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### 2. Alternative: Router Test Utilities (For Simpler Cases)

Create `src/test/router-utils.tsx`:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { render, RenderOptions } from "@testing-library/react";
import {
  createRouter,
  createRootRoute,
  createRoute,
  RouterProvider,
  Outlet,
} from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { createMemoryHistory } from "@tanstack/react-router";

// Create a root route for testing
const rootRoute = createRootRoute({
  component: () => <Outlet />,
});

// Test router factory
export function createTestRouter(routes: any[], initialLocation = "/") {
  const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren(routes);

  const router = createRouter({
    routeTree,
    history: createMemoryHistory({
      initialEntries: [initialLocation],
    }),
  });

  return router;
}

// Wrapper component for testing
interface RouterWrapperProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  router: any;
}

function RouterWrapper({ children, router }: RouterWrapperProps) {
  return <RouterProvider router={router}>{children}</RouterProvider>;
}

// Custom render function with router
interface RenderWithRouterOptions extends Omit<RenderOptions, "wrapper"> {
  router?: any;
  initialLocation?: string;
  routes?: any[];
}

export function renderWithRouter(
  ui: React.ReactElement,
  {
    router,
    initialLocation = "/",
    routes = [],
    ...renderOptions
  }: RenderWithRouterOptions = {},
) {
  if (!router && routes.length > 0) {
    router = createTestRouter(routes, initialLocation);
  }

  if (!router) {
    throw new Error("Router is required. Provide either a router or routes array.");
  }

  function Wrapper({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
    return <RouterWrapper router={router}>{children}</RouterWrapper>;
  }

  return {
    ...render(ui, { wrapper: Wrapper, ...renderOptions }),
    router,
  };
}
```

### 2. Mock Route Factory

Create `src/test/mock-routes.tsx`:

```tsx
import { createRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { rootRoute } from "./router-utils";

export const createMockRoute = (
  path: string,
  component: React.ComponentType,
  options: any = {},
) => {
  return createRoute({
    getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
    path,
    component,
    ...options,
  });
};

// Common test components
export function TestComponent({ title = "Test" }: { title?: string }) {
  return <div data-testid="test-component">{title}</div>;
}

export function LoadingComponent() {
  return <div data-testid="loading">Loading...</div>;
}

export function ErrorComponent({ error }: { error: Error }) {
  return <div data-testid="error">Error: {error.message}</div>;
}
```

## Test Code-Based Route Components

### 1. Basic Component Testing

```tsx
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import { createRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { renderWithRouter, rootRoute, TestComponent } from "../test/router-utils";

describe("Code-Based Route Component Testing", () => {
  it("should render route component", () => {
    const testRoute = createRoute({
      getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
      path: "/",
      component: TestComponent,
    });

    renderWithRouter(<div />, {
      routes: [testRoute],
      initialLocation: "/",
    });

    expect(screen.getByTestId("test-component")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it("should render component with props from route context", () => {
    function ComponentWithContext() {
      const { title } = Route.useLoaderData();
      return <div data-testid="context-component">{title}</div>;
    }

    const contextRoute = createRoute({
      getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
      path: "/context",
      component: ComponentWithContext,
      loader: () => ({ title: "From Context" }),
    });

    renderWithRouter(<div />, {
      routes: [contextRoute],
      initialLocation: "/context",
    });

    expect(screen.getByText("From Context")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### 2. Testing Route Parameters

```tsx
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import { createRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { renderWithRouter, rootRoute } from "../test/router-utils";

describe("Route Parameters", () => {
  it("should handle route params correctly", () => {
    function UserProfile() {
      const { userId } = Route.useParams();
      return <div data-testid="user-profile">User: {userId}</div>;
    }

    const userRoute = createRoute({
      getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
      path: "/users/$userId",
      component: UserProfile,
    });

    renderWithRouter(<div />, {
      routes: [userRoute],
      initialLocation: "/users/123",
    });

    expect(screen.getByText("User: 123")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it("should handle search params correctly", () => {
    function SearchPage() {
      const { q, page } = Route.useSearch();
      return (
        <div data-testid="search-results">
          Query: {q}, Page: {page}
        </div>
      );
    }

    const searchRoute = createRoute({
      getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
      path: "/search",
      component: SearchPage,
      validateSearch: (search) => ({
        q: (search.q as string) || "",
        page: Number(search.page) || 1,
      }),
    });

    renderWithRouter(<div />, {
      routes: [searchRoute],
      initialLocation: "/search?q=react&page=2",
    });

    expect(screen.getByText("Query: react, Page: 2")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

## Test Navigation

### 1. Testing Link Components

```tsx
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { screen, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";
import { Link, createRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { renderWithRouter, rootRoute, TestComponent } from "../test/router-utils";

describe("Code-Based Route Navigation", () => {
  it("should navigate when link is clicked", async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup();

    function HomePage() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Home</h1>
          <Link to="/about" data-testid="about-link">
            About
          </Link>
        </div>
      );
    }

    function AboutPage() {
      return <h1>About Page</h1>;
    }

    const homeRoute = createRoute({
      getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
      path: "/",
      component: HomePage,
    });

    const aboutRoute = createRoute({
      getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
      path: "/about",
      component: AboutPage,
    });

    const { router } = renderWithRouter(<div />, {
      routes: [homeRoute, aboutRoute],
      initialLocation: "/",
    });

    // Initial state
    expect(screen.getByText("Home")).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(router.state.location.pathname).toBe("/");

    // Click link
    await user.click(screen.getByTestId("about-link"));

    // Check navigation
    expect(screen.getByText("About Page")).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(router.state.location.pathname).toBe("/about");
  });

  it("should navigate programmatically", async () => {
    function NavigationTest() {
      const navigate = Route.useNavigate();

      const handleNavigate = () => {
        navigate({ to: "/dashboard", search: { tab: "settings" } });
      };

      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Navigation Test</h1>
          <button onClick={handleNavigate} data-testid="navigate-btn">
            Go to Dashboard
          </button>
        </div>
      );
    }

    const testRoute = createRoute({
      getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
      path: "/",
      component: NavigationTest,
    });

    const dashboardRoute = createRoute({
      getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
      path: "/dashboard",
      component: () => <h1>Dashboard</h1>,
      validateSearch: (search) => ({
        tab: (search.tab as string) || "general",
      }),
    });

    const { router } = renderWithRouter(<div />, {
      routes: [testRoute, dashboardRoute],
      initialLocation: "/",
    });

    await userEvent.click(screen.getByTestId("navigate-btn"));

    expect(router.state.location.pathname).toBe("/dashboard");
    expect(router.state.location.search).toEqual({ tab: "settings" });
  });
});
```

### 2. Testing Route Guards

```tsx
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import { createRoute, redirect } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { renderWithRouter, rootRoute } from "../test/router-utils";

describe("Code-Based Route Guards", () => {
  it("should redirect unauthenticated users", () => {
    const mockAuth = { isAuthenticated: false };

    function ProtectedPage() {
      return <h1>Protected Content</h1>;
    }

    function LoginPage() {
      return <h1>Login Required</h1>;
    }

    const protectedRoute = createRoute({
      getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
      path: "/protected",
      component: ProtectedPage,
      beforeLoad: ({ context }) => {
        if (!mockAuth.isAuthenticated) {
          throw redirect({ to: "/login" });
        }
      },
    });

    const loginRoute = createRoute({
      getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
      path: "/login",
      component: LoginPage,
    });

    renderWithRouter(<div />, {
      routes: [protectedRoute, loginRoute],
      initialLocation: "/protected",
    });

    // Should redirect to login
    expect(screen.getByText("Login Required")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it("should allow authenticated users", () => {
    const mockAuth = { isAuthenticated: true };

    function ProtectedPage() {
      return <h1>Protected Content</h1>;
    }

    const protectedRoute = createRoute({
      getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
      path: "/protected",
      component: ProtectedPage,
      beforeLoad: ({ context }) => {
        if (!mockAuth.isAuthenticated) {
          throw redirect({ to: "/login" });
        }
      },
    });

    renderWithRouter(<div />, {
      routes: [protectedRoute],
      initialLocation: "/protected",
    });

    expect(screen.getByText("Protected Content")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

## Test Data Loading

### 1. Testing Loaders

### 2. Testing with React Query

```tsx
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from "vitest";
import { screen, waitFor } from "@testing-library/react";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { createRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { renderWithRouter, rootRoute } from "../test/router-utils";

describe("React Query Integration", () => {
  it("should work with React Query", async () => {

      },
    });

    const mockFetchPosts = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue([
      { id: 1, title: "Post 1" },
      { id: 2, title: "Post 2" },
    ]);

    function PostsList() {
      const posts = Route.useLoaderData();
      return (
        <div data-testid="posts-list">
          {posts.map((post: any) => (
            <div key={post.id}>{post.title}</div>
          ))}
        </div>
      );
    }

    const postsRoute = createRoute({
      getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
      path: "/posts",
      component: PostsList,
      loader: ({ context: { queryClient } }) =>
        queryClient.ensureQueryData({
          queryKey: ["posts"],
          queryFn: mockFetchPosts,
        }),
    });

    function TestWrapper({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
      return <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>{children}</QueryClientProvider>;
    }

    renderWithRouter(<div />, {
      routes: [postsRoute],
      initialLocation: "/posts",
      wrapper: TestWrapper,
    });

    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText("Post 1")).toBeInTheDocument();
      expect(screen.getByText("Post 2")).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });
});
```

## Test with Context

### 1. Testing Router Context

```tsx
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import { createRootRouteWithContext, createRoute, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";

interface RouterContext {
  auth: {
    user: { id: string; name: string } | null;
    isAuthenticated: boolean;
  };
}

describe("Code-Based Router Context", () => {
  it("should provide context to routes", () => {
    const rootRouteWithContext = createRootRouteWithContext<RouterContext>()({
      component: () => <Outlet />,
    });

    function UserDashboard() {
      const { auth } = Route.useRouteContext();
      return <div data-testid="dashboard">Welcome, {auth.user?.name || "Guest"}!</div>;
    }

    const dashboardRoute = createRoute({
      getParentRoute: () => rootRouteWithContext,
      path: "/dashboard",
      component: UserDashboard,
    });

    const mockContext = {
      auth: {
        user: { id: "1", name: "John Doe" },
        isAuthenticated: true,
      },
    };

    const router = createRouter({
      routeTree: rootRouteWithContext.addChildren([dashboardRoute]),
      context: mockContext,
      history: createMemoryHistory({
        initialEntries: ["/dashboard"],
      }),
    });

    render(<RouterProvider router={router} />);

    expect(screen.getByText("Welcome, John Doe!")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

## E2E Testing with Playwright

### 1. Playwright Configuration

Create `playwright.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from "@playwright/test";

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: "./e2e",
  fullyParallel: true,
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  reporter: "html",
  use: {
    baseURL: "http://localhost:3000",
    trace: "on-first-retry",
  },
  projects: [
    {
      name: "chromium",
      use: { ...devices["Desktop Chrome"] },
    },
  ],
  webServer: {
    command: "npm run dev",
    url: "http://localhost:3000",
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
});
```

### 2. E2E Test Example

Create `e2e/navigation.spec.ts`:

```ts
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

test.describe("Code-Based Router Navigation", () => {
  test("should navigate between pages", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto("/");

    // Check home page
    await expect(page.locator("h1")).toContainText("Home");

    // Navigate to about page
    await page.click("text=About");
    await expect(page).toHaveURL("/about");
    await expect(page.locator("h1")).toContainText("About");

    // Use browser back button
    await page.goBack();
    await expect(page).toHaveURL("/");
    await expect(page.locator("h1")).toContainText("Home");
  });

  test("should handle search parameters", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto("/search?q=react");

    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="search-input"]')).toHaveValue("react");
    await expect(page).toHaveURL("/search?q=react");

    // Update search
    await page.fill('[data-testid="search-input"]', "vue");
    await page.press('[data-testid="search-input"]', "Enter");

    await expect(page).toHaveURL("/search?q=vue");
  });

  test("should handle authentication flow", async ({ page }) => {
    // Try to access protected route
    await page.goto("/dashboard");

    // Should redirect to login
    await expect(page).toHaveURL("/login");

    // Login
    await page.fill('[data-testid="username"]', "testuser");
    await page.fill('[data-testid="password"]', "password");
    await page.click('[data-testid="login-btn"]');

    // Should redirect back to dashboard
    await expect(page).toHaveURL("/dashboard");
    await expect(page.locator("h1")).toContainText("Dashboard");
  });
});
```

## Code-Based Routing Testing Best Practices

### 1. Test Organization

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Header.tsx
│   └── Header.test.tsx
├── routes/
│   ├── posts.tsx     # Code-based route definitions
│   ├── posts.test.tsx
│   └── index.tsx
├── test/
│   ├── setup.ts
│   ├── router-utils.tsx  # Code-based router utilities
│   └── mock-routes.tsx   # Manual route factories
└── __tests__/
    ├── integration/
    └── e2e/
```

### 2. Common Patterns

```tsx
// Mock external dependencies for code-based routes
vi.mock("../api/users", () => ({
  fetchUser: vi.fn(),
  updateUser: vi.fn(),
}));

// Test utility for common code-based route setups
export function createAuthenticatedRouter(user = mockUser) {
  // Manually create routes for testing
  const protectedRoutes = [
    createRoute({
      getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
      path: "/dashboard",
      component: DashboardComponent,
    }),
  ];

  return createTestRouter(protectedRoutes, {
    context: {
      auth: { user, isAuthenticated: true },
    },
  });
}

// Group related tests
describe("User Management", () => {
  describe("when authenticated", () => {
    it("should show user dashboard", () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });

  describe("when not authenticated", () => {
    it("should redirect to login", () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

## Common Problems

### Test Environment Issues

**Problem:** Tests fail with "window is not defined" errors.

**Solution:** Ensure jsdom environment is configured:

```ts
// vitest.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    environment: "jsdom",
  },
});
```

### Router Context Missing

**Problem:** Components can't access router context in tests.

**Solution:** Use the custom render function with router:

```tsx
// ✅ Correct
renderWithRouter(<Component />, { routes, initialLocation });

// ❌ Wrong
render(<Component />);
```

### Async Data Loading

**Problem:** Tests fail because they don't wait for data loading.

**Solution:** Use proper async testing patterns:

```tsx
await waitFor(() => {
  expect(screen.getByText("Loaded Data")).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

title: Share Search Parameters Across Routes
---

# How to Share Search Parameters Across Routes

Search parameters automatically inherit from parent routes in TanStack Router. When a parent route validates search parameters, child routes can access them via `Route.useSearch()` alongside their own parameters.

## How Parameter Inheritance Works

TanStack Router automatically merges search parameters from parent routes with child route parameters. This happens through the route hierarchy:

1. **Parent route** validates shared parameters with `validateSearch`
2. **Child routes** automatically inherit those validated parameters
3. **`Route.useSearch()`** returns both local and inherited parameters

## Global Parameters via Root Route

Share parameters across your entire application by validating them in the root route:

```tsx
// routes/__root.tsx
import { createRootRoute, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { zodValidator } from "@tanstack/zod-adapter";
import { z } from "zod";

const globalSearchSchema = z.object({
  theme: z.enum(["light", "dark"]).default("light"),
  lang: z.enum(["en", "es", "fr"]).default("en"),
  debug: z.boolean().default(false),
});

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  validateSearch: zodValidator(globalSearchSchema),
  component: RootComponent,
});

function RootComponent() {
  const { theme, lang, debug } = Route.useSearch();

  return (
    <div className={`app theme-${theme} lang-${lang}`}>
      {debug && <DebugPanel />}
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

```tsx
// routes/products/index.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { zodValidator } from "@tanstack/zod-adapter";
import { z } from "zod";

const productSearchSchema = z.object({
  page: z.number().default(1),
  category: z.string().default("all"),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/products/")({
  validateSearch: zodValidator(productSearchSchema),
  component: ProductsPage,
});

function ProductsPage() {
  // Contains both local (page, category) AND inherited (theme, lang, debug) parameters
  const search = Route.useSearch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Products (Theme: {search.theme})</h1>
      <p>Page: {search.page}</p>
      <p>Category: {search.category}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Section-Specific Parameters via Layout Routes

Share parameters within a section of your app using layout routes:

```tsx
// routes/_authenticated.tsx
import { createFileRoute, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { zodValidator } from "@tanstack/zod-adapter";
import { z } from "zod";

const authSearchSchema = z.object({
  impersonate: z.string().optional(),
  sidebar: z.boolean().default(true),
  notifications: z.boolean().default(true),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/_authenticated")({
  validateSearch: zodValidator(authSearchSchema),
  component: AuthenticatedLayout,
});

function AuthenticatedLayout() {
  const search = Route.useSearch();

  return (
    <div className="authenticated-layout">
      {search.sidebar && <Sidebar />}
      <main className="main-content">
        {search.notifications && <NotificationBar />}
        <Outlet />
      </main>
      {search.impersonate && <ImpersonationBanner user={search.impersonate} />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

```tsx
// routes/_authenticated/dashboard.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/_authenticated/dashboard")({
  component: DashboardPage,
});

function DashboardPage() {
  // Contains inherited auth parameters (impersonate, sidebar, notifications)
  const search = Route.useSearch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Dashboard</h1>
      {search.impersonate && <Alert>Currently impersonating: {search.impersonate}</Alert>}
      <DashboardContent />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Common Use Cases

**Global Application Settings:**

- Theme, language, timezone
- Debug flags, feature toggles
- Analytics tracking (UTM parameters)

**Section-Specific State:**

- Authentication context (user role, impersonation)
- Layout preferences (sidebar, density)
- Workspace or organization context

**Persistent UI State:**

- Modal visibility, drawer state
- Filter presets, view modes
- Accessibility preferences

## Common Problems

### Problem: Parameters Not Inheriting

**Cause**: Parent route not validating the shared parameters.

```tsx
// ❌ Root route missing validateSearch
export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: RootComponent, // No validateSearch
});

// Child route can't access theme parameter
function ProductsPage() {
  const search = Route.useSearch(); // No theme available
}
```

**Solution**: Add `validateSearch` to the parent route:

```tsx
// ✅ Root route validates shared parameters
export const Route = createRootRoute({
  validateSearch: zodValidator(globalSearchSchema),
  component: RootComponent,
});
```

### Problem: Navigation Loses Shared Parameters

**Cause**: Not preserving inherited parameters during navigation.

```tsx
// ❌ Navigation overwrites all search parameters
router.navigate({
  to: "/products",
  search: { page: 1 }, // Loses theme, lang, etc.
});
```

**Solution**: Preserve existing parameters with function syntax:

```tsx
// ✅ Preserve existing parameters
router.navigate({
  to: "/products",
  search: (prev) => ({ ...prev, page: 1 }),
});
```

### Problem: Type Errors with Inherited Parameters

**Cause**: Child route schema doesn't account for inherited parameters.

```tsx
// ❌ TypeScript error: Property 'theme' doesn't exist
const search = Route.useSearch();
console.log(search.theme); // Type error
```

**Solution**: TypeScript automatically infers inherited types when using `validateSearch`. No additional typing needed - the inheritance works automatically.

## Production Checklist

- [ ] **Clear ownership**: Document which route validates which shared parameters
- [ ] **Avoid conflicts**: Use distinct parameter names across route levels
- [ ] **Preserve on navigation**: Use function syntax to maintain inherited parameters
- [ ] **Minimal URLs**: Only include essential shared parameters
- [ ] **Graceful defaults**: Provide fallback values for all shared parameters

<!--

title: How to Test Router with File-Based Routing
---

This guide covers testing TanStack Router applications that use file-based routing, including testing route generation, file-based route components, and file-based routing patterns.

## Quick Start

Test file-based routing by setting up route mocking utilities, testing generated route trees, and implementing patterns specific to file-based route structures and conventions.

---

## Understanding File-Based Routing Testing

File-based routing testing differs from code-based routing testing in several key ways:

- **Generated Route Trees**: Routes are automatically generated from filesystem structure
- **File Conventions**: Routes follow specific file naming conventions (`index.tsx`, `route.tsx`, `$param.tsx`)
- **Route Discovery**: Routes are discovered through filesystem scanning rather than explicit imports
- **Type Generation**: Route types are automatically generated and need special testing considerations

---

## Setting Up File-Based Route Testing

### 1. Install Test Dependencies

For file-based routing testing, you'll need the same base dependencies as regular router testing:

```bash
npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jsdom
```

### 2. Configure Test Environment

Create `vitest.config.ts` with file-based routing support:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vitest/config";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { TanStackRouterVite } from "@tanstack/router-plugin/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    TanStackRouterVite({
      // Configure for test environment
      routesDirectory: "./src/routes",
      generatedRouteTree: "./src/routeTree.gen.ts",
      disableLogging: true,
    }),
    react(),
  ],
  test: {
    environment: "jsdom",
    setupFiles: ["./src/test/setup.ts"],
    typecheck: { enabled: true },
    watch: false,
    // Ensure route tree is generated before tests
    globals: true,
  },
});
```

### 3. Create Route Testing Utilities

Create `src/test/file-route-utils.tsx`:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { render, RenderOptions } from "@testing-library/react";
import {
  createRouter,
  RouterProvider,
  createMemoryHistory,
} from "@tanstack/react-router";

// Import the generated route tree
import { routeTree } from "../routeTree.gen";

// Create test router with generated route tree
export function createTestRouterFromFiles(initialLocation = "/") {
  const router = createRouter({
    routeTree,
    history: createMemoryHistory({
      initialEntries: [initialLocation],
    }),
    context: {
      // Add any required context for your routes
    },
  });

  return router;
}

// Custom render function for file-based routes
interface RenderWithFileRoutesOptions extends Omit<RenderOptions, "wrapper"> {
  initialLocation?: string;
  routerContext?: any;
}

export function renderWithFileRoutes(
  ui: React.ReactElement,
  {
    initialLocation = "/",
    routerContext = {},
    ...renderOptions
  }: RenderWithFileRoutesOptions = {},
) {
  const router = createRouter({
    routeTree,
    history: createMemoryHistory({
      initialEntries: [initialLocation],
    }),
    context: routerContext,
  });

  function Wrapper({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
    return <RouterProvider router={router}>{children}</RouterProvider>;
  }

  return {
    ...render(ui, { wrapper: Wrapper, ...renderOptions }),
    router,
  };
}

// Helper to test specific file routes
export function createMockFileRoute(path: string, component: React.ComponentType) {
  // This is useful for isolated testing when you don't want to use the full route tree
  return {
    path,
    component,
    // Add other common route properties as needed
  };
}
```

---

## Testing File-Based Route Structure

### 1. Test Route Tree Generation

```tsx
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { routeTree } from "../routeTree.gen";

describe("Generated Route Tree", () => {
  it("should generate route tree from file structure", () => {
    // Test that route tree exists and has expected structure
    expect(routeTree).toBeDefined();
    expect(routeTree.children).toBeDefined();
  });

  it("should include all expected routes", () => {
    // Get all route paths from the generated tree
    const getAllRoutePaths = (tree: any, paths: string[] = []): string[] => {
      if (tree.path) {
        paths.push(tree.path);
      }
      if (tree.children) {
        tree.children.forEach((child: any) => {
          getAllRoutePaths(child, paths);
        });
      }
      return paths;
    };

    const routePaths = getAllRoutePaths(routeTree);

    // Test that expected routes are present
    expect(routePaths).toContain("/");
    expect(routePaths).toContain("/about");
    // Add assertions for your specific routes
  });

  it("should have correct route hierarchy", () => {
    // Test parent-child relationships
    const homeRoute = routeTree.children?.find((child: any) => child.path === "/");
    expect(homeRoute).toBeDefined();

    // Test for specific route structure based on your file organization
    // For example, if you have /posts/$postId routes:
    // const postsRoute = routeTree.children?.find((child: any) => child.path === '/posts')
    // expect(postsRoute?.children).toBeDefined()
  });
});
```

### 2. Test File Route Conventions

```tsx
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import { renderWithFileRoutes } from "../test/file-route-utils";

describe("File Route Conventions", () => {
  it("should render index route at root path", () => {
    renderWithFileRoutes(<div />, {
      initialLocation: "/",
    });

    // Test that the index route component renders
    // This depends on what your src/routes/index.tsx exports
    expect(screen.getByText("Welcome Home!")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it("should handle route parameters from filename", () => {
    // If you have a route like src/routes/posts/$postId.tsx
    renderWithFileRoutes(<div />, {
      initialLocation: "/posts/123",
    });

    // Test that parameter is correctly parsed from file-based route
    expect(screen.getByText(/Post.*123/)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it("should handle nested routes from directory structure", () => {
    // If you have src/routes/dashboard/settings.tsx
    renderWithFileRoutes(<div />, {
      initialLocation: "/dashboard/settings",
    });

    expect(screen.getByText(/Settings/)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it("should handle layout routes", () => {
    // If you have src/routes/_layout.tsx
    renderWithFileRoutes(<div />, {
      initialLocation: "/some-nested-route",
    });

    // Test that layout is rendered for nested routes
    expect(screen.getByTestId("layout-header")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

---

## Testing File-Based Route Components

### 1. Test Individual Route Files

```tsx

## E2E Testing for File-Based Routes

### 1. Playwright Configuration for File-Based Routes

Create `e2e/file-routing.spec.ts`:

```ts
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

test.describe("File-Based Route E2E", () => {
  test("should navigate through file-based route structure", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto("/");

    // Test home route (from src/routes/index.tsx)
    await expect(page.locator("h3")).toContainText("Welcome Home!");

    // Navigate to about route (from src/routes/about.tsx)
    await page.click("text=About");
    await expect(page).toHaveURL("/about");
    await expect(page.locator("h3")).toContainText("About");

    // Test browser navigation
    await page.goBack();
    await expect(page).toHaveURL("/");
  });

  test("should handle dynamic routes from file structure", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto("/posts");

    // Click on a dynamic post link (from src/routes/posts/$postId.tsx)
    await page.click('[data-testid="post-link-1"]');
    await expect(page).toHaveURL("/posts/1");
    await expect(page.locator("h1")).toContainText("Post 1");
  });

  test("should handle nested routes", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto("/dashboard");

    // Navigate to nested route (from src/routes/dashboard/settings.tsx)
    await page.click("text=Settings");
    await expect(page).toHaveURL("/dashboard/settings");
    await expect(page.locator("h2")).toContainText("Settings");
  });
});
```

## Common File-Based Routing Testing Patterns

### 1. Mock Route Files for Testing

```tsx
// src/test/mock-file-routes.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

// Mock individual route for isolated testing
export const createMockFileRoute = (
  path: string,
  component: React.ComponentType,
  options: any = {},
) => {
  return createFileRoute(path)({
    component,
    ...options,
  });
};

// Common test route components
export const TestHomeRoute = createMockFileRoute("/", () => (
  <div data-testid="home">Home Page</div>
));

export const TestAboutRoute = createMockFileRoute("/about", () => (
  <div data-testid="about">About Page</div>
));

export const TestDynamicRoute = createMockFileRoute("/posts/$postId", () => {
  const { postId } = Route.useParams();
  return <div data-testid="post">Post {postId}</div>;
});
```

### 2. Test Route Discovery

```tsx
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";

describe("Route Discovery", () => {
  it("should discover all routes from file structure", () => {
    // Test that your route tree includes all expected routes
    // This helps catch when routes are accidentally not being generated

    const expectedRoutes = [
      "/",
      "/about",
      "/posts",
      "/posts/$postId",
      "/dashboard",
      "/dashboard/settings",
    ];

    expectedRoutes.forEach((routePath) => {
      const routeExists = checkRouteExists(routeTree, routePath);
      expect(routeExists).toBe(true);
    });
  });
});

function checkRouteExists(tree: any, path: string): boolean {
  // Implementation to check if route exists in tree
  // This depends on your route tree structure
  return true; // Simplified
}
```

## Best Practices for File-Based Route Testing

### 1. Test Organization

```
src/
├── routes/
│   ├── __root.tsx
│   ├── index.tsx
│   ├── about.tsx
│   ├── posts/
│   │   ├── index.tsx
│   │   └── $postId.tsx
├── test/
│   ├── setup.ts
│   ├── file-route-utils.tsx
│   └── routes/
│       ├── index.test.tsx
│       ├── about.test.tsx
│       └── posts/
│           ├── index.test.tsx
│           └── $postId.test.tsx
```

### 2. Common Test Patterns

```tsx
// Test file for each route file
describe("Posts Route (/posts)", () => {
  it("should render posts list", () => {
    renderWithFileRoutes(<div />, {
      initialLocation: "/posts",
    });

    expect(screen.getByText(/Posts/)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it("should handle loading state", () => {
    // Test pending state for route with loader
  });

  it("should handle error state", () => {
    // Test error handling for route
  });
});

// Test route groups
describe("Dashboard Routes", () => {
  describe("/dashboard", () => {
    // Dashboard index tests
  });

  describe("/dashboard/settings", () => {
    // Settings route tests
  });
});
```

## Troubleshooting File-Based Route Testing

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Route tree not found in tests

```bash
Error: Cannot find module '../routeTree.gen'
```

**Solution**: Ensure route tree generation in test setup:

```ts
// vitest.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    TanStackRouterVite(), // Ensure this runs before tests
    react(),
  ],
  test: {
    setupFiles: ["./src/test/setup.ts"],
  },
});
```

**Problem**: Routes not updating in tests after file changes

**Solution**: Clear module cache in test setup:

```ts
// src/test/setup.ts
beforeEach(() => {
  vi.clearAllMocks();
  // Clear route tree cache if needed
  delete require.cache[require.resolve("../routeTree.gen")];
});
```

**Problem**: Type errors in tests with generated routes

**Solution**: Ensure proper TypeScript configuration:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["vitest/globals", "@testing-library/jest-dom"],
    "moduleResolution": "bundler"
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*", "src/routeTree.gen.ts"]
}
```

title: How to Use Environment Variables
---

Learn how to configure and use environment variables in your TanStack Router application for API endpoints, feature flags, and build configuration across different bundlers.

## Quick Start

Environment variables in TanStack Router are primarily used for client-side configuration and must follow bundler-specific naming conventions for security.

```bash
# .env
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
VITE_ENABLE_DEVTOOLS=true
```

```typescript
// Route configuration
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  loader: async () => {
    const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL;
    const response = await fetch(`${apiUrl}/posts`);
    return response.json();
  },
  component: PostsList,
});
```

## Environment Variable Access Patterns

### Vite-Based Projects (Most Common)

With Vite, environment variables must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be accessible in client code:

```typescript
// Route loaders
export const Route = createFileRoute('/dashboard')({
  loader: async () => {
    const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL        // ✅ Works
    const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_PUBLIC_API_KEY // ✅ Works

    // This would be undefined (security feature):
    // const secret = import.meta.env.SECRET_KEY        // ❌ Undefined

    return fetchDashboardData(apiUrl, apiKey)
  },
})

// Components
export function ApiStatus() {
  const isDev = import.meta.env.DEV           // ✅ Built-in Vite variable
  const isProd = import.meta.env.PROD         // ✅ Built-in Vite variable
  const mode = import.meta.env.MODE           // ✅ development/production

  return (
    <div>
      Environment: {mode}
      {isDev && <DevToolsPanel />}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Webpack-Based Projects

Configure webpack's DefinePlugin to inject environment variables. **Note:** Webpack doesn't support `import.meta.env` by default, so use `process.env` patterns:

```typescript
// webpack.config.js
const webpack = require('webpack')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env.API_URL': JSON.stringify(process.env.API_URL),
      'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV),
      'process.env.ENABLE_FEATURE': JSON.stringify(process.env.ENABLE_FEATURE),
    }),
  ],
}

// Usage in routes
export const Route = createFileRoute('/api-data')({
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch(`${process.env.API_URL}/data`)
    return response.json()
  },
  component: () => {
    const enableFeature = process.env.ENABLE_FEATURE === 'true'
    return enableFeature ? <NewFeature /> : <OldFeature />
  },
})
```

### Rspack-Based Projects

Rspack uses the `PUBLIC_` prefix convention. **Note:** `import.meta.env` support depends on your Rspack configuration and runtime - you may need to configure `builtins.define` properly:

```bash
# .env
PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
PUBLIC_FEATURE_FLAG=true
```

```typescript
// Route usage
export const Route = createFileRoute('/features')({
  loader: async () => {
    const apiUrl = import.meta.env.PUBLIC_API_URL
    return fetch(`${apiUrl}/features`).then(r => r.json())
  },
  component: () => {
    const enableFeature = import.meta.env.PUBLIC_FEATURE_FLAG === 'true'
    return enableFeature ? <NewFeature /> : <OldFeature />
  },
})
```

### ESBuild Projects

Configure defines manually:

```typescript
// build script
import { build } from "esbuild";

await build({
  entryPoints: ["src/main.tsx"],
  define: {
    "process.env.NODE_ENV": '"production"',
    "process.env.API_URL": `"${process.env.API_URL}"`,
  },
});
```

## Common Patterns

### API Configuration in Route Loaders

```typescript
// src/routes/posts/index.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

const fetchPosts = async () => {
  const baseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL
  const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY

  const response = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/posts`, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
  })

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch posts')
  }

  return response.json()
}

export const Route = createFileRoute('/posts/')({
  loader: fetchPosts,
  errorComponent: ({ error }) => (
    <div>Error loading posts: {error.message}</div>
  ),
})
```

### Environment-Based Route Configuration

```typescript
// src/routes/__root.tsx
import { createRootRoute, Outlet } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-router-devtools'

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <Outlet />
      {/* Only show devtools in development */}
      {import.meta.env.DEV && <TanStackRouterDevtools />}
    </>
  ),
})
```

### Feature Flags in Routes

```typescript
// src/lib/features.ts
export const features = {
  enableNewDashboard: import.meta.env.VITE_ENABLE_NEW_DASHBOARD === "true",
  enableAnalytics: import.meta.env.VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS === "true",
  debugMode: import.meta.env.DEV,
};

// src/routes/dashboard/index.tsx
import { createFileRoute, redirect } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { features } from "../../lib/features";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/dashboard/")({
  beforeLoad: () => {
    // Redirect to old dashboard if new one is disabled
    if (!features.enableNewDashboard) {
      throw redirect({ to: "/dashboard/legacy" });
    }
  },
  component: NewDashboard,
});
```

### Authentication Configuration

```typescript
// src/lib/auth.ts
export const authConfig = {
  domain: import.meta.env.VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN,
  clientId: import.meta.env.VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
  redirectUri: `${window.location.origin}/callback`,
};

// src/routes/_authenticated.tsx
import { createFileRoute, redirect } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { authConfig } from "../lib/auth";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/_authenticated")({
  beforeLoad: async ({ location }) => {
    const isAuthenticated = await checkAuthStatus();

    if (!isAuthenticated) {
      // Redirect to auth provider
      const authUrl = `https://${authConfig.domain}/authorize?client_id=${authConfig.clientId}&redirect_uri=${authConfig.redirectUri}`;
      window.location.href = authUrl;
      return;
    }
  },
});
```

### Search Params with Environment Config

```typescript
// src/routes/search.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { z } from "zod";

const searchSchema = z.object({
  q: z.string().optional(),
  category: z.string().optional(),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/search")({
  validateSearch: searchSchema,
  loader: async ({ search }) => {
    const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SEARCH_API_URL;
    const params = new URLSearchParams({
      q: search.q || "",
      category: search.category || "all",
      api_key: import.meta.env.VITE_SEARCH_API_KEY,
    });

    const response = await fetch(`${apiUrl}/search?${params}`);
    return response.json();
  },
});
```

## Environment File Setup

### File Hierarchy (Vite)

Vite loads environment files in this order:

```
.env.local          # Local overrides (add to .gitignore)
.env.production     # Production-specific
.env.development    # Development-specific
.env                # Default (commit to git)
```

### Example Configuration

**.env** (committed to repository):

```bash
# API Configuration
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
VITE_API_VERSION=v1

# Feature Flags
VITE_ENABLE_NEW_UI=false
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true

# Auth Configuration (public keys only)
VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-domain.auth0.com
VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id

# Build Configuration
VITE_APP_NAME=TanStack Router App
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

**.env.local** (add to .gitignore):

```bash
# Development overrides
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
VITE_ENABLE_NEW_UI=true
VITE_DEBUG_MODE=true
```

**.env.production**:

```bash
# Production-specific
VITE_API_URL=https://api.prod.example.com
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
VITE_ENABLE_NEW_UI=true
```

## Type Safety

### Vite TypeScript Declarations

Create `src/vite-env.d.ts`:

```typescript
/// <reference types="vite/client" />

interface ImportMetaEnv {
  // API Configuration
  readonly VITE_API_URL: string;
  readonly VITE_API_VERSION: string;
  readonly VITE_API_KEY?: string;

  // Feature Flags
  readonly VITE_ENABLE_NEW_UI: string;
  readonly VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS: string;
  readonly VITE_DEBUG_MODE?: string;

  // Authentication
  readonly VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN: string;
  readonly VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID: string;

  // App Configuration
  readonly VITE_APP_NAME: string;
  readonly VITE_APP_VERSION: string;
}

interface ImportMeta {
  readonly env: ImportMetaEnv;
}
```

### Runtime Validation

Use Zod to validate environment variables at startup with fallbacks and optional values:

```typescript
// src/config/env.ts
import { z } from "zod";

const envSchema = z.object({
  // Required variables
  VITE_API_URL: z.string().url(),
  VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN: z.string(),
  VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID: z.string(),
  VITE_APP_NAME: z.string(),

  // Optional with defaults
  VITE_API_VERSION: z.string().default("v1"),
  VITE_ENABLE_NEW_UI: z.string().default("false"),
  VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS: z.string().default("true"),

  // Optional variables
  VITE_DEBUG_MODE: z.string().optional(),
  VITE_SENTRY_DSN: z.string().optional(),
});

// Validate at app startup with fallbacks
export const env = envSchema.parse({
  ...import.meta.env,
  // Provide fallbacks for missing optional values
  VITE_API_VERSION: import.meta.env.VITE_API_VERSION || "v1",
  VITE_ENABLE_NEW_UI: import.meta.env.VITE_ENABLE_NEW_UI || "false",
  VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS: import.meta.env.VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS || "true",
});

// Typed helper functions
export const isFeatureEnabled = (flag: keyof typeof env) => {
  return env[flag] === "true";
};

// Type-safe boolean conversion
export const getBooleanEnv = (
  value: string | undefined,
  defaultValue = false,
): boolean => {
  if (value === undefined) return defaultValue;
  return value === "true";
};
```

### Usage with Type Safety

```typescript
// src/routes/api-data.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { env, isFeatureEnabled } from '../config/env'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/api-data')({
  loader: async () => {
    // TypeScript knows these are strings and exist
    const response = await fetch(`${env.VITE_API_URL}/${env.VITE_API_VERSION}/data`)
    return response.json()
  },
  component: () => {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{env.VITE_APP_NAME}</h1>
        {isFeatureEnabled('VITE_ENABLE_NEW_UI') && <NewUIComponent />}
      </div>
    )
  },
})
```

## Bundler-Specific Configuration

### Vite Configuration

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { TanStackRouterVite } from "@tanstack/router-vite-plugin";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    // TanStackRouterVite generates route tree and enables file-based routing
    TanStackRouterVite(),
  ],
  // Environment variables are handled automatically
  // Custom environment variable handling:
  define: {
    // Global constants (these become available as global variables)
    __APP_VERSION__: JSON.stringify(process.env.npm_package_version),
  },
});
```

### Webpack Configuration

```typescript
// webpack.config.js
const { TanStackRouterWebpack } = require("@tanstack/router-webpack-plugin");
const webpack = require("webpack");

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // TanStackRouterWebpack generates route tree and enables file-based routing
    new TanStackRouterWebpack(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      // Inject environment variables (use process.env for Webpack)
      "process.env.API_URL": JSON.stringify(process.env.API_URL),
      "process.env.NODE_ENV": JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV),
      "process.env.ENABLE_FEATURE": JSON.stringify(process.env.ENABLE_FEATURE),
    }),
  ],
};
```

### Rspack Configuration

```typescript
// rspack.config.js
const { TanStackRouterRspack } = require("@tanstack/router-rspack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // TanStackRouterRspack generates route tree and enables file-based routing
    new TanStackRouterRspack(),
  ],
  // Rspack automatically handles PUBLIC_ prefixed variables for import.meta.env
  // Custom handling for additional variables:
  builtins: {
    define: {
      // Define additional variables (these become global replacements)
      "process.env.API_URL": JSON.stringify(process.env.PUBLIC_API_URL),
      __BUILD_TIME__: JSON.stringify(new Date().toISOString()),
    },
  },
};
```

## Production Checklist

- [ ] All client-exposed variables use appropriate prefix (`VITE_`, `PUBLIC_`, etc.)
- [ ] No sensitive data (API secrets, private keys) in environment variables
- [ ] `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Production environment variables are configured on hosting platform
- [ ] Required environment variables are validated at build time
- [ ] TypeScript declarations are up to date
- [ ] Feature flags are properly configured for production
- [ ] API URLs point to production endpoints

## Common Problems

### Environment Variable is Undefined

**Problem**: `import.meta.env.MY_VARIABLE` returns `undefined`

**Solutions**:

1. **Add correct prefix**: Use `VITE_` for Vite, `PUBLIC_` for Rspack.
   Vite's default prefix may be changed in the config:
   ```ts
   // vite.config.ts
   export const config = {
     // ...rest of your config
     envPrefix: "MYPREFIX_", // this means `MYPREFIX_MY_VARIABLE` is the new correct way
   };
   ```
2. **Restart development server** after adding new variables
3. **Check file location**: `.env` file must be in project root
4. **Verify bundler configuration**: Ensure variables are properly injected
5. **Verify variable**:

- **In dev**: is in correct `.env` file or environment
- **For prod**: is in correct `.env` file or current environment **_at bundle time_**. That's right, `VITE_`/`PUBLIC_`-prefixed variables are replaced in a macro-like fashion at bundle time, and will _never_ be read at runtime on your server. This is a common mistake, so make sure this is not your case.

**Example**:

```bash
# ❌ Won't work (no prefix)
API_KEY=abc123

# ✅ Works with Vite
VITE_API_KEY=abc123

# ✅ Works with Rspack
PUBLIC_API_KEY=abc123

# ❌ Won't bundle the variable (assuming it is not set in the environment of the build)
npm run build

# ✅ Works with Vite and will bundle the variable for production
VITE_API_KEY=abc123 npm run build

# ✅ Works with Rspack and will bundle the variable for production
PUBLIC_API_KEY=abc123 npm run build
```

### Runtime Client Environment Variables at Runtime in Production

**Problem**: If `VITE_`/`PUBLIC_` variables are replaced at bundle time only, how to make runtime variables available on the client ?

**Solutions**:

Pass variables from the server down to the client:

1. Add your variable to the correct `env.` file
2. Create an endpoint on your server to read the value from the client

**Example**:

You may use your prefered backend framework/libray, but here it is using Tanstack Start server functions:

```tsx
const getRuntimeVar = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(() => {
  return process.env.MY_RUNTIME_VAR; // notice `process.env` on the server, and no `VITE_`/`PUBLIC_` prefix
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  loader: async () => {
    const foo = await getRuntimeVar();
    return { foo };
  },
  component: RouteComponent,
});

function RouteComponent() {
  const { foo } = Route.useLoaderData();
  // ... use your variable however you want
}
```

### Variable Not Updating

**Problem**: Environment variable changes aren't reflected in app

**Solutions**:

1. **Restart development server** - Required for new variables
2. **Check file hierarchy** - `.env.local` overrides `.env`
3. **Clear browser cache** - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. **Verify correct file** - Make sure you're editing the right `.env` file

### TypeScript Errors

**Problem**: `Property 'VITE_MY_VAR' does not exist on type 'ImportMetaEnv'`

**Solution**: Add declaration to `src/vite-env.d.ts`:

```typescript
interface ImportMetaEnv {
  readonly VITE_MY_VAR: string;
}
```

### Build Errors

**Problem**: Missing environment variables during build

**Solutions**:

1. **Configure CI/CD**: Set variables in build environment
2. **Add validation**: Check required variables at build time
3. **Use .env files**: Ensure production `.env` files exist
4. **Check bundler config**: Verify environment variable injection

### Security Issues

**Problem**: Accidentally exposing sensitive data

**Solutions**:

1. **Never use secrets in client variables** - They're visible in browser
2. **Use server-side proxies** for sensitive API calls
3. **Audit bundle** - Check built files for leaked secrets
4. **Follow naming conventions** - Only prefixed variables are exposed

### Runtime vs Build-time Confusion

**Problem**: Variables not available at runtime

**Solutions**:

1. **Understand static replacement** - Variables are replaced at build time
2. **Use server-side for dynamic values** - Use APIs for runtime configuration
3. **Validate at startup** - Check all required variables exist

### Environment Variables are Always Strings

**Problem**: Unexpected behavior when comparing boolean or numeric values

**Solutions**:

1. **Always compare as strings**: Use `=== 'true'` not `=== true`
2. **Convert explicitly**: Use `parseInt()`, `parseFloat()`, or `Boolean()`
3. **Use helper functions**: Create typed conversion utilities

**Example**:

```typescript
// ❌ Won't work as expected
const isEnabled = import.meta.env.VITE_FEATURE_ENABLED; // This is a string!
if (isEnabled) {
  /* Always true if variable exists */
}

// ✅ Correct string comparison
const isEnabled = import.meta.env.VITE_FEATURE_ENABLED === "true";

// ✅ Safe numeric conversion
const port = parseInt(import.meta.env.VITE_PORT || "3000", 10);

// ✅ Helper function approach
const getBooleanEnv = (value: string | undefined, defaultValue = false) => {
  if (value === undefined) return defaultValue;
  return value.toLowerCase() === "true";
};
```

title: Validate Search Parameters with Schemas
---

Learn how to add robust schema validation to your search parameters using popular validation libraries like Zod, Valibot, and ArkType. This guide covers validation setup, error handling, type safety, and common validation patterns for production applications.

**Prerequisites:** [Set Up Basic Search Parameters](./setup-basic-search-params.md) - Foundation concepts for reading and working with search params.

## Quick Start

Add robust validation with custom error messages, complex types, and production-ready error handling:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute, useRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { zodValidator, fallback } from "@tanstack/zod-adapter";
import { z } from "zod";

const productSearchSchema = z.object({
  query: z.string().min(1, "Search query required"),
  category: z.enum(["electronics", "clothing", "books", "home"]).optional(),
  minPrice: fallback(z.number().min(0, "Price cannot be negative"), 0),
  maxPrice: fallback(z.number().min(0, "Price cannot be negative"), 1000),
  inStock: fallback(z.boolean(), true),
  tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
  dateRange: z
    .object({
      start: z.string().datetime().optional(),
      end: z.string().datetime().optional(),
    })
    .optional(),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/products")({
  validateSearch: zodValidator(productSearchSchema),
  errorComponent: ({ error }) => {
    const router = useRouter();
    return (
      <div className="error">
        <h2>Invalid Search Parameters</h2>
        <p>{error.message}</p>
        <button onClick={() => router.navigate({ to: "/products", search: {} })}>
          Reset Search
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  },
  component: ProductsPage,
});

function ProductsPage() {
  // All search params are validated, type-safe, and have fallback values applied
  const { query, category, minPrice, maxPrice, inStock, tags, dateRange } =
    Route.useSearch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Products</h1>
      <p>Search: {query}</p>
      <p>Category: {category || "All"}</p>
      <p>
        Price Range: ${minPrice} - ${maxPrice}
      </p>
      <p>In Stock Only: {inStock ? "Yes" : "No"}</p>
      {tags && <p>Tags: {tags.join(", ")}</p>}
      {dateRange && (
        <p>
          Date Range: {dateRange.start} to {dateRange.end}
        </p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Validation Library Options

TanStack Router supports multiple validation libraries through adapters:

### Zod (Recommended)

Most popular with excellent TypeScript integration:

```tsx
import { zodValidator, fallback } from "@tanstack/zod-adapter";
import { z } from "zod";

const searchSchema = z.object({
  query: z.string().min(1).max(100),
  page: fallback(z.number().int().positive(), 1),
  sortBy: z.enum(["name", "date", "relevance"]).optional(),
  filters: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/search")({
  validateSearch: zodValidator(searchSchema),
  component: SearchPage,
});
```

### Valibot

Lightweight alternative with modular design:

```tsx
import { valibotValidator } from "@tanstack/valibot-adapter";
import * as v from "valibot";

const searchSchema = v.object({
  query: v.pipe(v.string(), v.minLength(1), v.maxLength(100)),
  page: v.fallback(v.pipe(v.number(), v.integer(), v.minValue(1)), 1),
  sortBy: v.optional(v.picklist(["name", "date", "relevance"])),
  filters: v.optional(v.array(v.string())),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/search")({
  validateSearch: valibotValidator(searchSchema),
  component: SearchPage,
});
```

### ArkType

TypeScript-first with runtime validation:

```tsx
import { type } from "arktype";

const searchSchema = type({
  query: "string>0&<=100",
  page: "number>0 = 1",
  "sortBy?": "'name'|'date'|'relevance'",
  "filters?": "string[]",
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/search")({
  validateSearch: searchSchema,
  component: SearchPage,
});
```

### Custom Validation Function

For complete control, implement your own validation logic:

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/search")({
  validateSearch: (search: Record<string, unknown>) => {
    // Custom validation with detailed error handling
    const result = {
      page: 1,
      query: "",
      category: "all",
    };

    // Validate page number
    const pageNum = Number(search.page);
    if (isNaN(pageNum) || pageNum < 1) {
      throw new Error("Page must be a positive number");
    }
    result.page = pageNum;

    // Validate query string
    if (typeof search.query === "string" && search.query.length > 0) {
      if (search.query.length > 100) {
        throw new Error("Search query too long (max 100 characters)");
      }
      result.query = search.query;
    }

    // Validate category
    const validCategories = ["electronics", "clothing", "books", "all"];
    if (
      typeof search.category === "string" &&
      validCategories.includes(search.category)
    ) {
      result.category = search.category;
    }

    return result;
  },
  component: SearchPage,
});
```

## Common Validation Patterns

### Required vs Optional Parameters

Control which search parameters are mandatory:

```tsx
const validationSchema = z.object({
  // Required - will throw validation error if missing or invalid
  userId: z.number().int().positive(),
  action: z.enum(["view", "edit", "delete"]),

  // Optional - can be undefined
  sortBy: z.string().optional(),

  // Optional with fallback - provides default if missing/invalid
  page: fallback(z.number().int().positive(), 1),
  limit: fallback(z.number().int().min(1).max(100), 20),
});
```

### Complex Data Types

Handle arrays, objects, and custom types:

```tsx
const advancedSchema = z.object({
  // Array of strings
  tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),

  // Array of numbers
  categoryIds: z.array(z.number().int()).optional(),

  // Date validation
  startDate: z.string().datetime().optional(),
  endDate: z.string().datetime().optional(),

  // Custom validation
  email: z.string().email().optional(),

  // Refined validation with custom logic
  priceRange: z
    .object({
      min: z.number().min(0),
      max: z.number().min(0),
    })
    .refine((data) => data.max >= data.min, {
      message: "Max price must be greater than or equal to min price",
    })
    .optional(),
});
```

### Input Transformation

Transform and sanitize input values during validation:

```tsx
const transformSchema = z.object({
  // Transform string to number
  page: z
    .string()
    .transform((val) => parseInt(val, 10))
    .pipe(z.number().int().positive()),

  // Transform and validate email
  email: z.string().toLowerCase().trim().pipe(z.string().email()).optional(),

  // Transform comma-separated string to array
  tags: z
    .string()
    .transform((val) => (val ? val.split(",").map((tag) => tag.trim()) : []))
    .pipe(z.array(z.string().min(1)))
    .optional(),
});
```

## Error Handling Strategies

### Basic Error Handling

Handle validation errors through route error components:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute, useRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { zodValidator } from "@tanstack/zod-adapter";
import { z } from "zod";

const searchSchema = z.object({
  query: z.string().min(1, "Search query is required"),
  page: z.number().int().positive("Page must be a positive number"),
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/search")({
  validateSearch: zodValidator(searchSchema),
  errorComponent: ({ error }) => {
    const router = useRouter();

    return (
      <div className="error">
        <h2>Invalid Search Parameters</h2>
        <p>{error.message}</p>
        <button onClick={() => router.navigate({ to: "/search", search: {} })}>
          Reset Search
        </button>
        <button
          onClick={() =>
            router.navigate({ to: "/search", search: { query: "", page: 1 } })
          }
        >
          Start Over
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  },
  component: SearchPage,
});

function SearchPage() {
  // Only called when validation succeeds
  const search = Route.useSearch();
  // ... rest of component
}
```

### Custom Error Messages

Provide user-friendly validation messages:

```tsx
const userFriendlySchema = z.object({
  query: z
    .string()
    .min(2, "Search query must be at least 2 characters")
    .max(100, "Search query cannot exceed 100 characters"),

  page: fallback(
    z.number().int("Page must be a whole number").positive("Page must be greater than 0"),
    1,
  ),

  category: z
    .enum(["electronics", "clothing", "books"], {
      errorMap: () => ({ message: "Please select a valid category" }),
    })
    .optional(),
});
```

### Validation Error Recovery

Implement fallback behavior for invalid parameters:

```tsx
const resilientSchema = z.object({
  // Use .catch() to provide fallback values on validation failure
  page: z.number().int().positive().catch(1),

  // Use .default() for missing values, .catch() for invalid values
  sortBy: z.enum(["name", "date", "relevance"]).default("relevance").catch("relevance"),

  // Custom recovery logic
  dateRange: z
    .object({
      start: z.string().datetime(),
      end: z.string().datetime(),
    })
    .catch({
      start: new Date().toISOString(),
      end: new Date().toISOString(),
    })
    .optional(),
});
```

## Advanced Validation Techniques

### Conditional Validation

Apply different validation rules based on other parameters:

```tsx
const conditionalSchema = z
  .object({
    searchType: z.enum(["basic", "advanced"]),
    query: z.string().min(1),
  })
  .and(
    z.discriminatedUnion("searchType", [
      z.object({
        searchType: z.literal("basic"),
        // Basic search requires only query
      }),
      z.object({
        searchType: z.literal("advanced"),
        // Advanced search requires additional fields
        category: z.string().min(1),
        minPrice: z.number().min(0),
        maxPrice: z.number().min(0),
      }),
    ]),
  );
```

### Schema Composition

Combine and extend schemas for reusability:

```tsx
// Base pagination schema
const paginationSchema = z.object({
  page: fallback(z.number().int().positive(), 1),
  limit: fallback(z.number().int().min(1).max(100), 20),
});

// Base filter schema
const filterSchema = z.object({
  sortBy: z.enum(["name", "date", "relevance"]).optional(),
  sortOrder: z.enum(["asc", "desc"]).optional(),
});

// Compose schemas for different routes
const productSearchSchema = paginationSchema.extend({
  category: z.string().optional(),
  inStock: fallback(z.boolean(), true),
});

const userSearchSchema = paginationSchema.merge(filterSchema).extend({
  role: z.enum(["admin", "user", "moderator"]).optional(),
  isActive: fallback(z.boolean(), true),
});
```

### Performance Optimization

Optimize validation for better performance:

```tsx
// Pre-compile schemas for better performance
const compiledSchema = zodValidator(
  z.object({
    query: z.string().min(1),
    page: fallback(z.number().int().positive(), 1),
  }),
);

export const Route = createFileRoute("/search")({
  validateSearch: compiledSchema,
  component: SearchPage,
});

// Use selective validation for expensive operations
function SearchPage() {
  // Only validate specific fields when needed
  const search = Route.useSearch({
    select: (search) => ({
      query: search.query,
      page: search.page,
    }),
  });

  return <div>Search Results</div>;
}
```

## Testing Search Parameter Validation

Focus on testing validation behavior specific to your schemas:

```tsx
import { render, screen, waitFor } from "@testing-library/react";
import {
  createRouter,
  createMemoryHistory,
  RouterProvider,
} from "@tanstack/react-router";

describe("Search Validation Behavior", () => {
  it("should show error component when validation fails", async () => {
    const router = createRouter({
      routeTree,
      history: createMemoryHistory({
        initialEntries: ["/search?page=invalid&query="],
      }),
    });

    render(<RouterProvider router={router} />);

    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText("Invalid Search Parameters")).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });

  it("should apply fallback values correctly", async () => {
    const router = createRouter({
      routeTree,
      history: createMemoryHistory({
        initialEntries: ["/search?query=laptops"], // page missing
      }),
    });

    render(<RouterProvider router={router} />);

    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText("Page: 1")).toBeInTheDocument(); // Fallback applied
    });
  });
});
```

**For comprehensive route testing patterns, see:** [Set Up Testing](./setup-testing.md) and [Test File-Based Routing](./test-file-based-routing.md)

## Common Problems

### Problem: Validation errors break the entire route

**Symptoms:** Page fails to load when URL contains invalid search parameters.

**Solution:** Use fallback values and error boundaries:

```tsx
// ❌ Wrong - will throw error and break route
const strictSchema = z.object({
  page: z.number().int().positive(), // No fallback
});

// ✅ Correct - provides fallback for invalid values
const resilientSchema = z.object({
  page: fallback(z.number().int().positive(), 1),
});

// ✅ Alternative - use errorComponent on route
export const Route = createFileRoute("/search")({
  validateSearch: resilientSchema,
  errorComponent: ({ error }) => <SearchError error={error} />,
  component: SearchPage,
});

function SearchPage() {
  // Only called when validation succeeds
  const search = Route.useSearch();
  return <SearchResults search={search} />;
}
```

### Problem: TypeScript errors with optional search parameters

**Symptoms:** TypeScript complains about potentially undefined values.

**Solution:** Use proper optional handling or fallback values:

```tsx
// ❌ Wrong - category might be undefined
function FilterBar() {
  const { category } = Route.useSearch();
  return <span>{category.toUpperCase()}</span>; // TypeScript error
}

// ✅ Correct - handle optional values
function FilterBar() {
  const { category } = Route.useSearch();
  return <span>{category?.toUpperCase() || "All Categories"}</span>;
}

// ✅ Better - use fallback in schema
const schema = z.object({
  category: fallback(z.string(), "all"),
});
```

### Problem: Search parameter arrays not parsing correctly

**Symptoms:** Array values appear as strings instead of arrays.

**Solution:** Ensure proper array parsing in your schema:

```tsx
// ❌ Wrong - doesn't handle URL array format
const badSchema = z.object({
  tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
});

// ✅ Correct - parse comma-separated values or multiple params
const goodSchema = z.object({
  tags: z
    .union([
      z.array(z.string()), // Multiple ?tags=a&tags=b
      z.string().transform((val) => val.split(",")), // Single ?tags=a,b,c
    ])
    .optional(),
});

// ✅ Alternative - custom preprocessing
const preprocessedSchema = z.preprocess((val) => {
  if (typeof val === "string") return val.split(",");
  return val;
}, z.array(z.string()).optional());
```

### Problem: Schema validation is too slow

**Symptoms:** Noticeable delay when navigating with complex search parameters.

**Solution:** Optimize schema complexity and use selective parsing:

```tsx
// ❌ Slow - complex validation on every navigation
const complexSchema = z.object({
  query: z.string().refine(async (val) => await validateQuery(val)),
  // ... many complex validations
});

// ✅ Fast - simplified validation with lazy refinement
const optimizedSchema = z.object({
  query: z.string().min(1), // Basic validation only
  // ... other simple validations
});

// Perform complex validation separately in component
function SearchPage() {
  const search = Route.useSearch();

  // Complex validation only when needed
  const [complexValidation, setComplexValidation] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    validateComplexRules(search).then(setComplexValidation);
  }, [search]);

  return <SearchResults search={search} validation={complexValidation} />;
}
```

title: Code-Based Routing
---

> [!TIP]
> Code-based routing is not recommended for most applications. It is recommended to use [File-Based Routing](../file-based-routing.md) instead.

## ⚠️ Before You Start

- If you're using [File-Based Routing](../file-based-routing.md), **skip this guide**.
- If you still insist on using code-based routing, you must read the [Routing Concepts](../routing-concepts.md) guide first, as it also covers core concepts of the router.

## Route Trees

Code-based routing is no different from file-based routing in that it uses the same route tree concept to organize, match and compose matching routes into a component tree. The only difference is that instead of using the filesystem to organize your routes, you use code.

Let's consider the same route tree from the [Route Trees & Nesting](../route-trees.md#route-trees) guide, and convert it to code-based routing:

Here is the file-based version:

```
routes/
├── __root.tsx
├── index.tsx
├── about.tsx
├── posts/
│   ├── index.tsx
│   ├── $postId.tsx
├── posts.$postId.edit.tsx
├── settings/
│   ├── profile.tsx
│   ├── notifications.tsx
├── _pathlessLayout.tsx
├── _pathlessLayout/
│   ├── route-a.tsx
├── ├── route-b.tsx
├── files/
│   ├── $.tsx
```

And here is a summarized code-based version:

```tsx
import { createRootRoute, createRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const rootRoute = createRootRoute();

const indexRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "/",
});

const aboutRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "about",
});

const postsRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "posts",
});

const postsIndexRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => postsRoute,
  path: "/",
});

const postRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => postsRoute,
  path: "$postId",
});

const postEditorRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "posts/$postId/edit",
});

const settingsRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "settings",
});

const profileRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => settingsRoute,
  path: "profile",
});

const notificationsRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => settingsRoute,
  path: "notifications",
});

const pathlessLayoutRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  id: "pathlessLayout",
});

const pathlessLayoutARoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => pathlessLayoutRoute,
  path: "route-a",
});

const pathlessLayoutBRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => pathlessLayoutRoute,
  path: "route-b",
});

const filesRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "files/$",
});
```

## Anatomy of a Route

All other routes other than the root route are configured using the `createRoute` function:

```tsx
const route = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "/posts",
  component: PostsComponent,
});
```

The `getParentRoute` option is a function that returns the parent route of the route you're creating.

**❓❓❓ "Wait, you're making me pass the parent route for every route I make?"**

Absolutely! The reason for passing the parent route has **everything to do with the magical type safety** of TanStack Router. Without the parent route, TypeScript would have no idea what types to supply your route with!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For every route that **NOT** the **Root Route** or a **Pathless Layout Route**, a `path` option is required. This is the path that will be matched against the URL pathname to determine if the route is a match.

When configuring route `path` option on a route, it ignores leading and trailing slashes (this does not include "index" route paths `/`). You can include them if you want, but they will be normalized internally by TanStack Router. Here is a table of valid paths and what they will be normalized to:

| Path     | Normalized Path |
| -------- | --------------- |
| `/`      | `/`             |
| `/about` | `about`         |
| `about/` | `about`         |
| `about`  | `about`         |
| `$`      | `$`             |
| `/$`     | `$`             |
| `/$/`    | `$`             |

## Manually building the route tree

When building a route tree in code, it's not enough to define the parent route of each route. You must also construct the final route tree by adding each route to its parent route's `children` array. This is because the route tree is not built automatically for you like it is in file-based routing.

```tsx
/* prettier-ignore */
const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([
  indexRoute,
  aboutRoute,
  postsRoute.addChildren([
    postsIndexRoute,
    postRoute,
  ]),
  postEditorRoute,
  settingsRoute.addChildren([
    profileRoute,
    notificationsRoute,
  ]),
  pathlessLayoutRoute.addChildren([
    pathlessLayoutARoute,
    pathlessLayoutBRoute,
  ]),
  filesRoute.addChildren([
    fileRoute,
  ]),
])
/* prettier-ignore-end */
```

But before you can go ahead and build the route tree, you need to understand how the Routing Concepts for Code-Based Routing work.

## Routing Concepts for Code-Based Routing

Believe it or not, file-based routing is really a superset of code-based routing and uses the filesystem and a bit of code-generation abstraction on top of it to generate this structure you see above automatically.

We're going to assume you've read the [Routing Concepts](../routing-concepts.md) guide and are familiar with each of these main concepts:

- The Root Route
- Basic Routes
- Index Routes
- Dynamic Route Segments
- Splat / Catch-All Routes
- Layout Routes
- Pathless Routes
- Non-Nested Routes

Now, let's take a look at how to create each of these route types in code.

## The Root Route

Creating a root route in code-based routing is thankfully the same as doing so in file-based routing. Call the `createRootRoute()` function.

Unlike file-based routing however, you do not need to export the root route if you don't want to. It's certainly not recommended to build an entire route tree and application in a single file (although you can and we do this in the examples to demonstrate routing concepts in brevity).

```tsx
// Standard root route
import { createRootRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const rootRoute = createRootRoute();

// Root route with Context
import { createRootRouteWithContext } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import type { QueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";

export interface MyRouterContext {
  queryClient: QueryClient;
}
const rootRoute = createRootRouteWithContext<MyRouterContext>();
```

To learn more about Context in TanStack Router, see the [Router Context](../../guide/router-context.md) guide.

## Basic Routes

To create a basic route, simply provide a normal `path` string to the `createRoute` function:

```tsx
const aboutRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "about",
});
```

See, it's that simple! The `aboutRoute` will match the URL `/about`.

## Index Routes

Unlike file-based routing, which uses the `index` filename to denote an index route, code-based routing uses a single slash `/` to denote an index route. For example, the `posts.index.tsx` file from our example route tree above would be represented in code-based routing like this:

```tsx
const postsRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "posts",
});

const postsIndexRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => postsRoute,
  // Notice the single slash `/` here
  path: "/",
});
```

So, the `postsIndexRoute` will match the URL `/posts/` (or `/posts`).

## Dynamic Route Segments

Dynamic route segments work exactly the same in code-based routing as they do in file-based routing. Simply prefix a segment of the path with a `$` and it will be captured into the `params` object of the route's `loader` or `component`:

```tsx
const postIdRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => postsRoute,
  path: "$postId",
  // In a loader
  loader: ({ params }) => fetchPost(params.postId),
  // Or in a component
  component: PostComponent,
});

function PostComponent() {
  const { postId } = postIdRoute.useParams();
  return <div>Post ID: {postId}</div>;
}
```

> [!TIP]
> If your component is code-split, you can use the [getRouteApi function](../../guide/code-splitting.md#manually-accessing-route-apis-in-other-files-with-the-getrouteapi-helper) to avoid having to import the `postIdRoute` configuration to get access to the typed `useParams()` hook.

## Splat / Catch-All Routes

As expected, splat/catch-all routes also work the same in code-based routing as they do in file-based routing. Simply prefix a segment of the path with a `$` and it will be captured into the `params` object under the `_splat` key:

```tsx
const filesRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "files",
});

const fileRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => filesRoute,
  path: "$",
});
```

For the URL `/documents/hello-world`, the `params` object will look like this:

```js
{
  '_splat': 'documents/hello-world'
}
```

## Layout Routes

Layout routes are routes that wrap their children in a layout component. In code-based routing, you can create a layout route by simply nesting a route under another route:

```tsx
const postsRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "posts",
  component: PostsLayoutComponent, // The layout component
});

function PostsLayoutComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Posts</h1>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}

const postsIndexRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => postsRoute,
  path: "/",
});

const postsCreateRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => postsRoute,
  path: "create",
});

const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([
  // The postsRoute is the layout route
  // Its children will be nested under the PostsLayoutComponent
  postsRoute.addChildren([postsIndexRoute, postsCreateRoute]),
]);
```

Now, both the `postsIndexRoute` and `postsCreateRoute` will render their contents inside of the `PostsLayoutComponent`:

```tsx
// URL: /posts
<PostsLayoutComponent>
  <PostsIndexComponent />
</PostsLayoutComponent>

// URL: /posts/create
<PostsLayoutComponent>
  <PostsCreateComponent />
</PostsLayoutComponent>
```

## Pathless Layout Routes

In file-based routing a pathless layout route is prefixed with a `_`, but in code-based routing, this is simply a route with an `id` instead of a `path` option. This is because code-based routing does not use the filesystem to organize routes, so there is no need to prefix a route with a `_` to denote that it has no path.

```tsx
const pathlessLayoutRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  id: "pathlessLayout",
  component: PathlessLayoutComponent,
});

function PathlessLayoutComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Pathless Layout</h1>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}

const pathlessLayoutARoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => pathlessLayoutRoute,
  path: "route-a",
});

const pathlessLayoutBRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => pathlessLayoutRoute,
  path: "route-b",
});

const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([
  // The pathless layout route has no path, only an id
  // So its children will be nested under the pathless layout route
  pathlessLayoutRoute.addChildren([pathlessLayoutARoute, pathlessLayoutBRoute]),
]);
```

Now both `/route-a` and `/route-b` will render their contents inside of the `PathlessLayoutComponent`:

```tsx
// URL: /route-a
<PathlessLayoutComponent>
  <RouteAComponent />
</PathlessLayoutComponent>

// URL: /route-b
<PathlessLayoutComponent>
  <RouteBComponent />
</PathlessLayoutComponent>
```

## Non-Nested Routes

Building non-nested routes in code-based routing does not require using a trailing `_` in the path, but does require you to build your route and route tree with the right paths and nesting. Let's consider the route tree where we want the post editor to **not** be nested under the posts route:

- `/posts_/$postId/edit`
- `/posts`
  - `$postId`

To do this we need to build a separate route for the post editor and include the entire path in the `path` option from the root of where we want the route to be nested (in this case, the root):

```tsx
// The posts editor route is nested under the root route
const postEditorRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  // The path includes the entire path we need to match
  path: "posts/$postId/edit",
});

const postsRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "posts",
});

const postRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => postsRoute,
  path: "$postId",
});

const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([
  // The post editor route is nested under the root route
  postEditorRoute,
  postsRoute.addChildren([postRoute]),
]);
```

title: File-Based Routing
---

Most of the TanStack Router documentation is written for file-based routing and is intended to help you understand in more detail how to configure file-based routing and the technical details behind how it works. While file-based routing is the preferred and recommended way to configure TanStack Router, you can also use [code-based routing](../code-based-routing.md) if you prefer.

## What is File-Based Routing?

File-based routing is a way to configure your routes using the filesystem. Instead of defining your route structure via code, you can define your routes using a series of files and directories that represent the route hierarchy of your application. This brings a number of benefits:

- **Simplicity**: File-based routing is visually intuitive and easy to understand for both new and experienced developers.
- **Organization**: Routes are organized in a way that mirrors the URL structure of your application.
- **Scalability**: As your application grows, file-based routing makes it easy to add new routes and maintain existing ones.
- **Code-Splitting**: File-based routing allows TanStack Router to automatically code-split your routes for better performance.
- **Type-Safety**: File-based routing raises the ceiling on type-safety by generating managing type linkages for your routes, which can otherwise be a tedious process via code-based routing.
- **Consistency**: File-based routing enforces a consistent structure for your routes, making it easier to maintain and update your application and move from one project to another.

## `/`s or `.`s?

While directories have long been used to represent route hierarchy, file-based routing introduces an additional concept of using the `.` character in the file-name to denote a route nesting. This allows you to avoid creating directories for few deeply nested routes and continue to use directories for wider route hierarchies. Let's take a look at some examples!

## Directory Routes

Directories can be used to denote route hierarchy, which can be useful for organizing multiple routes into logical groups and also cutting down on the filename length for large groups of deeply nested routes.

See the example below:

| Filename                | Route Path                | Component Output                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| ʦ `__root.tsx`          |                           | `<Root>`                          |
| ʦ `index.tsx`           | `/` (exact)               | `<Root><RootIndex>`               |
| ʦ `about.tsx`           | `/about`                  | `<Root><About>`                   |
| ʦ `posts.tsx`           | `/posts`                  | `<Root><Posts>`                   |
| 📂 `posts`              |                           |                                   |
| ┄ ʦ `index.tsx`         | `/posts` (exact)          | `<Root><Posts><PostsIndex>`       |
| ┄ ʦ `$postId.tsx`       | `/posts/$postId`          | `<Root><Posts><Post>`             |
| 📂 `posts_`             |                           |                                   |
| ┄ 📂 `$postId`          |                           |                                   |
| ┄ ┄ ʦ `edit.tsx`        | `/posts/$postId/edit`     | `<Root><EditPost>`                |
| ʦ `settings.tsx`        | `/settings`               | `<Root><Settings>`                |
| 📂 `settings`           |                           | `<Root><Settings>`                |
| ┄ ʦ `profile.tsx`       | `/settings/profile`       | `<Root><Settings><Profile>`       |
| ┄ ʦ `notifications.tsx` | `/settings/notifications` | `<Root><Settings><Notifications>` |
| ʦ `_pathlessLayout.tsx` |                           | `<Root><PathlessLayout>`          |
| 📂 `_pathlessLayout`    |                           |                                   |
| ┄ ʦ `route-a.tsx`       | `/route-a`                | `<Root><PathlessLayout><RouteA>`  |
| ┄ ʦ `route-b.tsx`       | `/route-b`                | `<Root><PathlessLayout><RouteB>`  |
| 📂 `files`              |                           |                                   |
| ┄ ʦ `$.tsx`             | `/files/$`                | `<Root><Files>`                   |
| 📂 `account`            |                           |                                   |
| ┄ ʦ `route.tsx`         | `/account`                | `<Root><Account>`                 |
| ┄ ʦ `overview.tsx`      | `/account/overview`       | `<Root><Account><Overview>`       |

## Flat Routes

Flat routing gives you the ability to use `.`s to denote route nesting levels.

This can be useful when you have a large number of uniquely deeply nested routes and want to avoid creating directories for each one:

See the example below:

| Filename                        | Route Path                | Component Output                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |

## Mixed Flat and Directory Routes

It's extremely likely that a 100% directory or flat route structure won't be the best fit for your project, which is why TanStack Router allows you to mix both flat and directory routes together to create a route tree that uses the best of both worlds where it makes sense:

See the example below:

| Filename                       | Route Path                | Component Output                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| ʦ `__root.tsx`                 |                           | `<Root>`                          |
| ʦ `index.tsx`                  | `/` (exact)               | `<Root><RootIndex>`               |
| ʦ `about.tsx`                  | `/about`                  | `<Root><About>`                   |
| ʦ `posts.tsx`                  | `/posts`                  | `<Root><Posts>`                   |
| 📂 `posts`                     |                           |                                   |
| ┄ ʦ `index.tsx`                | `/posts` (exact)          | `<Root><Posts><PostsIndex>`       |
| ┄ ʦ `$postId.tsx`              | `/posts/$postId`          | `<Root><Posts><Post>`             |
| ┄ ʦ `$postId.edit.tsx`         | `/posts/$postId/edit`     | `<Root><Posts><Post><EditPost>`   |
| ʦ `settings.tsx`               | `/settings`               | `<Root><Settings>`                |
| ʦ `settings.profile.tsx`       | `/settings/profile`       | `<Root><Settings><Profile>`       |
| ʦ `settings.notifications.tsx` | `/settings/notifications` | `<Root><Settings><Notifications>` |
| ʦ `account.tsx`                | `/account`                | `<Root><Account>`                 |
| ʦ `account.overview.tsx`       | `/account/overview`       | `<Root><Account><Overview>`       |

Both flat and directory routes can be mixed together to create a route tree that uses the best of both worlds where it makes sense.

> [!TIP]
> If you find that the default file-based routing structure doesn't fit your needs, you can always use [Virtual File Routes](../virtual-file-routes.md) to control the source of your routes whilst still getting the awesome performance benefits of file-based routing.

## Getting started with File-Based Routing

To get started with file-based routing, you'll need to configure your project's bundler to use the TanStack Router Plugin or the TanStack Router CLI.

To enable file-based routing, you'll need to be using React with a supported bundler. See if your bundler is listed in the configuration guides below.

[//]: # "SupportedBundlersList"

- [Installation with Vite](../installation-with-vite.md)
- [Installation with Rspack/Rsbuild](../installation-with-rspack.md)
- [Installation with Webpack](../installation-with-webpack.md)
- [Installation with Esbuild](../installation-with-esbuild.md)

[//]: # "SupportedBundlersList"

When using TanStack Router's file-based routing through one of the supported bundlers, our plugin will **automatically generate your route configuration through your bundler's dev and build processes**. It is the easiest way to use TanStack Router's route generation features.

If your bundler is not yet supported, you can reach out to us on Discord or GitHub to let us know. Till then, fear not! You can still use the [`@tanstack/router-cli`](../installation-with-router-cli.md) package to generate your route tree file.

title: File Naming Conventions
---

File-based routing requires that you follow a few simple file naming conventions to ensure that your routes are generated correctly. The concepts these conventions enable are covered in detail in the [Route Trees & Nesting](../route-trees.md) guide.

| Feature                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`__root.tsx`**                   | The root route file must be named `__root.tsx` and must be placed in the root of the configured `routesDirectory`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **`.` Separator**                  | Routes can use the `.` character to denote a nested route. For example, `blog.post` will be generated as a child of `blog`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **`$` Token**                      | Route segments with the `$` token are parameterized and will extract the value from the URL pathname as a route `param`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **`_` Prefix**                     | Route segments with the `_` prefix are considered to be pathless layout routes and will not be used when matching its child routes against the URL pathname.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **`_` Suffix**                     | Route segments with the `_` suffix exclude the route from being nested under any parent routes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **`-` Prefix**                     | Files and folders with the `-` prefix are excluded from the route tree. They will not be added to the `routeTree.gen.ts` file and can be used to colocate logic in route folders.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **`(folder)` folder name pattern** | A folder that matches this pattern is treated as a **route group**, preventing the folder from being included in the route's URL path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **`[x]` Escaping**                 | Square brackets escape special characters in filenames that would otherwise have routing meaning. For example, `script[.]js.tsx` becomes `/script.js` and `api[.]v1.tsx` becomes `/api.v1`.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **`index` Token**                  | Route segments ending with the `index` token (before any file extensions) will match the parent route when the URL pathname matches the parent route exactly. This can be configured via the `indexToken` configuration option, see [options](../../../../api/file-based-routing.md#indextoken).                                                                                   |
| **`.route.tsx` File Type**         | When using directories to organise routes, the `route` suffix can be used to create a route file at the directory's path. For example, `blog.post.route.tsx` or `blog/post/route.tsx` can be used as the route file for the `/blog/post` route. This can be configured via the `routeToken` configuration option, see [options](../../../../api/file-based-routing.md#routetoken). |

> **💡 Remember:** The file-naming conventions for your project could be affected by what [options](../../../../api/file-based-routing.md) are configured.

## Dynamic Path Params

Dynamic path params can be used in both flat and directory routes to create routes that can match a dynamic segment of the URL path. Dynamic path params are denoted by the `$` character in the filename:

| Filename              | Route Path       | Component Output      |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| ...                   | ...              | ...                   |
| ʦ `posts.$postId.tsx` | `/posts/$postId` | `<Root><Posts><Post>` |

We'll learn more about dynamic path params in the [Path Params](../../guide/path-params.md) guide.

## Pathless Routes

Pathless routes wrap child routes with either logic or a component without requiring a URL path. Non-path routes are denoted by the `_` character in the filename:

| Filename       | Route Path | Component Output |
| -------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| ʦ `_app.tsx`   |            |                  |
| ʦ `_app.a.tsx` | /a         | `<Root><App><A>` |
| ʦ `_app.b.tsx` | /b         | `<Root><App><B>` |

To learn more about pathless routes, see the [Routing Concepts - Pathless Routes](../routing-concepts.md#pathless-layout-routes) guide.

[//]: # "BundlerConfiguration"

To use file-based routing with **Esbuild**, you'll need to install the `@tanstack/router-plugin` package.

```sh
npm install -D @tanstack/router-plugin
```

Once installed, you'll need to add the plugin to your configuration.

```tsx
// esbuild.config.js
import { tanstackRouter } from "@tanstack/router-plugin/esbuild";

export default {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    tanstackRouter({
      target: "react",
      autoCodeSplitting: true,
    }),
  ],
};
```

Or, you can clone our [Quickstart Esbuild example](https://github.com/TanStack/router/tree/main/examples/react/quickstart-esbuild-file-based) and get started.

Now that you've added the plugin to your Esbuild configuration, you're all set to start using file-based routing with TanStack Router.

[//]: # "BundlerConfiguration"

## Ignoring the generated route tree file

If your project is configured to use a linter and/or formatter, you may want to ignore the generated route tree file. This file is managed by TanStack Router and therefore shouldn't be changed by your linter or formatter.

Here are some resources to help you ignore the generated route tree file:

- Prettier - [https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html#ignoring-files-prettierignore](https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html#ignoring-files-prettierignore)
- ESLint - [https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/ignore#ignoring-files](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/ignore#ignoring-files)
- Biome - [https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#filesignore](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#filesignore)

> [!WARNING]
> If you are using VSCode, you may experience the route tree file unexpectedly open (with errors) after renaming a route.

You can prevent that from the VSCode settings by marking the file as readonly. Our recommendation is to also exclude it from search results and file watcher with the following settings:

```json
{
  "files.readonlyInclude": {
    "**/routeTree.gen.ts": true
  },
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/routeTree.gen.ts": true
  },
  "search.exclude": {
    "**/routeTree.gen.ts": true
  }
}
```

You can use those settings either at a user level or only for a single workspace by creating the file `.vscode/settings.json` at the root of your project.

## Configuration

When using the TanStack Router Plugin with Esbuild for File-based routing, it comes with some sane defaults that should work for most projects:

```json
{
  "routesDirectory": "./src/routes",
  "generatedRouteTree": "./src/routeTree.gen.ts",
  "routeFileIgnorePrefix": "-",
  "quoteStyle": "single"
}
```

If these defaults work for your project, you don't need to configure anything at all! However, if you need to customize the configuration, you can do so by editing the configuration object passed into the `tanstackRouter` function.

You can find all the available configuration options in the [File-based Routing API Reference](../../../../api/file-based-routing.md).
</file>

<file path="docs/react/routing/installation-with-router-cli.md">
---
title: Installation with Router CLI
---

> [!WARNING]
> You should only use the TanStack Router CLI if you are not using a supported bundler. The CLI only supports the generation of the route tree file and does not provide any other features.

To use file-based routing with the TanStack Router CLI, you'll need to install the `@tanstack/router-cli` package.

```sh
npm install -D @tanstack/router-cli
```

Once installed, you'll need to amend your your scripts in your `package.json` for the CLI to `watch` and `generate` files.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "generate-routes": "tsr generate",
    "watch-routes": "tsr watch",
    "build": "npm run generate-routes && ...",
    "dev": "npm run watch-routes && ..."
  }
}
```

[//]: # "AfterScripts"

You shouldn't forget to _ignore_ the generated route tree file. Head over to the [Ignoring the generated route tree file](#ignoring-the-generated-route-tree-file) section to learn more.

With the CLI installed, the following commands are made available via the `tsr` command

## Using the `generate` command

Generates the routes for a project based on the provided configuration.

```sh
tsr generate
```

## Using the `watch` command

Continuously watches the specified directories and regenerates routes as needed.

**Usage:**

```sh
tsr watch
```

With file-based routing enabled, whenever you start your application in development mode, TanStack Router will watch your configured `routesDirectory` and generate your route tree whenever a file is added, removed, or changed.

## Ignoring the generated route tree file

If your project is configured to use a linter and/or formatter, you may want to ignore the generated route tree file. This file is managed by TanStack Router and therefore shouldn't be changed by your linter or formatter.

## Ignoring the generated route tree file

If your project is configured to use a linter and/or formatter, you may want to ignore the generated route tree file. This file is managed by TanStack Router and therefore shouldn't be changed by your linter or formatter.

Here are some resources to help you ignore the generated route tree file:

- Prettier - [https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html#ignoring-files-prettierignore](https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html#ignoring-files-prettierignore)
- ESLint - [https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/ignore#ignoring-files](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/ignore#ignoring-files)
- Biome - [https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#filesignore](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration/#filesignore)

> [!WARNING]
> If you are using VSCode, you may experience the route tree file unexpectedly open (with errors) after renaming a route.

You can prevent that from the VSCode settings by marking the file as readonly. Our recommendation is to also exclude it from search results and file watcher with the following settings:

```json
{
  "files.readonlyInclude": {
    "**/routeTree.gen.ts": true
  },
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/routeTree.gen.ts": true
  },
  "search.exclude": {
    "**/routeTree.gen.ts": true
  }
}
```

You can use those settings either at a user level or only for a single workspace by creating the file `.vscode/settings.json` at the root of your project.

## Configuration

When using the TanStack Router Plugin with Rspack (or Rsbuild) for File-based routing, it comes with some sane defaults that should work for most projects:

```json
{
  "routesDirectory": "./src/routes",
  "generatedRouteTree": "./src/routeTree.gen.ts",
  "routeFileIgnorePrefix": "-",
  "quoteStyle": "single"
}
```

If these defaults work for your project, you don't need to configure anything at all! However, if you need to customize the configuration, you can do so by editing the configuration object passed into the `tanstackRouter` function.

You can find all the available configuration options in the [File-based Routing API Reference](../../../../api/file-based-routing.md).

<file path="docs/react/routing/route-matching.md">

title: Route Matching
---

Route matching follows a consistent and predictable pattern. This guide will explain how route trees are matched.

When TanStack Router processes your route tree, all of your routes are automatically sorted to match the most specific routes first. This means that regardless of the order your route tree is defined, routes will always be sorted in this order:

- Index Route
- Static Routes (most specific to least specific)
- Dynamic Routes (longest to shortest)
- Splat/Wildcard Routes

Consider the following pseudo route tree:

```
Root
  - blog
    - $postId
    - /
    - new
  - /
  - *
  - about
  - about/us
```

After sorting, this route tree will become:

```
Root
  - /
  - about/us
  - about
  - blog
    - /
    - new
    - $postId
  - *
```

This final order represents the order in which routes will be matched based on specificity.

Using that route tree, let's follow the matching process for a few different URLs:

- `/blog`
  ```
  Root
    ❌ /
    ❌ about/us
    ❌ about
    ⏩ blog
      ✅ /
      - new
      - $postId
    - *
  ```
- `/blog/my-post`
  ```
  Root
    ❌ /
    ❌ about/us
    ❌ about
    ⏩ blog
      ❌ /
      ❌ new
      ✅ $postId
    - *
  ```
- `/`
  ```
  Root
    ✅ /
    - about/us
    - about
    - blog
      - /
      - new
      - $postId
    - *
  ```
- `/not-a-route`
  ```
  Root
    ❌ /
    ❌ about/us
    ❌ about
    ❌ blog
      - /
      - new
      - $postId
    ✅ *
  ```

title: Route Trees

TanStack Router uses a nested route tree to match up the URL with the correct component tree to render.

To build a route tree, TanStack Router supports:

- [File-Based Routing](../file-based-routing.md)
- [Code-Based Routing](../code-based-routing.md)

Both methods support the exact same core features and functionality, but **file-based routing requires less code for the same or better results**. For this reason, **file-based routing is the preferred and recommended way** to configure TanStack Router. Most of the documentation is written from the perspective of file-based routing.

## Route Trees

Nested routing is a powerful concept that allows you to use a URL to render a nested component tree. For example, given the URL of `/blog/posts/123`, you could create a route hierarchy that looks like this:

```tsx
├── blog
│   ├── posts
│   │   ├── $postId
```

And render a component tree that looks like this:

```tsx
<Blog>
  <Posts>
    <Post postId="123" />
  </Posts>
</Blog>
```

Let's take that concept and expand it out to a larger site structure, but with file-names now:

```
/routes
├── __root.tsx
├── index.tsx
├── about.tsx
├── posts/
│   ├── index.tsx
│   ├── $postId.tsx
├── posts.$postId.edit.tsx
├── settings/
│   ├── profile.tsx
│   ├── notifications.tsx
├── _pathlessLayout/
│   ├── route-a.tsx
├── ├── route-b.tsx
├── files/
│   ├── $.tsx
```

The above is a valid route tree configuration that can be used with TanStack Router! There's a lot of power and convention to unpack with file-based routing, so let's break it down a bit.

## Route Tree Configuration

Route trees can be configured using a few different ways:

- [Flat Routes](../file-based-routing.md#flat-routes)
- [Directories](../file-based-routing.md#directory-routes)
- [Mixed Flat Routes and Directories](../file-based-routing.md#mixed-flat-and-directory-routes)
- [Virtual File Routes](../virtual-file-routes.md)
- [Code-Based Routes](../code-based-routing.md)

Please be sure to check out the full documentation links above for each type of route tree, or just proceed to the next section to get started with file-based routing.
</file>

<file path="docs/react/routing/routing-concepts.md">
---
title: Routing Concepts
---

TanStack Router supports a number of powerful routing concepts that allow you to build complex and dynamic routing systems with ease.

Each of these concepts is useful and powerful, and we'll dive into each of them in the following sections.

## Anatomy of a Route

All other routes, other than the [Root Route](#the-root-route), are configured using the `createFileRoute` function, which provides type safety when using file-based routing:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  component: PostsComponent,
});
```

The `createFileRoute` function takes a single argument, the file-route's path as a string.

**❓❓❓ "Wait, you're making me pass the path of the route file to `createFileRoute`?"**

Yes! But don't worry, this path is **automatically written and managed by the router for you via the TanStack Router Bundler Plugin or Router CLI.** So, as you create new routes, move routes around or rename routes, the path will be updated for you automatically.

The reason for this pathname has everything to do with the magical type safety of TanStack Router. Without this pathname, TypeScript would have no idea what file we're in! (We wish TypeScript had a built-in for this, but they don't yet 🤷‍♂️)

## The Root Route

The root route is the top-most route in the entire tree and encapsulates all other routes as children.

- It has no path
- It is **always** matched
- Its `component` is **always** rendered

Even though it doesn't have a path, the root route has access to all of the same functionality as other routes including:

- components
- loaders
- search param validation
- etc.

To create a root route, call the `createRootRoute()` function and export it as the `Route` variable in your route file:

```tsx
// Standard root route
import { createRootRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createRootRoute();

// Root route with Context
import { createRootRouteWithContext } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import type { QueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";

export interface MyRouterContext {
  queryClient: QueryClient;
}
export const Route = createRootRouteWithContext<MyRouterContext>();
```

To learn more about Context in TanStack Router, see the [Router Context](../../guide/router-context.md) guide.

## Basic Routes

Basic routes match a specific path, for example `/about`, `/settings`, `/settings/notifications` are all basic routes, as they match the path exactly.

Let's take a look at an `/about` route:

```tsx
// about.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/about")({
  component: AboutComponent,
});

function AboutComponent() {
  return <div>About</div>;
}
```

Basic routes are simple and straightforward. They match the path exactly and render the provided component.

## Index Routes

Index routes specifically target their parent route when it is **matched exactly and no child route is matched**.

Let's take a look at an index route for a `/posts` URL:

```tsx
// posts.index.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

// Note the trailing slash, which is used to target index routes
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/")({
  component: PostsIndexComponent,
});

function PostsIndexComponent() {
  return <div>Please select a post!</div>;
}
```

This route will be matched when the URL is `/posts` exactly.

## Dynamic Route Segments

Route path segments that start with a `$` followed by a label are dynamic and capture that section of the URL into the `params` object for use in your application. For example, a pathname of `/posts/123` would match the `/posts/$postId` route, and the `params` object would be `{ postId: '123' }`.

These params are then usable in your route's configuration and components! Let's look at a `posts.$postId.tsx` route:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  // In a loader
  loader: ({ params }) => fetchPost(params.postId),
  // Or in a component
  component: PostComponent,
});

function PostComponent() {
  // In a component!
  const { postId } = Route.useParams();
  return <div>Post ID: {postId}</div>;
}
```

> 🧠 Dynamic segments work at **each** segment of the path. For example, you could have a route with the path of `/posts/$postId/$revisionId` and each `$` segment would be captured into the `params` object.

## Splat / Catch-All Routes

A route with a path of only `$` is called a "splat" route because it _always_ captures _any_ remaining section of the URL pathname from the `$` to the end. The captured pathname is then available in the `params` object under the special `_splat` property.

For example, a route targeting the `files/$` path is a splat route. If the URL pathname is `/files/documents/hello-world`, the `params` object would contain `documents/hello-world` under the special `_splat` property:

```js
{
  '_splat': 'documents/hello-world'
}
```

> ⚠️ In v1 of the router, splat routes are also denoted with a `*` instead of a `_splat` key for backwards compatibility. This will be removed in v2.

> 🧠 Why use `$`? Thanks to tools like Remix, we know that despite `*`s being the most common character to represent a wildcard, they do not play nice with filenames or CLI tools, so just like them, we decided to use `$` instead.

## Optional Path Parameters

Optional path parameters allow you to define route segments that may or may not be present in the URL. They use the `{-$paramName}` syntax and provide flexible routing patterns where certain parameters are optional.

```tsx
// posts.{-$category}.tsx - Optional category parameter
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/{-$category}")({
  component: PostsComponent,
});

function PostsComponent() {
  const { category } = Route.useParams();

  return <div>{category ? `Posts in ${category}` : "All Posts"}</div>;
}
```

This route will match both `/posts` (category is `undefined`) and `/posts/tech` (category is `"tech"`).

You can also define multiple optional parameters in a single route:

```tsx
// posts.{-$category}.{-$slug}.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/{-$category}/{-$slug}")({
  component: PostsComponent,
});
```

This route matches `/posts`, `/posts/tech`, and `/posts/tech/hello-world`.

> 🧠 Routes with optional parameters are ranked lower in priority than exact matches, ensuring that more specific routes like `/posts/featured` are matched before `/posts/{-$category}`.

## Layout Routes

Layout routes are used to wrap child routes with additional components and logic. They are useful for:

- Wrapping child routes with a layout component
- Enforcing a `loader` requirement before displaying any child routes
- Validating and providing search params to child routes
- Providing fallbacks for error components or pending elements to child routes
- Providing shared context to all child routes
- And more!

Let's take a look at an example layout route called `app.tsx`:

```
routes/
├── app.tsx
├── app.dashboard.tsx
├── app.settings.tsx
```

In the tree above, `app.tsx` is a layout route that wraps two child routes, `app.dashboard.tsx` and `app.settings.tsx`.

This tree structure is used to wrap the child routes with a layout component:

```tsx
import { Outlet, createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/app")({
  component: AppLayoutComponent,
});

function AppLayoutComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>App Layout</h1>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The following table shows which component(s) will be rendered based on the URL:

| URL Path         | Component                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| `/app`           | `<AppLayout>`            |
| `/app/dashboard` | `<AppLayout><Dashboard>` |
| `/app/settings`  | `<AppLayout><Settings>`  |

Since TanStack Router supports mixed flat and directory routes, you can also express your application's routing using layout routes within directories:

```
routes/
├── app/
│   ├── route.tsx
│   ├── dashboard.tsx
│   ├── settings.tsx
```

In this nested tree, the `app/route.tsx` file is a configuration for the layout route that wraps two child routes, `app/dashboard.tsx` and `app/settings.tsx`.

Layout Routes also let you enforce component and loader logic for Dynamic Route Segments:

```
routes/
├── app/users/
│   ├── $userId/
|   |   ├── route.tsx
|   |   ├── index.tsx
|   |   ├── edit.tsx
```

## Pathless Layout Routes

Like [Layout Routes](#layout-routes), Pathless Layout Routes are used to wrap child routes with additional components and logic. However, pathless layout routes do not require a matching `path` in the URL and are used to wrap child routes with additional components and logic without requiring a matching `path` in the URL.

Pathless Layout Routes are prefixed with an underscore (`_`) to denote that they are "pathless".

> 🧠 The part of the path after the `_` prefix is used as the route's ID and is required because every route must be uniquely identifiable, especially when using TypeScript so as to avoid type errors and accomplish autocomplete effectively.

Let's take a look at an example route called `_pathlessLayout.tsx`:

```

routes/
├── _pathlessLayout.tsx
├── _pathlessLayout.a.tsx
├── _pathlessLayout.b.tsx

```

In the tree above, `_pathlessLayout.tsx` is a pathless layout route that wraps two child routes, `_pathlessLayout.a.tsx` and `_pathlessLayout.b.tsx`.

The `_pathlessLayout.tsx` route is used to wrap the child routes with a Pathless layout component:

```tsx
import { Outlet, createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/_pathlessLayout")({
  component: PathlessLayoutComponent,
});

function PathlessLayoutComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Pathless layout</h1>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The following table shows which component will be rendered based on the URL:

| URL Path | Component             |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| `/`      | `<Index>`             |
| `/a`     | `<PathlessLayout><A>` |
| `/b`     | `<PathlessLayout><B>` |

Since TanStack Router supports mixed flat and directory routes, you can also express your application's routing using pathless layout routes within directories:

```
routes/
├── _pathlessLayout/
│   ├── route.tsx
│   ├── a.tsx
│   ├── b.tsx
```

However, unlike Layout Routes, since Pathless Layout Routes do match based on URL path segments, this means that these routes do not support [Dynamic Route Segments](#dynamic-route-segments) as part of their path and therefore cannot be matched in the URL.

This means that you cannot do this:

```
routes/
├── _$postId/ ❌
│   ├── ...
```

Rather, you'd have to do this:

```
routes/
├── $postId/
├── _postPathlessLayout/ ✅
│   ├── ...
```

## Non-Nested Routes

Non-nested routes can be created by suffixing a parent file route segment with a `_` and are used to **un-nest** a route from its parents and render its own component tree.

Consider the following flat route tree:

```
routes/
├── posts.tsx
├── posts.$postId.tsx
├── posts_.$postId.edit.tsx
```

The following table shows which component will be rendered based on the URL:

| URL Path          | Component                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `/posts`          | `<Posts>`                    |
| `/posts/123`      | `<Posts><Post postId="123">` |
| `/posts/123/edit` | `<PostEditor postId="123">`  |

- The `posts.$postId.tsx` route is nested as normal under the `posts.tsx` route and will render `<Posts><Post>`.
- The `posts_.$postId.edit.tsx` route **does not share** the same `posts` prefix as the other routes and therefore will be treated as if it is a top-level route and will render `<PostEditor>`.

## Excluding Files and Folders from Routes

Files and folders can be excluded from route generation with a `-` prefix attached to the file name. This gives you the ability to colocate logic in the route directories.

Consider the following route tree:

```
routes/
├── posts.tsx
├── -posts-table.tsx // 👈🏼 ignored
├── -components/ // 👈🏼 ignored
│   ├── header.tsx // 👈🏼 ignored
│   ├── footer.tsx // 👈🏼 ignored
│   ├── ...
```

We can import from the excluded files into our posts route

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { PostsTable } from "./-posts-table";
import { PostsHeader } from "./-components/header";
import { PostsFooter } from "./-components/footer";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  loader: () => fetchPosts(),
  component: PostComponent,
});

function PostComponent() {
  const posts = Route.useLoaderData();

  return (
    <div>
      <PostsHeader />
      <PostsTable posts={posts} />
      <PostsFooter />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The excluded files will not be added to `routeTree.gen.ts`.

## Pathless Route Group Directories

Pathless route group directories use `()` as a way to group routes files together regardless of their path. They are purely organizational and do not affect the route tree or component tree in any way.

```
routes/
├── index.tsx
├── (app)/
│   ├── dashboard.tsx
│   ├── settings.tsx
│   ├── users.tsx
├── (auth)/
│   ├── login.tsx
│   ├── register.tsx
```

In the example above, the `app` and `auth` directories are purely organizational and do not affect the route tree or component tree in any way. They are used to group related routes together for easier navigation and organization.

The following table shows which component will be rendered based on the URL:

| URL Path     | Component     |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| `/`          | `<Index>`     |
| `/dashboard` | `<Dashboard>` |
| `/settings`  | `<Settings>`  |
| `/users`     | `<Users>`     |
| `/login`     | `<Login>`     |
| `/register`  | `<Register>`  |

As you can see, the `app` and `auth` directories are purely organizational and do not affect the route tree or component tree in any way.

title: Virtual File Routes
---

> We'd like to thank the Remix team for [pioneering the concept of virtual file routes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjTX8hQTlEc&t=730s). We've taken inspiration from their work and adapted it to work with TanStack Router's existing file-based route-tree generation.

Virtual file routes are a powerful concept that allows you to build a route tree programmatically using code that references real files in your project. This can be useful if:

- You have an existing route organization that you want to keep.
- You want to customize the location of your route files.
- You want to completely override TanStack Router's file-based route generation and build your own convention.

Here's a quick example of using virtual file routes to map a route tree to a set of real files in your project:

```tsx
// routes.ts
import { rootRoute, route, index, layout, physical } from "@tanstack/virtual-file-routes";

export const routes = rootRoute("root.tsx", [
  index("index.tsx"),
  layout("pathlessLayout.tsx", [
    route("/dashboard", "app/dashboard.tsx", [
      index("app/dashboard-index.tsx"),
      route("/invoices", "app/dashboard-invoices.tsx", [
        index("app/invoices-index.tsx"),
        route("$id", "app/invoice-detail.tsx"),
      ]),
    ]),
    physical("/posts", "posts"),
  ]),
]);
```

## Configuration

Virtual file routes can be configured either via:

- The `TanStackRouter` plugin for Vite/Rspack/Webpack
- The `tsr.config.json` file for the TanStack Router CLI

## Configuration via the TanStackRouter Plugin

If you're using the `TanStackRouter` plugin for Vite/Rspack/Webpack, you can configure virtual file routes by passing the path of your routes file to the `virtualRoutesConfig` option when setting up the plugin:

```tsx
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { tanstackRouter } from "@tanstack/router-plugin/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tanstackRouter({
      target: "react",
      virtualRouteConfig: "./routes.ts",
    }),
    react(),
  ],
});
```

Or, you choose to define the virtual routes directly in the configuration:

```tsx
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { tanstackRouter } from "@tanstack/router-plugin/vite";
import { rootRoute } from "@tanstack/virtual-file-routes";

const routes = rootRoute("root.tsx", [
  // ... the rest of your virtual route tree
]);

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tanstackRouter({ virtualRouteConfig: routes }), react()],
});
```

## Creating Virtual File Routes

To create virtual file routes, you'll need to import the `@tanstack/virtual-file-routes` package. This package provides a set of functions that allow you to create virtual routes that reference real files in your project. A few utility functions are exported from the package:

- `rootRoute` - Creates a virtual root route.
- `route` - Creates a virtual route.
- `index` - Creates a virtual index route.
- `layout` - Creates a virtual pathless layout route.
- `physical` - Creates a physical virtual route (more on this later).

## Virtual Root Route

The `rootRoute` function is used to create a virtual root route. It takes a file name and an array of children routes. Here's an example of a virtual root route:

```tsx
// routes.ts
import { rootRoute } from "@tanstack/virtual-file-routes";

export const routes = rootRoute("root.tsx", [
  // ... children routes
]);
```

## Virtual Route

The `route` function is used to create a virtual route. It takes a path, a file name, and an array of children routes. Here's an example of a virtual route:

```tsx
// routes.ts
import { route } from "@tanstack/virtual-file-routes";

export const routes = rootRoute("root.tsx", [
  route("/about", "about.tsx", [
    // ... children routes
  ]),
]);
```

You can also define a virtual route without a file name. This allows to set a common path prefix for its children:

```tsx
// routes.ts
import { route } from "@tanstack/virtual-file-routes";

export const routes = rootRoute("root.tsx", [
  route("/hello", [
    route("/world", "world.tsx"), // full path will be "/hello/world"
    route("/universe", "universe.tsx"), // full path will be "/hello/universe"
  ]),
]);
```

## Virtual Index Route

The `index` function is used to create a virtual index route. It takes a file name. Here's an example of a virtual index route:

```tsx
import { index } from "@tanstack/virtual-file-routes";

const routes = rootRoute("root.tsx", [index("index.tsx")]);
```

## Virtual Pathless Route

The `layout` function is used to create a virtual pathless route. It takes a file name, an array of children routes, and an optional pathless ID. Here's an example of a virtual pathless route:

```tsx
// routes.ts
import { layout } from "@tanstack/virtual-file-routes";

export const routes = rootRoute("root.tsx", [
  layout("pathlessLayout.tsx", [
    // ... children routes
  ]),
]);
```

You can also specify a pathless ID to give the route a unique identifier that is different from the filename:

```tsx
// routes.ts
import { layout } from "@tanstack/virtual-file-routes";

export const routes = rootRoute("root.tsx", [
  layout("my-pathless-layout-id", "pathlessLayout.tsx", [
    // ... children routes
  ]),
]);
```

## Physical Virtual Routes

Physical virtual routes are a way to "mount" a directory of good ol' TanStack Router File Based routing convention under a specific URL path. This can be useful if you are using virtual routes to customize a small portion of your route tree high up in the hierarchy, but want to use the standard file-based routing convention for sub-routes and directories.

Consider the following file structure:

```
/routes
├── root.tsx
├── index.tsx
├── pathlessLayout.tsx
├── app
│   ├── dashboard.tsx
│   ├── dashboard-index.tsx
│   ├── dashboard-invoices.tsx
│   ├── invoices-index.tsx
│   ├── invoice-detail.tsx
└── posts
    ├── index.tsx
    ├── $postId.tsx
    ├── $postId.edit.tsx
    ├── comments/
    │   ├── index.tsx
    │   ├── $commentId.tsx
    └── likes/
        ├── index.tsx
        ├── $likeId.tsx
```

Let's use virtual routes to customize our route tree for everything but `posts`, then use physical virtual routes to mount the `posts` directory under the `/posts` path:

```tsx
// routes.ts
export const routes = rootRoute("root.tsx", [
  // Set up your virtual routes as normal
  index("index.tsx"),
  layout("pathlessLayout.tsx", [
    route("/dashboard", "app/dashboard.tsx", [
      index("app/dashboard-index.tsx"),
      route("/invoices", "app/dashboard-invoices.tsx", [
        index("app/invoices-index.tsx"),
        route("$id", "app/invoice-detail.tsx"),
      ]),
    ]),
    // Mount the `posts` directory under the `/posts` path
    physical("/posts", "posts"),
  ]),
]);
```

## Virtual Routes inside of TanStack Router File Based routing

The previous section showed you how you can use TanStack Router's File Based routing convention inside of a virtual route configuration.
However, the opposite is possible as well.  
You can configure the main part of your app's route tree using TanStack Router's File Based routing convention and opt into virtual route configuration for specific subtrees.

Consider the following file structure:

```
/routes
├── __root.tsx
├── foo
│   ├── bar
│   │   ├── __virtual.ts
│   │   ├── details.tsx
│   │   ├── home.tsx
│   │   └── route.ts
│   └── bar.tsx
└── index.tsx
```

Let's look at the `bar` directory which contains a special file named `__virtual.ts`. This file instructs the generator to switch over to virtual file route configuration for this directory (and its child directories).

`__virtual.ts` configures the virtual routes for that particular subtree of the route tree. It uses the same API as explained above, with the only difference being that no `rootRoute` is defined for that subtree:

```tsx
// routes/foo/bar/__virtual.ts
import { defineVirtualSubtreeConfig, index, route } from "@tanstack/virtual-file-routes";

export default defineVirtualSubtreeConfig([
  index("home.tsx"),
  route("$id", "details.tsx"),
]);
```

The helper function `defineVirtualSubtreeConfig` is closely modeled after vite's `defineConfig` and allows you to define a subtree configuration via a default export. The default export can either be

- a subtree config object
- a function returning a subtree config object
- an async function returning a subtree config object

## Inception

You can mix and match TanStack Router's File Based routing convention and virtual route configuration however you like.  
Let's go deeper!  
Check out the following example that starts off using File Based routing convention, switches over to virtual route configuration for `/posts`, switches back to File Based routing convention for `/posts/lets-go` only to switch over to virtual route configuration again for `/posts/lets-go/deeper`.

```
├── __root.tsx
├── index.tsx
├── posts
│   ├── __virtual.ts
│   ├── details.tsx
│   ├── home.tsx
│   └── lets-go
│       ├── deeper
│       │   ├── __virtual.ts
│       │   └── home.tsx
│       └── index.tsx
└── posts.tsx
```

## Configuration via the TanStack Router CLI

If you're using the TanStack Router CLI, you can configure virtual file routes by defining the path to your routes file in the `tsr.config.json` file:

```json
// tsr.config.json
{
  "virtualRouteConfig": "./routes.ts"
}
```

Or you can define the virtual routes directly in the configuration, while much less common allows you to configure them via the TanStack Router CLI by adding a `virtualRouteConfig` object to your `tsr.config.json` file and defining your virtual routes and passing the resulting JSON that is generated by calling the actual `rootRoute`/`route`/`index`/etc functions from the `@tanstack/virtual-file-routes` package:

```json
// tsr.config.json
{
  "virtualRouteConfig": {
    "type": "root",
    "file": "root.tsx",
    "children": [
      {
        "type": "index",
        "file": "home.tsx"
      },
      {
        "type": "route",
        "file": "posts/posts.tsx",
        "path": "/posts",
        "children": [
          {
            "type": "index",
            "file": "posts/posts-home.tsx"
          },
          {
            "type": "route",
            "file": "posts/posts-detail.tsx",
            "path": "$postId"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "layout",
        "id": "first",
        "file": "layout/first-pathless-layout.tsx",
        "children": [
          {
            "type": "layout",
            "id": "second",
            "file": "layout/second-pathless-layout.tsx",
            "children": [
              {
                "type": "route",
                "file": "a.tsx",
                "path": "/route-a"
              },
              {
                "type": "route",
                "file": "b.tsx",
                "path": "/route-b"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

title: Decisions on Developer Experience
---

When people first start using TanStack Router, they often have a lot of questions that revolve around the following themes:

> Why do I have to do things this way?

> Why is it done this way? and not that way?

> I'm used to doing it this way, why should I change?

And they are all valid questions. For the most part, people are used to using routing libraries that are very similar to each other. They all have a similar API, similar concepts, and similar ways of doing things.

But TanStack Router is different. It's not your average routing library. It's not your average state management library. It's not your average anything.

## TanStack Router's origin story

It's important to remember that TanStack Router's origins stem from [Nozzle.io](https://nozzle.io)'s need for a client-side routing solution that offered a first-in-class _URL Search Parameters_ experience without compromising on the **_type-safety_** that was required to power its complex dashboards.

And so, from TanStack Router's very inception, every facet of its design was meticulously thought out to ensure that its type-safety and developer experience were second to none.

## How does TanStack Router achieve this?

> TypeScript! TypeScript! TypeScript!

Every aspect of TanStack Router is designed to be as type-safe as possible, and this is achieved by leveraging TypeScript's type system to its fullest extent. This involves using some very advanced and complex types, type inference, and other features to ensure that the developer experience is as smooth as possible.

But to achieve this, we had to make some decisions that deviate from the norms in the routing world.

1. [**Route configuration boilerplate?**](#1-why-is-the-routers-configuration-done-this-way): You have to define your routes in a way that allows TypeScript to infer the types of your routes as much as possible.
2. [**TypeScript module declaration for the router?**](#2-declaring-the-router-instance-for-type-inference): You have to pass the `Router` instance to the rest of your application using TypeScript's module declaration.
3. [**Why push for file-based routing over code-based?**](#3-why-is-file-based-routing-the-preferred-way-to-define-routes): We push for file-based routing as the preferred way to define your routes.

> TLDR; All the design decisions in the developer experience of using TanStack Router are made so that you can have a best-in-class type-safety experience without compromising on the control, flexibility, and maintainability of your route configurations.

## 1. Why is the Router's configuration done this way?

When you want to leverage the TypeScript's inference features to its fullest, you'll quickly realize that _Generics_ are your best friend. And so, TanStack Router uses Generics everywhere to ensure that the types of your routes are inferred as much as possible.

This means that you have to define your routes in a way that allows TypeScript to infer the types of your routes as much as possible.

> Can I use JSX to define my routes?

Using JSX for defining your routes is **out of the question**, as TypeScript will not be able to infer the route configuration types of your router.

```tsx
// ⛔️ This is not possible
function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Route path="/posts" component={PostsPage} />
      <Route path="/posts/$postId" component={PostIdPage} />
      {/* ... */}
    </Router>
    // ^? TypeScript cannot infer the routes in this configuration
  );
}
```

And since this would mean that you'd have to manually type the `to` prop of the `<Link>` component and wouldn't catch any errors until runtime, it's not a viable option.

> Maybe I could define my routes as a tree of nested objects?

```tsx
// ⛔️ This file will just keep growing and growing...
const router = createRouter({
  routes: {
    posts: {
      component: PostsPage, // /posts
      children: {
        $postId: {
          component: PostIdPage, // /posts/$postId
        },
      },
    },
    // ...
  },
});
```

At first glance, this seems like a good idea. It's easy to visualize the entire route hierarchy in one go. But this approach has a couple of big downsides that make it not ideal for large applications:

- **It's not very scalable**: As your application grows, the tree will grow and become harder to manage. And since it's all defined in one file, it can become very hard to maintain.
- **It's not great for code-splitting**: You'd have to manually code-split each component and then pass it into the `component` property of the route, further complicating the route configuration with an ever-growing route configuration file.

This only gets worse as you begin to use more features of the router, such as nested context, loaders, search param validation, etc.

> So, what's the best way to define my routes?

What we found to be the best way to define your routes is to abstract the definition of the route configuration outside of the route-tree. Then stitch together your route configurations into a single cohesive route-tree that is then passed into the `createRouter` function.

You can read more about [code-based routing](../routing/code-based-routing.md) to see how to define your routes in this way.

> [!TIP]
> Finding Code-based routing to be a bit too cumbersome? See why [file-based routing](#3-why-is-file-based-routing-the-preferred-way-to-define-routes) is the preferred way to define your routes.

## 2. Declaring the Router instance for type inference

> Why do I have to declare the `Router`?

> This declaration stuff is way too complicated for me...

Once you've constructed your routes into a tree and passed it into your Router instance (using `createRouter`) with all the generics working correctly, you then need to somehow pass this information to the rest of your application.

There were two approaches we considered for this:

1. **Imports**: You could import the `Router` instance from the file where you created it and use it directly in your components.

```tsx
import { router } from "@/src/app";
export const PostsIdLink = () => {
  return (
    <Link<typeof router> to="/posts/$postId" params={{ postId: "123" }}>
      Go to post 123
    </Link>
  );
};
```

A downside to this approach is that you'd have to import the entire `Router` instance into every file where you want to use it. This can lead to increased bundle sizes and can be cumbersome to manage, and only get worse as your application grows and you use more features of the router.

2. **Module declaration**: You can use TypeScript's module declaration to declare the `Router` instance as a module that can be used for type inference anywhere in your application without having to import it.

You'll do this once in your application.

```tsx
// src/app.tsx
declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
  interface Register {
    router: typeof router;
  }
}
```

And then you can benefit from its auto-complete anywhere in your app without having to import it.

```tsx
export const PostsIdLink = () => {
  return (
    <Link
      to="/posts/$postId"
      // ^? TypeScript will auto-complete this for you
      params={{ postId: "123" }} // and this too!
    >
      Go to post 123
    </Link>
  );
};
```

We went with **module declaration**, as it is what we found to be the most scalable and maintainable approach with the least amount of overhead and boilerplate.

## 3. Why is file-based routing the preferred way to define routes?

> Why are the docs pushing for file-based routing?

> I'm used to defining my routes in a single file, why should I change?

Something you'll notice (quite soon) in the TanStack Router documentation is that we push for **file-based routing** as the preferred method for defining your routes. This is because we've found that file-based routing is the most scalable and maintainable way to define your routes.

> [!TIP]
> Before you continue, it's important you have a good understanding of [code-based routing](../routing/code-based-routing.md) and [file-based routing](../routing/file-based-routing.md).

As mentioned in the beginning, TanStack Router was designed for complex applications that require a high degree of type-safety and maintainability. And to achieve this, the configuration of the router has been done in a precise way that allows TypeScript to infer the types of your routes as much as possible.

A key difference in the set-up of a _basic_ application with TanStack Router, is that your route configurations require a function to be provided to `getParentRoute`, that returns the parent route of the current route.

```tsx
import { createRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { postsRoute } from "./postsRoute";

export const postsIndexRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => postsRoute,
  path: "/",
});
```

At this stage, this is done so the definition of `postsIndexRoute` can be aware of its location in the route tree and so that it can correctly infer the types of the `context`, `path params`, `search params` returned by the parent route. Incorrectly defining the `getParentRoute` function means that the properties of the parent route will not be correctly inferred by the child route.

As such, this is a critical part of the route configuration and a point of failure if not done correctly.

But this is only one part of setting up a basic application. TanStack Router requires all the routes (including the root route) to be stitched into a **_route-tree_** so that it may be passed into the `createRouter` function before declaring the `Router` instance on the module for type inference. This is another critical part of the route configuration and a point of failure if not done correctly.

> 🤯 If this route-tree were in its own file for an application with ~40-50 routes, it can easily grow up to 700+ lines.

```tsx
const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([
  postsRoute.addChildren([postsIndexRoute, postsIdRoute]),
]);
```

This complexity only increases as you begin to use more features of the router, such as nested context, loaders, search param validation, etc. As such, it no longer becomes feasible to define your routes in a single file. And so, users end up building their own _semi consistent_ way of defining their routes across multiple files. This can lead to inconsistencies and errors in the route configuration.

Finally, comes the issue of code-splitting. As your application grows, you'll want to code-split your components to reduce the initial bundle size of your application. This can be a bit of a headache to manage when you're defining your routes in a single file or even across multiple files.

```tsx
import { createRoute, lazyRouteComponent } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { postsRoute } from "./postsRoute";

export const postsIndexRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => postsRoute,
  path: "/",
  component: lazyRouteComponent(() => import("../page-components/posts/index")),
});
```

All of this boilerplate, no matter how essential for providing a best-in-class type-inference experience, can be a bit overwhelming and can lead to inconsistencies and errors in the route configuration.

... and this example configuration is just for rendering a single codes-split route. Imagine having to do this for 40-50 routes. Now remember that you still haven't touched the `context`, `loaders`, `search param validation`, and other features of the router 🤕.

> So, why's file-based routing the preferred way?

TanStack Router's file-based routing is designed to solve all of these issues. It allows you to define your routes in a predictable way that is easy to manage and maintain, and is scalable as your application grows.

The file-based routing approach is powered by the TanStack Router Bundler Plugin. It performs 3 essential tasks that solve the pain points in route configuration when using code-based routing:

1. **Route configuration boilerplate**: It generates the boilerplate for your route configurations.
2. **Route tree stitching**: It stitches together your route configurations into a single cohesive route-tree. Also in the background, it correctly updates the route configurations to define the `getParentRoute` function match the routes with their parent routes.
3. **Code-splitting**: It automatically code-splits your route content components and updates the route configurations with the correct component. Additionally, at runtime, it ensures that the correct component is loaded when the route is visited.

Let's take a look at how the route configuration for the previous example would look like with file-based routing.

```tsx
// src/routes/posts/index.ts
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/")({
  component: () => "Posts index component goes here!!!",
});
```

That's it! No need to worry about defining the `getParentRoute` function, stitching together the route-tree, or code-splitting your components. The TanStack Router Bundler Plugin handles all of this for you.

At no point does the TanStack Router Bundler Plugin take away your control over your route configurations. It's designed to be as flexible as possible, allowing you to define your routes in a way that suits your application whilst reducing the boilerplate and complexity of the route configuration.

Check out the guides for [file-based routing](../routing/file-based-routing.md) and [code-splitting](../guide/code-splitting.md) for a more in-depth explanation of how they work in TanStack Router.

title: Devtools
---

> Link, take this sword... I mean Devtools!... to help you on your way!

Wave your hands in the air and shout hooray because TanStack Router comes with dedicated devtools! 🥳

When you begin your TanStack Router journey, you'll want these devtools by your side. They help visualize all of the inner workings of TanStack Router and will likely save you hours of debugging if you find yourself in a pinch!

## Installation

The devtools are a separate package that you need to install:

```sh
npm install @tanstack/react-router-devtools
```

or

```sh
pnpm add @tanstack/react-router-devtools
```

or

```sh
yarn add @tanstack/react-router-devtools
```

or

```sh
bun add @tanstack/react-router-devtools
```

## Import the Devtools

```js
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from "@tanstack/react-router-devtools";
```

## Using Devtools in production

The Devtools, if imported as `TanStackRouterDevtools` will not be shown in production. If you want to have devtools in an environment with `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'`, use instead `TanStackRouterDevtoolsInProd`, which has all the same options:

```tsx
import { TanStackRouterDevtoolsInProd } from "@tanstack/react-router-devtools";
```

## Using inside of the `RouterProvider`

The easiest way for the devtools to work is to render them inside of your root route (or any other route). This will automatically connect the devtools to the router instance.

```tsx
const rootRoute = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
});

const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([
  // ... other routes
]);

const router = createRouter({
  routeTree,
});

function App() {
  return <RouterProvider router={router} />;
}
```

## Manually passing the Router Instance

If rendering the devtools inside of the `RouterProvider` isn't your cup of tea, a `router` prop for the devtools accepts the same `router` instance you pass to the `Router` component. This makes it possible to place the devtools anywhere on the page, not just inside the provider:

```tsx
function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools router={router} />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Floating Mode

Floating Mode will mount the devtools as a fixed, floating element in your app and provide a toggle in the corner of the screen to show and hide the devtools. This toggle state will be stored and remembered in localStorage across reloads.

Place the following code as high in your React app as you can. The closer it is to the root of the page, the better it will work!

```js
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from "@tanstack/react-router-devtools";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Router />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools initialIsOpen={false} />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Devtools Options

- `router: Router`
  - The router instance to connect to.
- `initialIsOpen: Boolean`
  - Set this `true` if you want the devtools to default to being open.
- `panelProps: PropsObject`
  - Use this to add props to the panel. For example, you can add `className`, `style` (merge and override default style), etc.
- `closeButtonProps: PropsObject`
  - Use this to add props to the close button. For example, you can add `className`, `style` (merge and override default style), `onClick` (extend default handler), etc.
- `toggleButtonProps: PropsObject`
  - Use this to add props to the toggle button. For example, you can add `className`, `style` (merge and override default style), `onClick` (extend default handler), etc.
- `position?: "top-left" | "top-right" | "bottom-left" | "bottom-right"`
  - Defaults to `bottom-left`.
  - The position of the TanStack Router logo to open and close the devtools panel.
- `shadowDOMTarget?: ShadowRoot`
  - Specifies a Shadow DOM target for the devtools.
  - By default, devtool styles are applied to the `<head>` tag of the main document (light DOM). When a `shadowDOMTarget` is provided, styles will be applied within this Shadow DOM instead.
- `containerElement?: string | any`
  - Use this to render the devtools inside a different type of container element for ally purposes.
  - Any string which corresponds to a valid intrinsic JSX element is allowed.
  - Defaults to 'footer'.

## Fixed Mode

To control the position of the devtools, import the `TanStackRouterDevtoolsPanel`:

```js
import { TanStackRouterDevtoolsPanel } from "@tanstack/react-router-devtools";
```

It can then be attached to provided shadow DOM target:

```js
<TanStackRouterDevtoolsPanel shadowDOMTarget={shadowContainer} router={router} />
```

Click [here](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/examples/basic-devtools-panel) to see a live example of this in StackBlitz.

## Embedded Mode

Embedded Mode will embed the devtools as a regular component in your application. You can style it however you'd like after that!

```js
import { TanStackRouterDevtoolsPanel } from "@tanstack/react-router-devtools";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Router router={router} />
      <TanStackRouterDevtoolsPanel router={router} style={styles} className={className} />
    </>
  );
}
```

### DevtoolsPanel Options

- `router: Router`
  - The router instance to connect to.
- `style: StyleObject`
  - The standard React style object used to style a component with inline styles.
- `className: string`
  - The standard React className property used to style a component with classes.
- `isOpen?: boolean`
  - A boolean variable indicating whether the panel is open or closed.
- `setIsOpen?: (isOpen: boolean) => void`
  - A function that toggles the open and close state of the panel.
- `handleDragStart?: (e: any) => void`
  - Handles the opening and closing the devtools panel.
- `shadowDOMTarget?: ShadowRoot`
  - Specifies a Shadow DOM target for the devtools.
  - By default, devtool styles are applied to the `<head>` tag of the main document (light DOM). When a `shadowDOMTarget` is provided, styles will be applied within this Shadow DOM instead.

title: Frequently Asked Questions
---

Welcome to the TanStack Router FAQ! Here you'll find answers to common questions about the TanStack Router. If you have a question that isn't answered here, please feel free to ask in the [TanStack Discord](https://tlinz.com/discord).

## Should I commit my `routeTree.gen.ts` file into git?

Yes! Although the route tree file (i.e. `routeTree.gen.ts`) is generated by the TanStack Router, it is essentially towards the runtime of your application. It is not a build artifact. The route tree file is a critical part of your application's source code, and it is used by the TanStack Router to build your application's routes at runtime.

You should commit this file into git so that other developers can use it to build your application.

## Can I conditionally render the Root Route component?

No, the root route is always rendered as it is the entry point of your application.

If you need to conditionally render a route's component, this usually means that the page content needs to be different based on some condition (e.g. user authentication). For this use case, you should use a [Layout Route](../routing/routing-concepts.md#layout-routes) or a [Pathless Layout Route](../routing/routing-concepts.md#pathless-layout-routes) to conditionally render the content.

You can restrict access to these routes using a conditional check in the `beforeLoad` function of the route.

<details>
<summary>What does this look like?</summary>

```tsx
// src/routes/_pathless-layout.tsx
import { createFileRoute, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { isAuthenticated } from "../utils/auth";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/_pathless-layout", {
  beforeLoad: async () => {
    // Check if the user is authenticated
    const authed = await isAuthenticated();
    if (!authed) {
      // Redirect the user to the login page
      return "/login";
    }
  },
  component: PathlessLayoutRouteComponent,
  // ...
});

function PathlessLayoutRouteComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>You are authed</h1>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

title: Migration from React Location
---

Before you begin your journey in migrating from React Location, it's important that you have a good understanding of the [Routing Concepts](../routing/routing-concepts.md) and [Design Decisions](../decisions-on-dx.md) used by TanStack Router.

## Differences between React Location and TanStack Router

React Location and TanStack Router share much of same design decisions concepts, but there are some key differences that you should be aware of.

- React Location uses _generics_ to infer types for routes, while TanStack Router uses _module declaration merging_ to infer types.
- Route configuration in React Location is done using a single array of route definitions, while in TanStack Router, route configuration is done using a tree of route definitions starting with the [root route](../routing/routing-concepts.md#the-root-route).
- [File-based routing](../routing/file-based-routing.md) is the recommended way to define routes in TanStack Router, while React Location only allows you to define routes in a single file using a code-based approach.
  - TanStack Router does support a [code-based approach](../routing/code-based-routing.md) to defining routes, but it is not recommended for most use cases. You can read more about why, over here: [why is file-based routing the preferred way to define routes?](../decisions-on-dx.md#3-why-is-file-based-routing-the-preferred-way-to-define-routes)

## Migration guide

In this guide we'll go over the process of migrating the [React Location Basic example](https://github.com/TanStack/router/tree/react-location/examples/basic) over to TanStack Router using file-based routing, with the end goal of having the same functionality as the original example (styling and other non-routing related code will be omitted).

> [!TIP]
> To use a code-based approach for defining your routes, you can read the [code-based Routing](../routing/code-based-routing.md) guide.

### Step 1: Swap over to TanStack Router's dependencies

First, we need to install the dependencies for TanStack Router. For detailed installation instructions, see our [How to Install TanStack Router](./how-to/install.md) guide.

```sh
npm install @tanstack/react-router @tanstack/router-devtools
```

And remove the React Location dependencies.

```sh
npm uninstall @tanstack/react-location @tanstack/react-location-devtools
```

### Step 2: Use the file-based routing watcher

If your project uses Vite (or one of the supported bundlers), you can use the TanStack Router plugin to watch for changes in your routes files and automatically update the routes configuration.

Installation of the Vite plugin:

```sh
npm install -D @tanstack/router-plugin
```

And add it to your `vite.config.js`:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { tanstackRouter } from "@tanstack/router-plugin/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [tanstackRouter(), react()],
});
```

However, if your application does not use Vite, you use one of our other [supported bundlers](../routing/file-based-routing.md#getting-started-with-file-based-routing), or you can use the `@tanstack/router-cli` package to watch for changes in your routes files and automatically update the routes configuration.

### Step 3: Add the file-based configuration file to your project

Create a `tsr.config.json` file in the root of your project with the following content:

```json
{
  "routesDirectory": "./src/routes",
  "generatedRouteTree": "./src/routeTree.gen.ts"
}
```

You can find the full list of options for the `tsr.config.json` file [here](../../../api/file-based-routing.md).

### Step 4: Create the routes directory

Create a `routes` directory in the `src` directory of your project.

```sh
mkdir src/routes
```

### Step 5: Create the root route file

```tsx
// src/routes/__root.tsx
import { createRootRoute, Outlet, Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from "@tanstack/router-devtools";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => {
    return (
      <>
        <div>
          <Link to="/" activeOptions={{ exact: true }}>
            Home
          </Link>
          <Link to="/posts">Posts</Link>
        </div>
        <hr />
        <Outlet />
        <TanStackRouterDevtools />
      </>
    );
  },
});
```

### Step 6: Create the index route file

```tsx
// src/routes/index.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  component: Index,
});
```

> You will need to move any related components and logic needed for the index route from the `src/index.tsx` file to the `src/routes/index.tsx` file.

### Step 7: Create the posts route file

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.tsx
import { createFileRoute, Link, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  component: Posts,
  loader: async () => {
    const posts = await fetchPosts();
    return {
      posts,
    };
  },
});

function Posts() {
  const { posts } = Route.useLoaderData();
  return (
    <div>
      <nav>
        {posts.map((post) => (
          <Link key={post.id} to={`/posts/$postId`} params={{ postId: post.id }}>
            {post.title}
          </Link>
        ))}
      </nav>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
}
```

> You will need to move any related components and logic needed for the posts route from the `src/index.tsx` file to the `src/routes/posts.tsx` file.

### Step 8: Create the posts index route file

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.index.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/")({
  component: PostsIndex,
});
```

> You will need to move any related components and logic needed for the posts index route from the `src/index.tsx` file to the `src/routes/posts.index.tsx` file.

### Step 9: Create the posts id route file

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.$postId.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  component: PostsId,
  loader: async ({ params: { postId } }) => {
    const post = await fetchPost(postId);
    return {
      post,
    };
  },
});

function PostsId() {
  const { post } = Route.useLoaderData();
  // ...
}
```

> You will need to move any related components and logic needed for the posts id route from the `src/index.tsx` file to the `src/routes/posts.$postId.tsx` file.

### Step 10: Generate the route tree

If you are using one of the supported bundlers, the route tree will be generated automatically when you run the dev script.

If you are not using one of the supported bundlers, you can generate the route tree by running the following command:

```sh
npx tsr generate
```

### Step 11: Update the main entry file to render the Router

Once you've generated the route-tree, you can then update the `src/index.tsx` file to create the router instance and render it.

```tsx
// src/index.tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { createRouter, RouterProvider } from "@tanstack/react-router";

// Import the generated route tree
import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

// Create a new router instance
const router = createRouter({ routeTree });

// Register the router instance for type safety
declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
  interface Register {
    router: typeof router;
  }
}

const domElementId = "root"; // Assuming you have a root element with the id 'root'

// Render the app
const rootElement = document.getElementById(domElementId);
if (!rootElement) {
  throw new Error(`Element with id ${domElementId} not found`);
}

ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </React.StrictMode>,
);
```

### Finished!

You should now have successfully migrated your application from React Location to TanStack Router using file-based routing.

React Location also has a few more features that you might be using in your application. Here are some guides to help you migrate those features:

- [Search params](../guide/search-params.md)
- [Data loading](../guide/data-loading.md)
- [History types](../guide/history-types.md)
- [Wildcard / Splat / Catch-all routes](../routing/routing-concepts.md#splat--catch-all-routes)
- [Authenticated routes](../guide/authenticated-routes.md)

TanStack Router also has a few more features that you might want to explore:

- [Router Context](../guide/router-context.md)
- [Preloading](../guide/preloading.md)
- [Pathless Layout Routes](../routing/routing-concepts.md#pathless-layout-routes)
- [Route masking](../guide/route-masking.md)
- [SSR](../guide/ssr.md)
- ... and more!

title: Migration from React Router Checklist
toc: false
---

**_If your UI is blank, open the console, and you will probably have some errors that read something along the lines of `cannot use 'useNavigate' outside of context` . This means there are React Router api’s that are still imported and referenced that you need to find and remove. The easiest way to make sure you find all React Router imports is to uninstall `react-router-dom` and then you should get typescript errors in your files. Then you will know what to change to a `@tanstack/react-router` import._**

Here is the [example repo](https://github.com/Benanna2019/SickFitsForEveryone/tree/migrate-to-tanstack/router/React-Router)

- [ ] Install Router - `npm i @tanstack/react-router` (see [detailed installation guide](./how-to/install.md))
- [ ] **Optional:** Uninstall React Router to get TypeScript errors on imports.
  - At this point I don’t know if you can do a gradual migration, but it seems likely you could have multiple router providers, not desirable.
  - The api’s between React Router and TanStack Router are very similar and could most likely be handled in a sprint cycle or two if that is your companies way of doing things.
- [ ] Create Routes for each existing React Router route we have
- [ ] Create root route
- [ ] Create router instance
- [ ] Add global module in main.tsx
- [ ] Remove any React Router (`createBrowserRouter` or `BrowserRouter`), `Routes`, and `Route` Components from main.tsx
- [ ] **Optional:** Refactor `render` function for custom setup/providers - The repo referenced above has an example - This was necessary in the case of Supertokens. Supertoken has a specific setup with React Router and a different setup with all other React implementations
- [ ] Set RouterProvider and pass it the router as the prop
- [ ] Replace all instances of React Router `Link` component with `@tanstack/react-router` `Link` component
  - [ ] Add `to` prop with literal path
  - [ ] Add `params` prop, where necessary with params like so `params={{ orderId: order.id }}`
- [ ] Replace all instances of React Router `useNavigate` hook with `@tanstack/react-router` `useNavigate` hook
  - [ ] Set `to` property and `params` property where needed
- [ ] Replace any React Router `Outlet`'s with the `@tanstack/react-router` equivalent
- [ ] If you are using `useSearchParams` hook from React Router, move the search params default value to the validateSearch property on a Route definition.
  - [ ] Instead of using the `useSearchParams` hook, use `@tanstack/react-router` `Link`'s search property to update the search params state
  - [ ] To read search params you can do something like the following
    - `const { page } = useSearch({ from: productPage.fullPath })`
- [ ] If using React Router’s `useParams` hook, update the import to be from `@tanstack/react-router` and set the `from` property to the literal path name where you want to read the params object from
  - So say we have a route with the path name `orders/$orderid`.
  - In the `useParams` hook we would set up our hook like so: `const params = useParams({ from: "/orders/$orderId" })`
  - Then wherever we wanted to access the order id we would get it off of the params object `params.orderId`

To get started quickly, head to the next page. For a more lengthy explanation, buckle up while I bring you up to speed!

## "A Fork in the Route"

Using a router to build applications is widely regarded as a must-have and is usually one of the first choices you’ll make in your tech stack.

[//]: # "WhyChooseTanStackRouter"

**So, why should you choose TanStack Router over another router?**

To answer this question, we need to look at the other options in the space. There are many if you look hard enough, but in my experience, only a couple are worth exploring seriously:

- **Next.js** - Widely regarded as the de facto framework for starting a new React project, it’s laser focused on performance, workflow, and bleeding edge technology. Its APIs and abstractions are powerful, but can sometimes come across as non-standard. Its extremely fast growth and adoption in the industry has resulted in a featured packed experience, but at the expense of feeling overwhelming and sometimes bloated.
- **Remix / React Router** - A full-stack framework based on the historically successful React Router offers a similarly powerful developer and user experience, with APIs and vision based firmly on web standards like Request/Response and a focus on running anywhere JS can run. Many of its APIs and abstractions are wonderfully designed and were inspiration for more than a few TanStack Router APIs. That said, its rigid design, bolted-on type safety and sometimes strict over-adherence to platform APIs can leave some developers wanting more.

Both of these frameworks (and their routers) are great, and I can personally attest that both are very good solutions for building React applications. My experience has also taught me that these solutions could also be much better, especially around the actual routing APIs that are available to developers to make their apps faster, easier, and more enjoyable to work with.

It's probably no surprise at this point that picking a router is so important that it is often tied 1-to-1 with your choice of framework, since most frameworks rely on a specific router.

[//]: # "WhyChooseTanStackRouter"

**Does this mean that TanStack Router is a framework?**

TanStack Router itself is not a "framework" in the traditional sense, since it doesn't address a few other common full-stack concerns. However TanStack Router has been designed to be upgradable to a full-stack framework when used in conjunction with other tools that address bundling, deployments, and server-side-specific functionality. This is why we are currently developing [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start), a full-stack framework that is built on top of TanStack Router and Vite.

For a deeper dive on the history of TanStack Router, feel free to read [TanStack Router's History](../decisions-on-dx.md#tanstack-routers-origin-story).

## Why TanStack Router?

TanStack Router delivers on the same fundamental expectations as other routers that you’ve come to expect:

- Nested routes, layout routes, grouped routes
- File-based Routing
- Parallel data loading
- Prefetching
- URL Path Params
- Error Boundaries and Handling
- SSR
- Route Masking

And it also delivers some new features that raise the bar:

- 100% inferred TypeScript support
- Typesafe navigation
- Built-in SWR Caching for loaders
- Designed for client-side data caches (TanStack Query, SWR, etc.)
- Typesafe JSON-first Search Params state management APIs
- Path and Search Parameter Schema Validation
- Search Parameter Navigation APIs
- Custom Search Param parser/serializer support
- Search param middleware
- Inherited Route Context
- Mixed file-based and code-based routing

Let’s dive into some of the more important ones in more detail!

## 100% Inferred TypeScript Support

Everything these days is written “in Typescript” or at the very least offers type definitions that are veneered over runtime functionality, but too few packages in the ecosystem actually design their APIs with TypeScript in mind. So while I’m pleased that your router is auto-completing your option fields and catching a few property/method typos here and there, there is much more to be had.

- TanStack Router is fully aware of all of your routes and their configuration at any given point in your code. This includes the path, path params, search params, context, and any other configuration you’ve provided. Ultimately this means that you can navigate to any route in your app with 100% type safety and confidence that your link or navigate call will succeed.
- TanStack Router provides lossless type-inference. It uses countless generic type parameters to enforce and propagate any type information you give it throughout the rest of its API and ultimately your app. No other router offers this level of type safety and developer confidence.

What does all of that mean for you?

- Faster feature development with auto-completion and type hints
- Safer and faster refactors
- Confidence that your code will work as expected

## 1st Class Search Parameters

Search parameters are often an afterthought, treated like a black box of strings (or string) that you can parse and update, but not much else. Existing solutions are **not** type-safe either, adding to the caution that is required to deal with them. Even the most "modern" frameworks and routers and leave it up to you to figure out how to manage this state. Sometimes they'll parse the search string into an object for you, or sometimes you're left to do it yourself with `URLSearchParams`.

Let's step back and remember that **search params are the most powerful state manager in your entire application.** They are global, serializable, bookmarkable, and shareable making them the perfect place to store any kind of state that needs to survive a page refresh or a social share.

To live up to that responsibility, search parameters are a first-class citizen in TanStack Router. While still based on standard URLSearchParams, TanStack Router uses a powerful parser/serializer to manage deeper and more complex data structures in your search params, all while keeping them type-safe and easy to work with.

**It's like having `useState` right in the URL!**

Search parameters are:

- Automatically parsed and serialized as JSON
- Validated and typed
- Inherited from parent routes
- Accessible in loaders, components, and hooks
- Easily modified with the useSearch hook, Link, navigate, and router.navigate APIs
- Customizable with a custom search filters and middleware
- Subscribed via fine-grained search param selectors for efficient re-renders

Once you start using TanStack Router's search parameters, you'll wonder how you ever lived without them.

## Built-In Caching and Friendly Data Loading

Data loading is a critical part of any application and while most existing routers offer some form of critical data loading APIs, they often fall short when it comes to caching and data lifecycle management. Existing solutions suffer from a few common problems:

- No caching at all. Data is always fresh, but your users are left waiting for frequently accessed data to load over and over again.
- Overly-aggressive caching. Data is cached for too long, leading to stale data and a poor user experience.
- Blunt invalidation strategies and APIs. Data may be invalidated too often, leading to unnecessary network requests and wasted resources, or you may not have any fine-grained control over when data is invalidated at all.

TanStack Router solves these problems with a two-prong approach to caching and data loading:

### Built-in Cache

TanStack Router provides a light-weight built-in caching layer that works seamlessly with the Router. This caching layer is loosely based on TanStack Query, but with fewer features and a much smaller API surface area. Like TanStack Query, sane but powerful defaults guarantee that your data is cached for reuse, invalidated when necessary, and garbage collected when not in use. It also provides a simple API for invalidating the cache manually when needed.

### Flexible & Powerful Data Lifecycle APIs

TanStack Router is designed with a flexible and powerful data loading API that more easily integrates with existing data fetching libraries like TanStack Query, SWR, Apollo, Relay, or even your own custom data fetching solution. Configurable APIs like `context`, `beforeLoad`, `loaderDeps` and `loader` work in unison to make it easy to define declarative data dependencies, prefetch data, and manage the lifecycle of an external data source with ease.

## Inherited Route Context

TanStack Router's router and route context is a powerful feature that allows you to define context that is specific to a route which is then inherited by all child routes. Even the router and root routes themselves can provide context. Context can be built up both synchronously and asynchronously, and can be used to share data, configuration, or even functions between routes and route configurations. This is especially useful for scenarios like:

- Authentication and Authorization
- Hybrid SSR/CSR data fetching and preloading
- Theming
- Singletons and global utilities
- Curried or partial application across preloading, loading, and rendering stages

Also, what would route context be if it weren't type-safe? TanStack Router's route context is fully type-safe and inferred at zero cost to you.

## File-based and/or Code-Based Routing

TanStack Router supports both file-based and code-based routing at the same time. This flexibility allows you to choose the approach that best fits your project's needs.

TanStack Router's file-based routing approach is uniquely user-facing. Route configuration is generated for you either by the Vite plugin or TanStack Router CLI, leaving the usage of said generated code up to you! This means that you're always in total control of your routes and router, even if you use file-based routing.

## Acknowledgements

TanStack Router builds on concepts and patterns popularized by many other OSS projects, including:

- [TRPC](https://trpc.io/)
- [Remix](https://remix.run)
- [Chicane](https://swan-io.github.io/chicane/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)

We acknowledge the investment, risk and research that went into their development, but are excited to push the bar they have set even higher.

## Let's go!

Enough overview, there's so much more to do with TanStack Router. Hit that next button and let's get started!
</file>

<file path="docs/react/quick-start.md">

title: Quick Start
---

If you're feeling impatient and prefer to skip all of our wonderful documentation, here is the bare minimum to get going with TanStack Router using both file-based route generation and code-based route configuration:

## Using File-Based Route Generation

File based route generation (through Vite, and other supported bundlers) is the recommended way to use TanStack Router as it provides the best experience, performance, and ergonomics for the least amount of effort.

### Scaffolding Your First TanStack Router Project

```sh
npx create-tsrouter-app@latest my-app --template file-router
```

See [create-tsrouter-app](https://github.com/TanStack/create-tsrouter-app/tree/main/cli/create-tsrouter-app) for more options.

### Manual Setup

Alternatively, you can manually setup the project using the following steps:

#### Install TanStack Router, Vite Plugin, and the Router Devtools

```sh
npm install @tanstack/react-router @tanstack/react-router-devtools
npm install -D @tanstack/router-plugin
# or
pnpm add @tanstack/react-router @tanstack/react-router-devtools
pnpm add -D @tanstack/router-plugin
# or
yarn add @tanstack/react-router @tanstack/react-router-devtools
yarn add -D @tanstack/router-plugin
# or
bun add @tanstack/react-router @tanstack/react-router-devtools
bun add -D @tanstack/router-plugin
# or
deno add npm:@tanstack/react-router npm:@tanstack/router-plugin npm:@tanstack/react-router-devtools
```

#### Configure the Vite Plugin

```tsx
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import { tanstackRouter } from "@tanstack/router-plugin/vite";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    // Please make sure that '@tanstack/router-plugin' is passed before '@vitejs/plugin-react'
    tanstackRouter({
      target: "react",
      autoCodeSplitting: true,
    }),
    react(),
    // ...,
  ],
});
```

> [!TIP]
> If you are not using Vite, or any of the supported bundlers, you can check out the [TanStack Router CLI](../routing/installation-with-router-cli.md) guide for more info.

Create the following files:

- `src/routes/__root.tsx` (with two '`_`' characters)
- `src/routes/index.tsx`
- `src/routes/about.tsx`
- `src/main.tsx`

#### `src/routes/__root.tsx`

```tsx
import { createRootRoute, Link, Outlet } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from "@tanstack/react-router-devtools";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <div className="flex gap-2 p-2">
        <Link to="/" className="[&.active]:font-bold">
          Home
        </Link>{" "}
        <Link to="/about" className="[&.active]:font-bold">
          About
        </Link>
      </div>
      <hr />
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
});
```

#### `src/routes/index.tsx`

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  component: Index,
});

function Index() {
  return (
    <div className="p-2">
      <h3>Welcome Home!</h3>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### `src/routes/about.tsx`

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/about")({
  component: About,
});

function About() {
  return <div className="p-2">Hello from About!</div>;
}
```

#### `src/main.tsx`

Regardless of whether you are using the `@tanstack/router-plugin` package and running the `npm run dev`/`npm run build` scripts, or manually running the `tsr watch`/`tsr generate` commands from your package scripts, the route tree file will be generated at `src/routeTree.gen.ts`.

Import the generated route tree and create a new router instance:

```tsx
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { RouterProvider, createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

// Import the generated route tree
import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

// Create a new router instance
const router = createRouter({ routeTree });

// Register the router instance for type safety
declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
  interface Register {
    router: typeof router;
  }
}

// Render the app
const rootElement = document.getElementById("root")!;
if (!rootElement.innerHTML) {
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement);
  root.render(
    <StrictMode>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
    </StrictMode>,
  );
}
```

If you are working with this pattern you should change the `id` of the root `<div>` on your `index.html` file to `<div id='root'></div>`

## Using Code-Based Route Configuration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following example shows how to configure routes using code, and for simplicity's sake is in a single file for this demo. While code-based generation allows you to declare many routes and even the router instance in a single file, we recommend splitting your routes into separate files for better organization and performance as your application grows.

```tsx
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import {
  Outlet,
  RouterProvider,
  Link,
  createRouter,
  createRoute,
  createRootRoute,
} from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from "@tanstack/react-router-devtools";

const rootRoute = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <div className="flex gap-2 p-2">
        <Link to="/" className="[&.active]:font-bold">
          Home
        </Link>{" "}
        <Link to="/about" className="[&.active]:font-bold">
          About
        </Link>
      </div>
      <hr />
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
});

const indexRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "/",
  component: function Index() {
    return (
      <div className="p-2">
        <h3>Welcome Home!</h3>
      </div>
    );
  },
});

const aboutRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "/about",
  component: function About() {
    return <div className="p-2">Hello from About!</div>;
  },
});

const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([indexRoute, aboutRoute]);

const router = createRouter({ routeTree });

declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
  interface Register {
    router: typeof router;
  }
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("app")!;
if (!rootElement.innerHTML) {
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement);
  root.render(
    <StrictMode>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
    </StrictMode>,
  );
}
```

If you glossed over these examples or didn't understand something, we don't blame you, because there's so much more to learn to really take advantage of TanStack Router! Let's move on.

TanStack Form supports arrays as values in a form, including sub-object values inside of an array.

## Basic Usage

To use an array, you can use `field.api.state.value` on an array value:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <ng-container [tanstackField]="form" name="people" #people="field">
      <div>
        @for (_ of people.api.state.value; track $index) {
          <!-- ... -->
        }
      </div>
    </ng-container>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  form = injectForm({
    defaultValues: {
      people: [] as Array<{ name: string; age: number }>,
    },
    onSubmit({ value }) {
      alert(JSON.stringify(value))
    },
  })
}
```

This will generate the mapped JSX every time you run `pushValue` on `field`:

```angular-html
<button (click)="people.api.pushValue(defaultPerson)" type="button">
  Add person
</button>
```

Finally, you can use a subfield like so:

```angular-html
 <ng-container
  [tanstackField]="form"
  [name]="getPeopleName($index)"
  #person="field"
>
  <div>
    <label>
      <div>Name for person {{ $index }}</div>
      <input
        [value]="person.api.state.value"
        (input)="
          person.api.handleChange($any($event).target.value)
        "
      />
    </label>
  </div>
</ng-container>
```

Where `getPeopleName` is a method on the class like so

```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  getPeopleName = (idx: number) => `people[${idx}].name` as const;

  // ...
}
```

> While it's unfortunate that you need to use a function to get the field name, it's a requirement for how our strict TypeScript types work.
>
> See, if we did the following:
>
> ```angular-html
> <ng-container [tanstackField]="form" [name]="'people[' + $index + '].name'"></ng-container>
> ```
>
> We'd be running into a TypeScript issue where `"one" + "two"` is `string` rather than the required `"onetwo"` type
>
> Moreover, while Angular supports template literals in the template, they may not contain dynamic interpolation within them, such as our `$index` argument.

> It's possible that we've missed something! If you can think of a better fix for this problem, [drop us a line on our GitHub discussions](https://github.com/TanStack/form/discussions).

## Full Example

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <form (submit)="handleSubmit($event)">
      <div>
        <ng-container [tanstackField]="form" name="people" #people="field">
          <div>
            @for (_ of people.api.state.value; track $index) {
              <ng-container
                [tanstackField]="form"
                [name]="getPeopleName($index)"
                #person="field"
              >
                <div>
                  <label>
                    <div>Name for person {{ $index }}</div>
                    <input
                      [value]="person.api.state.value"
                      (input)="
                        person.api.handleChange($any($event).target.value)
                      "
                    />
                  </label>
                </div>
              </ng-container>
            }
          </div>
          <button (click)="people.api.pushValue(defaultPerson)" type="button">
            Add person
          </button>
        </ng-container>
      </div>
      <button type="submit" [disabled]="!canSubmit()">
        {{ isSubmitting() ? '...' : 'Submit' }}
      </button>
    </form>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  defaultPerson = { name: '', age: 0 }

  form = injectForm({
    defaultValues: {
      people: [] as Array<{ name: string; age: number }>,
    },
    onSubmit({ value }) {
      alert(JSON.stringify(value))
    },
  })


  getPeopleName = (idx: number) => `people[${idx}].name` as const;

  canSubmit = injectStore(this.form, (state) => state.canSubmit)
  isSubmitting = injectStore(this.form, (state) => state.isSubmitting)

  handleSubmit(event: SubmitEvent) {
    event.preventDefault()
    event.stopPropagation()
    this.form.handleSubmit()
  }
}
```

This page introduces the basic concepts and terminology used in the `@tanstack/angular-form` library. Familiarizing yourself with these concepts will help you better understand and work with the library.

## Form Instance

A Form Instance is an object that represents an individual form and provides methods and properties for working with the form. You create a form instance using the `injectForm` function. The hook accepts an object with an `onSubmit` function, which is called when the form is submitted.

```typescript
const form = injectForm({
  onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
    // Do something with form data
    console.log(value);
  },
});
```

## Field

A Field represents a single form input element, such as a text input or a checkbox. Fields are created using the `tanstackField` directive. The directive accepts a name prop, which should match a key in the form's default values. It also exposes a `field` named instance of the directive's internals that should be used via a template variable to access the field's internals.

Example:

```html
<ng-container [tanstackField]="form" name="firstName" #firstName="field">
  <input
    [value]="firstName.api.state.value"
    (blur)="firstName.api.handleBlur()"
    (input)="firstName.api.handleChange($any($event).target.value)"
  />
</ng-container>
```

## Field State

Each field has its own state, which includes its current value, validation status, error messages, and other metadata. You can access a field's state using the `fieldApi.state` property.

Example:

```ts
const {
  value,
  meta: { errors, isValidating },
} = field.state;
```

There are four states in the metadata that can be useful to see how the user interacts with a field:

- _"isTouched"_, after the user changes the field or blurs the field
- _"isDirty"_, after the field's value has been changed, even if it's been reverted to the default. Opposite of _"isPristine"_
- _"isPristine"_, until the user changes the field value. Opposite of _"isDirty"_
- _"isBlurred"_, after the field has been blurred

```ts
const { isTouched, isDirty, isPristine, isBlurred } = field.state.meta;
```

![Field states](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TanStack/form/main/docs/assets/field-states.png)

## Understanding 'isDirty' in Different Libraries

Non-Persistent `dirty` state

- **Libraries**: React Hook Form (RHF), Formik, Final Form.
- **Behavior**: A field is 'dirty' if its value differs from the default. Reverting to the default value makes it 'clean' again.

Persistent `dirty` state

- **Libraries**: Angular Form, Vue FormKit.
- **Behavior**: A field remains 'dirty' once changed, even if reverted to the default value.

We have chosen the persistent 'dirty' state model. To also support a non-persistent 'dirty' state, we introduce an additional flag:

- _"isDefaultValue"_, whether the field's current value is the default value

```ts
const { isDefaultValue, isTouched } = field.state.meta;

// The following line will re-create the non-Persistent `dirty` functionality.
const nonPersistentIsDirty = !isDefaultValue;
```

![Field states extended](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TanStack/form/main/docs/assets/field-states-extended.png)

## Field API

The Field API is an object accessed in the `tanstackField.api` property when creating a field. It provides methods for working with the field's state.

Example:

```angular-html
<input
  [value]="fieldName.api.state.value"
  (blur)="fieldName.api.handleBlur()"
  (input)="fieldName.api.handleChange($any($event).target.value)"
/>
```

## Validation

`@tanstack/angular-form` provides both synchronous and asynchronous validation out of the box. Validation functions can be passed to the `tanstackField` directive using the `validators` prop.

Example:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <ng-container [tanstackField]="form" name="firstName" #firstName="field">
      <input
        [value]="firstName.api.state.value"
        (blur)="firstName.api.handleBlur()"
        (input)="firstName.api.handleChange($any($event).target.value)"
      />
    </ng-container>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  firstNameValidator: FieldValidateFn<any, any, string, any> = ({
                                                                       value,
                                                                     }) =>
    !value
      ? 'A first name is required'
      : value.length < 3
        ? 'First name must be at least 3 characters'
        : undefined

  firstNameAsyncValidator: FieldValidateAsyncFn<any, string, any> =
    async ({ value }) => {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
      return value.includes('error') && 'No "error" allowed in first name'
    }

  form = injectForm({
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: '',
    },
    onSubmit({ value }) {
      console.log(value)
    },
  })
}
```

## Validation with Standard Schema Libraries

In addition to hand-rolled validation options, we also support the [Standard Schema](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema) specification.

You can define a schema using any of the libraries implementing the specification and pass it to a form or field validator.

Supported libraries include:

- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) (v3.24.0 or higher)
- [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/) (v1.0.0 or higher)
- [ArkType](https://arktype.io/) (v2.1.20 or higher)
- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) (v1.7.0 or higher)

Example:

```angular-ts
import { z } from 'zod'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <ng-container
      [tanstackField]="form"
      name="firstName"
      [validators]="{
        onChange: z.string().min(3, 'First name must be at least 3 characters'),
        onChangeAsyncDebounceMs: 500,
        onChangeAsync: firstNameAsyncValidator
      }"
      #firstName="field"
    >
      <!-- ... -->
    </ng-container>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  firstNameAsyncValidator = z.string().refine(
    async (value) => {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
      return !value.includes('error')
    },
    {
      message: "No 'error' allowed in first name",
    },
  )

  form = injectForm({
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: '',
    },
    onSubmit({ value }) {
      // Do something with form data
      console.log(value)
    },
  })

  z = z
}
```

## Reactivity

`@tanstack/angular-form` offers a way to subscribe to form and field state changes via `injectStore(this.form, selector)`.

Example:

```typescript
import { injectForm, injectStore } from "@tanstack/angular-form";

@Component(/*...*/)
class AppComponent {
  form = injectForm(/*...*/);
  canSubmit = injectStore(this.form, (state) => state.canSubmit);
  isSubmitting = injectStore(this.form, (state) => state.isSubmitting);
}
```

## Listeners

`@tanstack/angular-form` allows you to react to specific triggers and "listen" to them to dispatch side effects.

Example:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <ng-container
      [tanstackField]="form"
      name="country"
      [listeners]="{
        onChange: onCountryChange
      }"
      #country="field"
    ></ng-container>
  `,
})

...

onCountryChange: FieldListenerFn<any, any, any, any, string> = ({
    value,
  }) => {
    console.log(`Country changed to: ${value}, resetting province`)
    this.form.setFieldValue('province', '')
  }
```

More information can be found at [Listeners](../listeners.md)

## Array Fields

Array fields allow you to manage a list of values within a form, such as a list of hobbies. You can create an array field using the `tanstackField` directive.

When working with array fields, you can use the fields `pushValue`, `removeValue`, and `swapValues` methods to add, remove, and swap values in the array.

Example:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <ng-container [tanstackField]="form" name="hobbies" #hobbies="field">
      <div>
        Hobbies
        <div>
          @if (!hobbies.api.state.value.length) {
            No hobbies found
          }
          @for (_ of hobbies.api.state.value; track $index) {
            <div>
              <ng-container
                [tanstackField]="form"
                [name]="getHobbyName($index)"
                #hobbyName="field"
              >
                <div>
                  <label [for]="hobbyName.api.name">Name:</label>
                  <input
                    [id]="hobbyName.api.name"
                    [name]="hobbyName.api.name"
                    [value]="hobbyName.api.state.value"
                    (blur)="hobbyName.api.handleBlur()"
                    (input)="
                      hobbyName.api.handleChange($any($event).target.value)
                    "
                  />
                  <button
                    type="button"
                    (click)="hobbies.api.removeValue($index)"
                  >
                    X
                  </button>
                </div>
              </ng-container>
              <ng-container
                [tanstackField]="form"
                [name]="getHobbyDesc($index)"
                #hobbyDesc="field"
              >
                <div>
                  <label [for]="hobbyDesc.api.name">Description:</label>
                  <input
                    [id]="hobbyDesc.api.name"
                    [name]="hobbyDesc.api.name"
                    [value]="hobbyDesc.api.state.value"
                    (blur)="hobbyDesc.api.handleBlur()"
                    (input)="
                      hobbyDesc.api.handleChange($any($event).target.value)
                    "
                  />
                </div>
              </ng-container>
            </div>
          }
        </div>
        <button type="button" (click)="hobbies.api.pushValue(defaultHobby)">
          Add hobby
        </button>
      </div>
    </ng-container>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  defaultHobby = {
    name: '',
    description: '',
    yearsOfExperience: 0,
  }

  getHobbyName = (idx: number) => `hobbies[${idx}].name` as const;
  getHobbyDesc = (idx: number) => `hobbies[${idx}].description` as const;

  form = injectForm({
    defaultValues: {
      hobbies: [] as Array<{
        name: string
        description: string
        yearsOfExperience: number
      }>,
    },
    onSubmit({ value }) {
      alert(JSON.stringify(value))
    },
  })
}
```

These are the basic concepts and terminology used in the `@tanstack/angular-form` library. Understanding these concepts will help you work more effectively with the library and create complex forms with ease.

title: Form Composition
---

A common criticism of TanStack Form is its verbosity out-of-the-box. While this _can_ be useful for educational purposes - helping enforce understanding our APIs - it's not ideal in production use cases.

As a result, while basic usage of `[tanstackField]` enables the most powerful and flexible usage of TanStack Form, we provide APIs that wrap it and make your application code less verbose.

## Pre-bound Field Components

If you've ever used TanStack Form in Angular to bind more than one input, you'll have quickly realized how much goes into each input:

```angular-ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core'
import { TanStackField, injectForm, injectStore } from '@tanstack/angular-form'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <div>
      <ng-container
        [tanstackField]="form"
        name="firstName"
        #firstName="field"
      >
        <label [for]="firstName.api.name">First Name:</label>
        <input
          [id]="firstName.api.name"
          [name]="firstName.api.name"
          [value]="firstName.api.state.value"
          (blur)="firstName.api.handleBlur()"
          (input)="firstName.api.handleChange($any($event).target.value)"
        />
        @if (firstName.api.state.meta.isTouched) {
          @for (error of firstName.api.state.meta.errors; track $index) {
            <div style="color: red">
              {{ error }}
            </div>
          }
        }
        @if (firstName.api.state.meta.isValidating) {
          <p>Validating...</p>
        }
      </ng-container>
    </div>
    <div>
      <ng-container
        [tanstackField]="form"
        name="lastName"
        #lastName="field"
      >
        <label [for]="lastName.api.name">Last Name:</label>
        <input
          [id]="lastName.api.name"
          [name]="lastName.api.name"
          [value]="lastName.api.state.value"
          (blur)="lastName.api.handleBlur()"
          (input)="lastName.api.handleChange($any($event).target.value)"
        />
        @if (lastName.api.state.meta.isTouched) {
          @for (error of lastName.api.state.meta.errors; track $index) {
            <div style="color: red">
              {{ error }}
            </div>
          }
        }
        @if (lastName.api.state.meta.isValidating) {
          <p>Validating...</p>
        }
      </ng-container>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  form = injectForm({
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: '',
      lastName: '',
    },
    onSubmit({ value }) {
      // Do something with form data
      console.log(value)
    },
  })
}
```

This is functionally correct, but introduces a _lot_ of repeated templating behavior over and over. Instead, let's move the error handling, label to input binding, and other repeated logic into a component:

```angular-ts
import {injectField} from '@tanstack/angular-form'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-text-field',
  standalone: true,
  template: `
    <label [for]="field.api.name">{{ label() }}</label>
    <input
      [id]="field.api.name"
      [name]="field.api.name"
      [value]="field.api.state.value"
      (blur)="field.api.handleBlur()"
      (input)="field.api.handleChange($any($event).target.value)"
    />
    @if (field.api.state.meta.isTouched) {
      @for (error of field.api.state.meta.errors; track $index) {
        <div style="color: red">
          {{ error }}
        </div>
      }
    }
    @if (field.api.state.meta.isValidating) {
      <p>Validating...</p>
    }
  `,
})
export class AppTextField {
  label = input.required<string>()
  // This API requires another part to it from the parent component
  field = injectField<string>()
}
```

> `injectField` accepts a single generic to define the `field.state.value` type.
>
> As a result, a numerical text field would be represented as `injectField<number>`, for example.

Now, we can use the `TanStackAppField` directive (`tanstack-app-field`) to `provide` the expected field associated with this input:

```angular-ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core'
import {
  TanStackAppField,
  TanStackField,
  injectForm,
} from '@tanstack/angular-form'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField, TanStackAppField, AppTextField],
  template: `
    <div>
      <app-text-field
        label="First name:"
        tanstack-app-field
        [tanstackField]="form"
        name="firstName"
      />
    </div>
    <div>
      <app-text-field
        label="Last name:"
        tanstack-app-field
        [tanstackField]="form"
        name="lastName"
      />
    </div>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  form = injectForm({
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: '',
      lastName: '',
    },
    onSubmit({ value }) {
      // Do something with form data
      console.log(value)
    },
  })
}
```

> Here, the `tanstack-app-field` directive is taking the properties from `[tanstackField]` and `provide`ing them down to the `app-text-field` so that they can be more easily consumed as a component.

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/angular/guides/listeners.md">
---
id: listeners
title: Side effects for event triggers
---

For situations where you want to "affect" or "react" to triggers, there's the listener API. For example, if you, as the developer, want to reset a form field as a result of another field changing, you would use the listener API.

Imagine the following user flow:

- User selects a country from a drop-down.
- User then selects a province from another drop-down.
- User changes the selected country to a different one.

In this example, when the user changes the country, the selected province needs to be reset as it's no longer valid. With the listener API, we can subscribe to the onChange event and dispatch a reset to the field "province" when the listener is fired.

Events that can be "listened" to are:

- onChange
- onBlur
- onMount
- onSubmit

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <ng-container
      [tanstackField]="form"
      name="country"
      [listeners]="{
        onChange: onCountryChange
      }"
      #country="field"
    ></ng-container>

    <ng-container
      [tanstackField]="form"
      name="province"
      #province="field"
    ></ng-container>
  `,
})

export class AppComponent {
  form = injectForm({
    defaultValues: {
      country: '',
      province: '',
    },
  })

  onCountryChange: FieldListenerFn<any, any, any, any, string> = ({
    value,
  }) => {
    console.log(`Country changed to: ${value}, resetting province`)
    this.form.setFieldValue('province', '')
  }
}
```
</file>

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/angular/guides/submission-handling.md">
---
id: submission-handling
title: Submission handling
---

## Passing additional data to submission handling

You may have multiple types of submission behaviour, for example, going back to another page or staying on the form.
You can accomplish this by specifying the `onSubmitMeta` property. This meta data will be passed to the `onSubmit` function.

> Note: if `form.handleSubmit()` is called without metadata, it will use the provided default.

```angular-ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { injectForm } from '@tanstack/angular-form';


type FormMeta = {
  submitAction: 'continue' | 'backToMenu' | null;
};

// Metadata is not required to call form.handleSubmit().
// Specify what values to use as default if no meta is passed
const defaultMeta: FormMeta = {
  submitAction: null,
};

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <form (submit)="handleSubmit($event)">
      <button type="submit" (click)="
        handleClick({ submitAction: 'continue' })
      ">Submit and continue</button>
      <button type="submit" (click)="
        handleClick({ submitAction: 'backToMenu' })
      ">Submit and back to menu</button>
    </form>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  form = injectForm({
    defaultValues: {
      data: '',
    },
    // Define what meta values to expect on submission
    onSubmitMeta: defaultMeta,
    onSubmit: async ({ value, meta }) => {
      // Do something with the values passed via handleSubmit
      console.log(`Selected action - ${meta.submitAction}`, value);
    },
  });

  handleSubmit(event: SubmitEvent) {
    event.preventDefault();
    event.stopPropagation();
  }

  handleClick(meta: FormMeta) {
    // Overwrites the default specified in onSubmitMeta
    this.form.handleSubmit(meta);
  }
}
```

## Transforming data with Standard Schemas

While Tanstack Form provides [Standard Schema support](../validation.md) for validation, it does not preserve the Schema's output data.

The value passed to the `onSubmit` function will always be the input data. To receive the output data of a Standard Schema, parse it in the `onSubmit` function:

```tsx
import { z } from "zod";
// ...

const schema = z.object({
  age: z.string().transform((age) => Number(age)),
});

// Tanstack Form uses the input type of Standard Schemas
const defaultValues: z.input<typeof schema> = {
  age: "13",
};

// ...

@Component({
  // ...
})
export class AppComponent {
  form = injectForm({
    defaultValues,
    validators: {
      onChange: schema,
    },
    onSubmit: ({ value }) => {
      const inputAge: string = value.age;
      // Pass it through the schema to get the transformed value
      const result = schema.parse(value);
      const outputAge: number = result.age;
    },
  });
}
```

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/angular/guides/validation.md">

id: form-validation
title: Form and Field Validation
---

At the core of TanStack Form's functionalities is the concept of validation. TanStack Form makes validation highly customizable:

- You can control when to perform the validation (on change, on input, on blur, on submit...)
- Validation rules can be defined at the field level or at the form level
- Validation can be synchronous or asynchronous (for example, as a result of an API call)

## When is validation performed?

It's up to you! The `[tanstackField]` directive accepts some callbacks as props such as `onChange` or `onBlur`. Those callbacks are passed the current value of the field, as well as the fieldAPI object, so that you can perform the validation. If you find a validation error, simply return the error message as string and it will be available in `field.api.state.meta.errors`.

Here is an example:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <ng-container
      [tanstackField]="form"
      name="age"
      [validators]="{
        onChange: ageValidator
      }"
      #age="field"
    >
      <label [for]="age.api.name">Age:</label>
      <input
        [id]="age.api.name"
        [name]="age.api.name"
        [value]="age.api.state.value"
        type="number"
        (input)="age.api.handleChange($any($event).target.valueAsNumber)"
      />
      @if (age.api.state.meta.errors) {
        <em role="alert">{{ age.api.state.meta.errors.join(', ') }}</em>
      }
    </ng-container>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  ageValidator: FieldValidateFn<any, any, any, any, number> = ({ value }) =>
    value < 13 ? 'You must be 13 to make an account' : undefined

  // ...
}
```

In the example above, the validation is done at each keystroke (`onChange`). If, instead, we wanted the validation to be done when the field is blurred, we would change the code above like so:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <ng-container
      [tanstackField]="form"
      name="age"
      [validators]="{
        onBlur: ageValidator
      }"
      #age="field"
    >
      <label [for]="age.api.name">Age:</label>
      <!-- We always need to implement onChange, so that TanStack Form receives the changes -->
      <!-- Listen to the onBlur event on the field -->
      <input
        [id]="age.api.name"
        [name]="age.api.name"
        [value]="age.api.state.value"
        type="number"
        (blur)='age.api.handleBlur()'
        (input)="age.api.handleChange($any($event).target.valueAsNumber)"
      />
      @if (age.api.state.meta.errors) {
        <em role="alert">{{ age.api.state.meta.errors.join(', ') }}</em>
      }
    </ng-container>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  ageValidator: FieldValidateFn<any, any, any, any, number> = ({ value }) =>
    value < 13 ? 'You must be 13 to make an account' : undefined

  // ...
}
```

So you can control when the validation is done by implementing the desired callback. You can even perform different pieces of validation at different times:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <ng-container
      [tanstackField]="form"
      name="age"
      [validators]="{
        onChange: ageValidator,
        onBlur: minimumAgeValidator
      }"
      #age="field"
    >
      <label [for]="age.api.name">Age:</label>
      <!-- We always need to implement onChange, so that TanStack Form receives the changes -->
      <!-- Listen to the onBlur event on the field -->
      <input
        [id]="age.api.name"
        [name]="age.api.name"
        [value]="age.api.state.value"
        type="number"
        (blur)="age.api.handleBlur()"
        (input)="age.api.handleChange($any($event).target.valueAsNumber)"
      />
      @if (!age.api.state.meta.isValid) {
        <em role="alert">{{ age.api.state.meta.errors.join(', ') }}</em>
      }
    </ng-container>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  ageValidator: FieldValidateFn<any, any, any, any, number> = ({ value }) =>
    value < 13 ? 'You must be 13 to make an account' : undefined

  minimumAgeValidator: FieldValidateFn<any, any, any, any, number> = ({
    value,
  }) => (value < 0 ? 'Invalid value' : undefined)

  // ...
}
```

In the example above, we are validating different things on the same field at different times (at each keystroke and when blurring the field). Since `field.state.meta.errors` is an array, all the relevant errors at a given time are displayed. You can also use `field.state.meta.errorMap` to get errors based on _when_ the validation was done (onChange, onBlur etc...). More info about displaying errors below.

## Displaying Errors

Once you have your validation in place, you can map the errors from an array to be displayed in your UI:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <ng-container
      [tanstackField]="form"
      name="age"
      [validators]="{
        onChange: ageValidator
      }"
      #age="field"
    >
      <!-- ... -->
      @if (age.api.state.meta.errors) {
        <em role="alert">{{ age.api.state.meta.errors.join(', ') }}</em>
      }
    </ng-container>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  ageValidator: FieldValidateFn<any, any, any, any, number> = ({ value }) =>
    value < 13 ? 'You must be 13 to make an account' : undefined

  // ...
}
```

Or use the `errorMap` property to access the specific error you're looking for:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <ng-container
      [tanstackField]="form"
      name="age"
      [validators]="{
        onChange: ageValidator
      }"
      #age="field"
    >
      <!-- ... -->
      @if (age.api.state.meta.errorMap['onChange']) {
        <em role="alert">{{ age.api.state.meta.errorMap['onChange'] }}</em>
      }
    </ng-container>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  ageValidator: FieldValidateFn<any, any, any, any, number> = ({ value }) =>
    value < 13 ? 'You must be 13 to make an account' : undefined

  // ...
}
```

It's worth mentioning that our `errors` array and the `errorMap` matches the types returned by the validators. This means that:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <ng-container
      [tanstackField]="form"
      name="age"
      [validators]="{
        onChange: ageValidator
      }"
      #age="field"
    >
      <!-- ... -->
      <!-- errorMap.onChange is type `{isOldEnough: false} | undefined` -->
	  <!-- meta.errors is type `Array<{isOldEnough: false} | undefined>` -->
      @if (!age.api.state.meta.errorMap['onChange']?.isOldEnough) {
        <em role="alert">The user is not old enough</em>
      }
    </ng-container>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  ageValidator: FieldValidateFn<any, any, any, any, number> = ({ value }) =>
    value < 13 ? 'You must be 13 to make an account' : undefined

  // ...
}
```

## Validation at field level vs at form level

As shown above, each `[tanstackField]` accepts its own validation rules via the `onChange`, `onBlur` etc... callbacks. It is also possible to define validation rules at the form level (as opposed to field by field) by passing similar callbacks to the `injectForm()` function.

Example:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <div>
      <ng-container [tanstackField]="form" name="age" #age="field">
        <!-- ... -->
        @if (formErrorMap().onChange) {
          <div>
            <em
              >There was an error on the form: {{ formErrorMap().onChange }}</em
            >
          </div>
        }
        <!-- ... -->
      </ng-container>
    </div>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  form = injectForm({
    defaultValues: {
      age: 0,
    },
    onSubmit({ value }) {
      console.log(value)
    },
    validators: {
      // Add validators to the form the same way you would add them to a field
      onChange({ value }) {
        if (value.age < 13) {
          return 'Must be 13 or older to sign'
        }
        return undefined
      },
    },
  })

  // Subscribe to the form's error map so that updates to it will render
  formErrorMap = injectStore(this.form, (state) => state.errorMap)
}
```

### Setting field-level errors from the form's validators

You can set errors on the fields from the form's validators. One common use case for this is validating all the fields on submit by calling a single API endpoint in the form's `onSubmitAsync` validator.

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <form (submit)="handleSubmit($event)">
      <div>
        <ng-container
          [tanstackField]="form"
          name="age"
          #ageField="field"
        >
          <label [for]="ageField.api.name">Age:</label>
          <input
            type="number"
            [name]="ageField.api.name"
            [value]="ageField.api.state.value"
            (blur)="ageField.api.handleBlur()"
            (input)="ageField.api.handleChange($any($event).target.valueAsNumber)"
          />
          @if (ageField.api.state.meta.errors.length > 0) {
            <em role="alert">{{ ageField.api.state.meta.errors.join(', ') }}</em>
          }
        </ng-container>
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  `,
})

export class AppComponent {
  form = injectForm({
    defaultValues: {
      age: 0,
      socials: [],
      details: {
        email: '',
      },
    },
    validators: {
      onSubmitAsync: async ({ value }) => {
        // Validate the value on the server
        const hasErrors = await verifyDataOnServer(value)
        if (hasErrors) {
          return {
            form: 'Invalid data', // The `form` key is optional
            fields: {
              age: 'Must be 13 or older to sign',
              // Set errors on nested fields with the field's name
              'socials[0].url': 'The provided URL does not exist',
              'details.email': 'An email is required',
            },
          };
        }

        return null;
      },
    },
  });

  handleSubmit(event: SubmitEvent) {
    event.preventDefault();
    event.stopPropagation();
    this.form.handleSubmit();
  }
}
```

> Will only show `'Must be odd!` even if the 'Too young!' error is returned by the form-level validation.

## Asynchronous Functional Validation

While we suspect most validations will be synchronous, there are many instances where a network call or some other async operation would be useful to validate against.

To do this, we have dedicated `onChangeAsync`, `onBlurAsync`, and other methods that can be used to validate against:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <ng-container
      [tanstackField]="form"
      name="age"
      [validators]="{ onChangeAsync: ageValidator }"
      #age="field"
    >
      <label [for]="age.api.name">Last Name:</label>
      <input
        [id]="age.api.name"
        [name]="age.api.name"
        [value]="age.api.state.value"
        type="number"
        (input)="age.api.handleChange($any($event).target.valueAsNumber)"
      />
      @if (age.api.state.meta.errors) {
        <em role="alert">{{ age.api.state.meta.errors.join(', ') }}</em>
      }
    </ng-container>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  ageValidator: FieldValidateAsyncFn<any, string, number> = async ({
    value,
  }) => {
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
    return value < 13 ? 'You must be 13 to make an account' : undefined
  }

  // ...
}
```

Synchronous and Asynchronous validations can coexist. For example, it is possible to define both `onBlur` and `onBlurAsync` on the same field:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <ng-container
      [tanstackField]="form"
      name="age"
      [validators]="{ onBlur: ensureAge13, onBlurAsync: ensureOlderAge }"
      #age="field"
    >
      <label [for]="age.api.name">Last Name:</label>
      <input
        [id]="age.api.name"
        [name]="age.api.name"
        [value]="age.api.state.value"
        type='number'
        (blur)="age.api.handleBlur()"
        (input)="age.api.handleChange($any($event).target.value)"
      />
      @if (age.api.state.meta.errors) {
        <em role="alert">{{ age.api.state.meta.errors.join(', ') }}</em>
      }
    </ng-container>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  ensureAge13: FieldValidateFn<any, any, any, any, number> = ({ value }) =>
    value < 13 ? 'You must be at least 13' : undefined

  ensureOlderAge: FieldValidateAsyncFn<any, string, number> = async ({
    value,
  }) => {
    const currentAge = await fetchCurrentAgeOnProfile()
    return value < currentAge ? 'You can only increase the age' : undefined
  }

  // ...
}
```

The synchronous validation method (`onBlur`) is run first and the asynchronous method (`onBlurAsync`) is only run if the synchronous one (`onBlur`) succeeds. To change this behaviour, set the `asyncAlways` option to `true`, and the async method will be run regardless of the result of the sync method.

### Built-in Debouncing

While async calls are the way to go when validating against the database, running a network request on every keystroke is a good way to DDOS your database.

Instead, we enable an easy method for debouncing your `async` calls by adding a single property:

```angular-html
<ng-container
  [tanstackField]="form"
  name="age"
  asyncDebounceMs={500}
  [validators]="{ onChangeAsync: someValidator }"
  #age="field"
>
  <!-- ... -->
</ng-container>
```

This will debounce every async call with a 500ms delay. You can even override this property on a per-validation property:

```angular-html
<ng-container
  [tanstackField]="form"
  name="age"
  [validators]="{
    onChangeAsyncDebounceMs: 1500,
    onChangeAsync: someValidator,
    onBlurAsync: otherValidator
  }"
  #age="field"
>
  <!-- ... -->
</ng-container>
```

> This will run `onChangeAsync` every 1500ms while `onBlurAsync` will run every 500ms.

## Validation through Schema Libraries

While functions provide more flexibility and customization over your validation, they can be a bit verbose. To help solve this, there are libraries that provide schema-based validation to make shorthand and type-strict validation substantially easier. You can also define a single schema for your entire form and pass it to the form level, errors will be automatically propagated to the fields.

### Standard Schema Libraries

TanStack Form natively supports all libraries following the [Standard Schema specification](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema), most notably:

- [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/)
- [ArkType](https://arktype.io/)

_Note:_ make sure to use the latest version of the schema libraries as older versions might not support Standard Schema yet.

> Validation will not provide you with transformed values. See [submission handling](../submission-handling.md) for more information.

To use schemas from these libraries you can pass them to the `validators` props as you would do with a custom function:

```angular-ts
import { z } from 'zod'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <ng-container
      [tanstackField]="form"
      name="age"
      [validators]="{
        onChange: z.number().gte(13, 'You must be 13 to make an account'),
      }"
      #age="field"
    >
      <!-- ... -->
    </ng-container>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  form = injectForm({
    // ...
   })

  z = z

  // ...
}
```

Async validations on form and field level are supported as well:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <ng-container
      [tanstackField]="form"
      name="age"
      [validators]="{
        onChange: z.number().gte(13, 'You must be 13 to make an account'),
        onChangeAsyncDebounceMs: 500,
        onChangeAsync: increaseAge
      }"
      #age="field"
    >
      <!-- ... -->
    </ng-container>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  increaseAge = z.number().refine(
    async (value) => {
      const currentAge = await fetchCurrentAgeOnProfile()
      return value >= currentAge
    },
    {
      message: 'You can only increase the age',
    },
  )

  // ...
}
```

If you need even more control over your Standard Schema validation, you can combine a Standard Schema with a callback function like so:

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <ng-container
      [tanstackField]="form"
      name="age"
      [validators]="{ onChangeAsync: ageValidator }"
      #age="field"
    >
      <!-- ... -->
    </ng-container>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  ageValidator: FieldValidateAsyncFn<any, string, number> = async ({
    value,
    fieldApi,
  }) => {
    const errors = fieldApi.parseValueWithSchema(
      z.number().gte(13, 'You must be 13 to make an account'),
    )
    if (errors) return errors

    // continue with your validation
  }

  // ...
}
```

## Preventing invalid forms from being submitted

The `onChange`, `onBlur` etc... callbacks are also run when the form is submitted and the submission is blocked if the form is invalid.

The form state object has a `canSubmit` flag that is false when any field is invalid and the form has been touched (`canSubmit` is true until the form has been touched, even if some fields are "technically" invalid based on their `onChange`/`onBlur` props).

You can subscribe to it via `injectStore` and use the value in order to, for example, disable the submit button when the form is invalid (in practice, disabled buttons are not accessible, use `aria-disabled` instead).

```angular-ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <!-- ... -->
    <button type="submit" [disabled]="!canSubmit()">
      {{ isSubmitting() ? '...' : 'Submit' }}
    </button>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  canSubmit = injectStore(this.form, (state) => state.canSubmit)
  isSubmitting = injectStore(this.form, (state) => state.isSubmitting)

  // ...
}
```

The bare minimum to get started with TanStack Form is to create a form and add a field. Keep in mind that this example does not include any validation or error handling... yet.

```angular-ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core'
import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser'
import { TanStackField, injectForm } from '@tanstack/angular-form'

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TanStackField],
  template: `
    <form (submit)="handleSubmit($event)">
      <div>
        <ng-container
          [tanstackField]="form"
          name="fullName"
          #fullName="field"
        >
          <label [for]="fullName.api.name">First Name:</label>
          <input
            [name]="fullName.api.name"
            [value]="fullName.api.state.value"
            (blur)="fullName.api.handleBlur()"
            (input)="fullName.api.handleChange($any($event).target.value)"
          />
        </ng-container>
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  `,
})
export class AppComponent {
  form = injectForm({
    defaultValues: {
      fullName: '',
    },
    onSubmit({ value }) {
      // Do something with form data
      console.log(value)
    },
  })

  handleSubmit(event: SubmitEvent) {
    event.preventDefault()
    event.stopPropagation()
    this.form.handleSubmit()
  }
}

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent).catch((err) => console.error(err))
```

From here, you'll be ready to explore all of the other features of TanStack Form!

title: Arrays

TanStack Form supports arrays as values in a form, including sub-object values inside of an array.

## Basic Usage

To use an array, you can use `field.state.value` on an array value, as in:

```ts
export class TestForm extends LitElement {
  #form = new TanStackFormController(this, {
    defaultValues: {
      people: [] as Array<{ name: string; age: string }>,
    },
  });
  render() {
    return html`
      <form
        id="form"
        @submit=${(e: Event) => {
          e.preventDefault();
        }}
      >
        <h1>Please enter your details</h1>
        ${this.#form.field(
          {
            name: `people`,
          },
          (peopleField) => {
            return html`${repeat(
              peopleField.state.value,
              (_, index) => index,
              (_, index) => {
                return html` // ... `;
              },
            )} `;
          },
        )}
      </form>
    `;
  }
}
```

This will generate the mapped HTML every time you run pushValue on the field:

```html
<div class="container">
  <button type="button" @click="${()" ="">
    { peopleField.pushValue({name: "",age: ""}) }}> Add Person
  </button>
</div>
```

Finally, you can use a subfield like so:

```ts
return html`
  ${this.#form.field(
    {
      name: `people[${index}].name`,
    },
    (field) => {
      return html`
        <input
          type="text"
          placeholder="Name"
          .value="${field.state.value}"
          @input="${(e: Event) => {
            const target = e.target as HTMLInputElement;
            field.handleChange(target.value);
          }}"
        />
      `;
    },
  )}
`;
```

## Full Example

```typescript
export class TestForm extends LitElement {
  #form = new TanStackFormController(this, {
    defaultValues: {
      people: [] as Array<{ name: string}>,
    },
  });
  render() {
    return html`
      <form
        id="form"
        @submit=${(e: Event) => {
          e.preventDefault();
        }}
      >
        <h1>Please enter your details</h1>
        ${this.#form.field(
          {
            name: `people`,
          },
          (peopleField) => {
            return html`${repeat(
                peopleField.state.value,
                (_, index) => index,
                (_, index) => {
                  return html`
                    ${this.#form.field(
                      {
                        name: `people[${index}].name`,
                      },
                      (field) => {
                        return html` <div>
                          <div class="container">

id: basic-concepts
title: Basic Concepts and Terminology
---

This page introduces the basic concepts and terminology used in the `@tanstack/lit-form` library. Familiarizing yourself with these concepts will help you better understand and work with the library and its usage with Lit.

## Form Options

You can create options for your form so that it can be shared between multiple forms by using the `formOptions` function.

For Example:

```tsx
const formOpts = formOptions({
  defaultValues: {
    firstName: "",
    lastName: "",
    employed: false,
    jobTitle: "",
  } as Employee,
});
```

## Form Instance

A Form Instance is an object that represents an individual form and provides methods and properties for working with the form. You create a form instance using the `TanStackFormController` interface provided by `@tanstack/lit-form`. The `TanStackFormController` is instantiated with the current form's (`this`) class and some default form options. It initializes the form state, handles form submission, and provides methods to manage form fields and their validation.

```tsx
#form = new TanStackFormController(this, {
  defaultValues: {
    firstName: "",
    lastName: "",
    employed: false,
    jobTitle: "",
  } as Employee,
});
```

You may also create a form instance without using `formOptions` by using the standalone `TanStackFormController` API:

```tsx
#form = new TanStackFormController(this, {
  ...formOpts,
});
```

## Field

A Field represents a single form input element, such as a text input or a checkbox. Fields are created using the `field(FieldOptions, callback)` provided by the form instance. The component accepts a `FieldOptions` object and a callback function that receives a `FieldApi` object. This object provides methods to get the current value of the field, handle input changes, and handle blur events.

For Example:

```ts
 ${this.#form.field(
    {
      name: `firstName`,
      validators: {
        onChange: ({ value }) =>
          value.length < 3 ? "Not long enough" : undefined,
        },
      },
      (field: FieldApi<Employee, "firstName">) => {
        return html` <div>
          <label class="first-name-label">First Name</label>
          <input
           id="firstName"
           type="text"
           class="first-name-input"
           placeholder="First Name"
           @blur="${() => field.handleBlur()}"
           .value="${field.state.value}"
           @input="${(event: InputEvent) => {
           if (event.currentTarget) {
            const newValue = (event.currentTarget as HTMLInputElement).value;
            field.handleChange(newValue);
           }
          }}"
        />
      </div>`;
    },
)}
```

## Field State

Each field has its own state, which includes its current value, validation status, error messages, and other metadata. You can access a field's state using its `field.state` property.

```ts
const {
  value,
  meta: { errors, isValidating },
} = field.state;
```

There are four states in the metadata that can be useful to see how the user interacts with a field:

- _"isTouched"_, after the user changes the field or blurs the field
- _"isDirty"_, after the field's value has been changed, even if it's been reverted to the default. Opposite of `isPristine`
- _"isPristine"_, until the user changes the field value. Opposite of `isDirty`
- _"isBlurred"_, after the field has been blurred

```ts
const { isTouched, isDirty, isPristine, isBlurred } = field.state.meta;
```

![Field states](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TanStack/form/main/docs/assets/field-states.png)

## Understanding 'isDirty' in Different Libraries

Non-Persistent `dirty` state

- **Libraries**: React Hook Form (RHF), Formik, Final Form.
- **Behavior**: A field is 'dirty' if its value differs from the default. Reverting to the default value makes it 'clean' again.

Persistent `dirty` state

- **Libraries**: Angular Form, Vue FormKit.
- **Behavior**: A field remains 'dirty' once changed, even if reverted to the default value.

We have chosen the persistent 'dirty' state model. To also support a non-persistent 'dirty' state, we introduce an additional flag:

- _"isDefaultValue"_, whether the field's current value is the default value

```ts
const { isDefaultValue, isTouched } = field.state.meta;

// The following line will re-create the non-Persistent `dirty` functionality.
const nonPersistentIsDirty = !isDefaultValue;
```

### hostConnected()

```ts
hostConnected(): void
```

Defined in: [tanstack-form-controller.ts:249](https://github.com/TanStack/form/blob/main/packages/lit-form/src/tanstack-form-controller.ts#L249)

Called when the host is connected to the component tree. For custom
element hosts, this corresponds to the `connectedCallback()` lifecycle,
which is only called when the component is connected to the document.

#### Returns

`void`

#### Implementation of

```ts
ReactiveController.hostConnected;
```

---

### hostDisconnected()

```ts
hostDisconnected(): void
```

Defined in: [tanstack-form-controller.ts:255](https://github.com/TanStack/form/blob/main/packages/lit-form/src/tanstack-form-controller.ts#L255)

Called when the host is disconnected from the component tree. For custom
element hosts, this corresponds to the `disconnectedCallback()` lifecycle,
which is called the host or an ancestor component is disconnected from the
document.

#### Returns

`void`

#### Implementation of

```ts
ReactiveController.hostDisconnected;
```

title: Quick Start

The bare minimum to get started with TanStack Form is to create a `TanstackFormController` as seen below with the `Employee` interface for our test form:

```ts
interface Employee {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  employed: boolean;
  jobTitle: string;
}

#form = new TanStackFormController()<Employee>(this, {
  defaultValues: {
    firstName: "",
    lastName: "",
    employed: false,
    jobTitle: "",
  },
});
```

In this example `this` references the instance of your `LitElement` in which you want to use TanStack Form.

To wire a form element in your template up with TanStack Form, use the `field` method of `TanstackFormController`.

The first parameter of `field` is `FieldOptions` and the second is callback to render your element.

```ts
field(FieldOptions, callback);
```

Our completed test form should look something like below. The form collects first name from a user input field:

```ts
export class TestForm extends LitElement {
  #form = new TanStackFormController<Employee>(this, {
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: "",
      lastName: "",
      employed: false,
      jobTitle: "",
    },
  });
  render() {
    return html` <p>Please enter your first name></p>
      ${this.#form.field(
        {
          name: `firstName`,
          validators: {
            onChange: ({ value }) => (value.length < 3 ? "Not long enough" : undefined),
          },
        },
        (field: FieldApi<Employee, "firstName">) => {
          return html` <div>
            <label class="first-name-label">First Name</label>
            <input
              id="firstName"
              type="text"
              placeholder="First Name"
              @blur="${() => field.handleBlur()}"
              .value="${field.getValue()}"
              @input="${(event: InputEvent) => {
                if (event.currentTarget) {
                  const newValue = (event.currentTarget as HTMLInputElement).value;
                  field.handleChange(newValue);
                }
              }}"
            />
          </div>`;
        },
      )}`;
  }
}
```

Be aware that you need
to handle updating the element and form yourself as seen in the example above.

title: Arrays
---

TanStack Form supports arrays as values in a form, including sub-object values inside of an array.

## Basic Usage

To use an array, you can use `field.state.value` on an array value:

```jsx
function App() {
  const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      people: [],
    },
  });

  return (
    <form.Field name="people" mode="array">
      {(field) => (
        <div>
          {field.state.value.map((_, i) => {
            // ...
          })}
        </div>
      )}
    </form.Field>
  );
}
```

This will generate the mapped JSX every time you run `pushValue` on `field`:

```jsx
<button onClick={() => field.pushValue({ name: "", age: 0 })} type="button">
  Add person
</button>
```

Finally, you can use a subfield like so:

```jsx
<form.Field key={i} name={`people[${i}].name`}>
  {(subField) => (
    <input
      value={subField.state.value}
      onChange={(e) => subField.handleChange(e.target.value)}
    />
  )}
</form.Field>
```

## Full Example

```jsx
function App() {
  const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      people: [],
    },
    onSubmit({ value }) {
      alert(JSON.stringify(value));
    },
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          e.stopPropagation();
          form.handleSubmit();
        }}
      >
        <form.Field name="people" mode="array">
          {(field) => {
            return (
              <div>
                {field.state.value.map((_, i) => {
                  return (
                    <form.Field key={i} name={`people[${i}].name`}>
                      {(subField) => {
                        return (
                          <div>
                            <label>
                              <div>Name for person {i}</div>
                              <input
                                value={subField.state.value}
                                onChange={(e) => subField.handleChange(e.target.value)}
                              />
                            </label>
                          </div>
                        );
                      }}
                    </form.Field>
                  );
                })}
                <button
                  onClick={() => field.pushValue({ name: "", age: 0 })}
                  type="button"
                >
                  Add person
                </button>
              </div>
            );
          }}
        </form.Field>
        <form.Subscribe
          selector={(state) => [state.canSubmit, state.isSubmitting]}
          children={([canSubmit, isSubmitting]) => (
            <button type="submit" disabled={!canSubmit}>
              {isSubmitting ? "..." : "Submit"}
            </button>
          )}
        />
      </form>

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/react/guides/async-initial-values.md">

id: async-initial-values
title: Async Initial Values
---

Let's say that you want to fetch some data from an API and use it as the initial value of a form.

While this problem sounds simple on the surface, there are hidden complexities you might not have thought of thus far.

For example, you might want to show a loading spinner while the data is being fetched, or you might want to handle errors gracefully.
Likewise, you could also find yourself looking for a way to cache the data so that you don't have to fetch it every time the form is rendered.

While we could implement many of these features from scratch, it would end up looking a lot like another project we maintain: [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query).

As such, this guide shows you how you can mix-n-match TanStack Form with TanStack Query to achieve the desired behavior.

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import { useForm } from '@tanstack/react-form'
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'

export default function App() {
  const {data, isLoading} = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['data'],
    queryFn: async () => {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
      return {firstName: 'FirstName', lastName: "LastName"}
    }
  })

  const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: data?.firstName ?? '',
      lastName: data?.lastName ?? '',
    },
    onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
      // Do something with form data
      console.log(value)
    },
  })

  if (isLoading) return <p>Loading..</p>

  return (
    // ...
  )
}
```

This will show a loading spinner until the data is fetched, and then it will render the form with the fetched data as the initial values.

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/react/guides/basic-concepts.md">
---
id: basic-concepts
title: Basic Concepts and Terminology
---

This page introduces the basic concepts and terminology used in the `@tanstack/react-form` library. Familiarizing yourself with these concepts will help you better understand and work with the library.

## Form Options

You can create options for your form so that it can be shared between multiple forms by using the `formOptions` function.

Example:

```tsx
interface User {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  hobbies: Array<string>;
}
const defaultUser: User = { firstName: "", lastName: "", hobbies: [] };

const formOpts = formOptions({
  defaultValues: defaultUser,
});
```

## Form Instance

A Form Instance is an object that represents an individual form and provides methods and properties for working with the form. You create a form instance using the `useForm` hook provided by the form options. The hook accepts an object with an `onSubmit` function, which is called when the form is submitted.

```tsx
const form = useForm({
  ...formOpts,
  onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
    // Do something with form data
    console.log(value);
  },
});
```

You may also create a form instance without using `formOptions` by using the standalone `useForm` API:

```tsx
interface User {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  hobbies: Array<string>;
}
const defaultUser: User = { firstName: "", lastName: "", hobbies: [] };

const form = useForm({
  defaultValues: defaultUser,
  onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
    // Do something with form data
    console.log(value);
  },
});
```

## Field

A Field represents a single form input element, such as a text input or a checkbox. Fields are created using the form.Field component provided by the form instance. The component accepts a name prop, which should match a key in the form's default values. It also accepts a children prop, which is a render prop function that takes a field object as its argument.

Example:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="firstName"
  children={(field) => (
    <>
      <input
        value={field.state.value}
        onBlur={field.handleBlur}
        onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
      />
      <FieldInfo field={field} />
    </>
  )}
/>
```

## Field State

Each field has its own state, which includes its current value, validation status, error messages, and other metadata. You can access a field's state using the `field.state` property.

Example:

```ts
const {
  value,
  meta: { errors, isValidating },
} = field.state;
```

There are four states in the metadata that can be useful to see how the user interacts with a field:

- _"isTouched"_, after the user changes the field or blurs the field
- _"isDirty"_, after the field's value has been changed, even if it's been reverted to the default. Opposite of `isPristine`
- _"isPristine"_, until the user changes the field value. Opposite of `isDirty`
- _"isBlurred"_, after the field has been blurred

```ts
const { isTouched, isDirty, isPristine, isBlurred } = field.state.meta;
```

![Field states](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TanStack/form/main/docs/assets/field-states.png)

## Understanding 'isDirty' in Different Libraries

Non-Persistent `dirty` state

- **Libraries**: React Hook Form (RHF), Formik, Final Form.
- **Behavior**: A field is 'dirty' if its value differs from the default. Reverting to the default value makes it 'clean' again.

Persistent `dirty` state

- **Libraries**: Angular Form, Vue FormKit.
- **Behavior**: A field remains 'dirty' once changed, even if reverted to the default value.

We have chosen the persistent 'dirty' state model. To also support a non-persistent 'dirty' state, we introduce an additional flag:

- _"isDefaultValue"_, whether the field's current value is the default value

```ts
const { isDefaultValue, isTouched } = field.state.meta;

// The following line will re-create the non-Persistent `dirty` functionality.
const nonPersistentIsDirty = !isDefaultValue;
```

![Field states extended](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TanStack/form/main/docs/assets/field-states-extended.png)

## Field API

The Field API is an object passed to the render prop function when creating a field. It provides methods for working with the field's state.

Example:

```tsx
<input
  value={field.state.value}
  onBlur={field.handleBlur}
  onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
/>
```

## Validation

`@tanstack/react-form` provides both synchronous and asynchronous validation out of the box. Validation functions can be passed to the `form.Field` component using the `validators` prop.

Example:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="firstName"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) =>
      !value
        ? "A first name is required"
        : value.length < 3
          ? "First name must be at least 3 characters"
          : undefined,
    onChangeAsync: async ({ value }) => {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
      return value.includes("error") && 'No "error" allowed in first name';
    },
  }}
  children={(field) => (
    <>
      <input
        value={field.state.value}
        onBlur={field.handleBlur}
        onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
      />
      <FieldInfo field={field} />
    </>
  )}
/>
```

## Validation with Standard Schema Libraries

In addition to hand-rolled validation options, we also support the [Standard Schema](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema) specification.

You can define a schema using any of the libraries implementing the specification and pass it to a form or field validator.

Supported libraries include:

- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) (v3.24.0 or higher)
- [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/) (v1.0.0 or higher)
- [ArkType](https://arktype.io/) (v2.1.20 or higher)
- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) (v1.7.0 or higher)

```tsx
import { z } from "zod";

const userSchema = z.object({
  age: z.number().gte(13, "You must be 13 to make an account"),
});

function App() {
  const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      age: 0,
    },
    validators: {
      onChange: userSchema,
    },
  });
  return (
    <div>
      <form.Field
        name="age"
        children={(field) => {
          return <>{/* ... */}</>;
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Reactivity

`@tanstack/react-form` offers various ways to subscribe to form and field state changes, most notably the `useStore(form.store)` hook and the `form.Subscribe` component. These methods allow you to optimize your form's rendering performance by only updating components when necessary.

Example:

```tsx
const firstName = useStore(form.store, (state) => state.values.firstName)
//...
<form.Subscribe
  selector={(state) => [state.canSubmit, state.isSubmitting]}
  children={([canSubmit, isSubmitting]) => (
    <button type="submit" disabled={!canSubmit}>
      {isSubmitting ? '...' : 'Submit'}
    </button>
  )}
/>
```

It is important to remember that while the `useStore` hook's `selector` prop is optional, it is strongly recommended to provide one, as omitting it will result in unnecessary re-renders.

```tsx
// Correct use
const firstName = useStore(form.store, (state) => state.values.firstName);
const errors = useStore(form.store, (state) => state.errorMap);
// Incorrect use
const store = useStore(form.store);
```

Note: The usage of the `useField` hook to achieve reactivity is discouraged since it is designed to be used thoughtfully within the `form.Field` component. You might want to use `useStore(form.store)` instead.

## Listeners

`@tanstack/react-form` allows you to react to specific triggers and "listen" to them to dispatch side effects.

Example:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="country"
  listeners={{
    onChange: ({ value }) => {
      console.log(`Country changed to: ${value}, resetting province`);
      form.setFieldValue("province", "");
    },
  }}
/>
```

More information can be found at [Listeners](../listeners.md)

## Array Fields

Array fields allow you to manage a list of values within a form, such as a list of hobbies. You can create an array field using the `form.Field` component with the `mode="array"` prop.

When working with array fields, you can use the fields `pushValue`, `removeValue`, `swapValues` and `moveValue` methods to add, remove, and swap values in the array.

Example:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="hobbies"
  mode="array"
  children={(hobbiesField) => (
    <div>
      Hobbies
      <div>
        {!hobbiesField.state.value.length
          ? "No hobbies found."
          : hobbiesField.state.value.map((_, i) => (
              <div key={i}>
                <form.Field
                  name={`hobbies[${i}].name`}
                  children={(field) => {
                    return (
                      <div>
                        <label htmlFor={field.name}>Name:</label>
                        <input
                          id={field.name}
                          name={field.name}
                          value={field.state.value}
                          onBlur={field.handleBlur}
                          onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
                        />
                        <button type="button" onClick={() => hobbiesField.removeValue(i)}>
                          X
                        </button>
                        <FieldInfo field={field} />
                      </div>
                    );
                  }}
                />
                <form.Field
                  name={`hobbies[${i}].description`}
                  children={(field) => {
                    return (
                      <div>
                        <label htmlFor={field.name}>Description:</label>
                        <input
                          id={field.name}
                          name={field.name}
                          value={field.state.value}
                          onBlur={field.handleBlur}
                          onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
                        />
                        <FieldInfo field={field} />
                      </div>
                    );
                  }}
                />
              </div>
            ))}
      </div>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() =>
          hobbiesField.pushValue({
            name: "",
            description: "",
            yearsOfExperience: 0,
          })
        }
      >
        Add hobby
      </button>
    </div>
  )}
/>
```

## Reset Buttons

When using `<button type="reset">` in conjunction with TanStack Form's `form.reset()`, you need to prevent the default HTML reset behavior to avoid unexpected resets of form elements (especially `<select>` elements) to their initial HTML values.
Use `event.preventDefault()` inside the button's `onClick` handler to prevent the native form reset.

Example:

```tsx
<button
  type="reset"
  onClick={(event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    form.reset();
  }}
>
  Reset
</button>
```

Alternatively, you can use `<button type="button">` to prevent the native HTML reset.

```tsx
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={() => {
    form.reset();
  }}
>
  Reset
</button>
```

These are the basic concepts and terminology used in the `@tanstack/react-form` library. Understanding these concepts will help you work more effectively with the library and create complex forms with ease.

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/react/guides/custom-errors.md">
---
id: custom-errors
title: Custom Errors
---

TanStack Form provides complete flexibility in the types of error values you can return from validators. String errors are the most common and easy to work with, but the library allows you to return any type of value from your validators.

As a general rule, any truthy value is considered as an error and will mark the form or field as invalid, while falsy values (`false`, `undefined`, `null`, etc..) mean there is no error, the form or field is valid.

## Return String Values from Forms

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="username"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) =>
      value.length < 3 ? "Username must be at least 3 characters" : undefined,
  }}
/>
```

For form-level validation affecting multiple fields:

```tsx
const form = useForm({
  defaultValues: {
    username: "",
    email: "",
  },
  validators: {
    onChange: ({ value }) => {
      return {
        fields: {
          username: value.username.length < 3 ? "Username too short" : undefined,
          email: !value.email.includes("@") ? "Invalid email" : undefined,
        },
      };
    },
  },
});
```

String errors are the most common type and are easily displayed in your UI:

```tsx
{
  field.state.meta.errors.map((error, i) => (
    <div key={i} className="error">
      {error}
    </div>
  ));
}
```

### Numbers

Useful for representing quantities, thresholds, or magnitudes:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) => (value < 18 ? 18 - value : undefined),
  }}
/>
```

Display in UI:

```tsx
{
  /* TypeScript knows the error is a number based on your validator */
}
<div className="error">
  You need {field.state.meta.errors[0]} more years to be eligible
</div>;
```

### Booleans

Simple flags to indicate error state:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="accepted"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) => (!value ? true : undefined),
  }}
/>
```

Display in UI:

```tsx
{
  field.state.meta.errors[0] === true && (
    <div className="error">You must accept the terms</div>
  );
}
```

### Objects

Rich error objects with multiple properties:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="email"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) => {
      if (!value.includes("@")) {
        return {
          message: "Invalid email format",
          severity: "error",
          code: 1001,
        };
      }
      return undefined;
    },
  }}
/>
```

Display in UI:

```tsx
{
  typeof field.state.meta.errors[0] === "object" && (
    <div className={`error ${field.state.meta.errors[0].severity}`}>
      {field.state.meta.errors[0].message}
      <small> (Code: {field.state.meta.errors[0].code})</small>
    </div>
  );
}
```

in the example above it depends on the event error you want to display.

### Arrays

Multiple error messages for a single field:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="password"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) => {
      const errors = [];
      if (value.length < 8) errors.push("Password too short");
      if (!/[A-Z]/.test(value)) errors.push("Missing uppercase letter");
      if (!/[0-9]/.test(value)) errors.push("Missing number");

      return errors.length ? errors : undefined;
    },
  }}
/>
```

Display in UI:

```tsx
{
  Array.isArray(field.state.meta.errors) && (
    <ul className="error-list">
      {field.state.meta.errors.map((err, i) => (
        <li key={i}>{err}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## The `disableErrorFlat` Prop on Fields

By default, TanStack Form flattens errors from all validation sources (onChange, onBlur, onSubmit) into a single `errors` array. The `disableErrorFlat` prop preserves the error sources:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="email"
  disableErrorFlat
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) => (!value.includes("@") ? "Invalid email format" : undefined),
    onBlur: ({ value }) =>
      !value.endsWith(".com") ? "Only .com domains allowed" : undefined,
    onSubmit: ({ value }) => (value.length < 5 ? "Email too short" : undefined),
  }}
/>
```

Without `disableErrorFlat`, all errors would be combined into `field.state.meta.errors`. With it, you can access errors by their source:

```tsx
{
  field.state.meta.errorMap.onChange && (
    <div className="real-time-error">{field.state.meta.errorMap.onChange}</div>
  );
}

{
  field.state.meta.errorMap.onBlur && (
    <div className="blur-feedback">{field.state.meta.errorMap.onBlur}</div>
  );
}

{
  field.state.meta.errorMap.onSubmit && (
    <div className="submit-error">{field.state.meta.errorMap.onSubmit}</div>
  );
}
```

This is useful for:

- Displaying different types of errors with different UI treatments
- Prioritizing errors (e.g., showing submission errors more prominently)
- Implementing progressive disclosure of errors

## Type Safety of `errors` and `errorMap`

TanStack Form provides strong type safety for error handling. Each key in the `errorMap` has exactly the type returned by its corresponding validator, while the `errors` array contains a union type of all the possible error values from all validators:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="password"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) => {
      // This returns a string or undefined
      return value.length < 8 ? "Too short" : undefined;
    },
    onBlur: ({ value }) => {
      // This returns an object or undefined
      if (!/[A-Z]/.test(value)) {
        return { message: "Missing uppercase", level: "warning" };
      }
      return undefined;
    },
  }}
  children={(field) => {
    // TypeScript knows that errors[0] can be string | { message: string, level: string } | undefined
    const error = field.state.meta.errors[0];

    // Type-safe error handling
    if (typeof error === "string") {
      return <div className="string-error">{error}</div>;
    } else if (error && typeof error === "object") {
      return <div className={error.level}>{error.message}</div>;
    }

    return null;
  }}
/>
```

The `errorMap` property is also fully typed, matching the return types of your validation functions:

```tsx
// With disableErrorFlat
<form.Field
  name="email"
  disableErrorFlat
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }): string | undefined =>
      !value.includes("@") ? "Invalid email" : undefined,
    onBlur: ({ value }): { code: number, message: string } | undefined =>
      !value.endsWith(".com") ? { code: 100, message: "Wrong domain" } : undefined
  }}
  children={(field) => {
    // TypeScript knows the exact type of each error source
    const onChangeError: string | undefined = field.state.meta.errorMap.onChange;
    const onBlurError: { code: number, message: string } | undefined = field.state.meta.errorMap.onBlur;

    return (/* ... */);
  }}
/>
```

This type safety helps catch errors at compile time instead of runtime, making your code more reliable and maintainable.

Here's a list of common errors you might see in the console and how to fix them.

## Changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled

If you see this error in the console:

```
Warning: A component is changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled. This is likely caused by the value changing from undefined to a defined value, which should not happen. Decide between using a controlled or uncontrolled input element for the lifetime of the component. More info: https://reactjs.org/link/controlled-components
```

It's likely you forgot the `defaultValues` in your `useForm` Hook or `form.Field` component usage. This is occurring
because the input is being rendered before the form value is initialized and is therefore changing from `undefined` to `""` when a text input is made.

## Field value is of type `unknown`

If you're using `form.Field` and, upon inspecting the value of `field.state.value`, you see that the value of a field is of type `unknown`, it's likely that your form's type was too large for us to safely evaluate.

This typically is a sign that you should break down your form into smaller forms or use a more specific type for your form.

A workaround to this problem is to cast `field.state.value` using TypeScript's `as` keyword:

```tsx
const value = field.state.value as string;
```

## `Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite`

If you see this error in the console when running `tsc`:

```
Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite
```

You've ran into a bug that we didn't catch in our type definitions. While we've done our best to make sure our types are as accurate as possible, there are some edge cases where TypeScript struggled with the complexity of our types.

Please [report this issue to us on GitHub](https://github.com/TanStack/form/issues) so we can fix it. Just make sure to include a minimal reproduction so that we're able to help you debug.

> Keep in mind that this error is a TypeScript error and not a runtime error. This means that your code will still run on the user's machine as expected.

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/react/guides/form-composition.md">
---
id: form-composition
title: Form Composition
---

A common criticism of TanStack Form is its verbosity out-of-the-box. While this _can_ be useful for educational purposes - helping enforce understanding our APIs - it's not ideal in production use cases.

As a result, while `form.Field` enables the most powerful and flexible usage of TanStack Form, we provide APIs that wrap it and make your application code less verbose.

## Custom Form Hooks

The most powerful way to compose forms is to create custom form hooks. This allows you to create a form hook that is tailored to your application's needs, including pre-bound custom UI components and more.

At it's most basic, `createFormHook` is a function that takes a `fieldContext` and `formContext` and returns a `useAppForm` hook.

> This un-customized `useAppForm` hook is identical to `useForm`, but that will quickly change as we add more options to `createFormHook`.

```tsx
import { createFormHookContexts, createFormHook } from "@tanstack/react-form";

// export useFieldContext for use in your custom components
export const { fieldContext, formContext, useFieldContext } = createFormHookContexts();

const { useAppForm } = createFormHook({
  fieldContext,
  formContext,
  // We'll learn more about these options later
  fieldComponents: {},
  formComponents: {},
});

function App() {
  const form = useAppForm({
    // Supports all useForm options
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: "John",
      lastName: "Doe",
    },
  });

  return <form.Field />; // ...
}
```

### Pre-bound Field Components

Once this scaffolding is in place, you can start adding custom field and form components to your form hook.

> Note: the `useFieldContext` must be the same one exported from your custom form context

```tsx
import { useFieldContext } from "./form-context.tsx";

export function TextField({ label }: { label: string }) {
  // The `Field` infers that it should have a `value` type of `string`
  const field = useFieldContext<string>();
  return (
    <label>
      <div>{label}</div>
      <input
        value={field.state.value}
        onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
      />
    </label>
  );
}
```

You're then able to register this component with your form hook.

```tsx
import { TextField } from "./text-field.tsx";

const { useAppForm } = createFormHook({
  fieldContext,
  formContext,
  fieldComponents: {
    TextField,
  },
  formComponents: {},
});
```

And use it in your form:

```tsx
function App() {
  const form = useAppForm({
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: "John",
      lastName: "Doe",
    },
  });

  return (
    // Notice the `AppField` instead of `Field`; `AppField` provides the required context
    <form.AppField
      name="firstName"
      children={(field) => <field.TextField label="First Name" />}
    />
  );
}
```

This not only allows you to reuse the UI of your shared component, but retains the type-safety you'd expect from TanStack Form: Typo `name` and get a TypeScript error.

#### A note on performance

While context is a valuable tool in the React ecosystem, there's appropriate concern from many users that providing a reactive value through a context will cause unnecessary re-renders.

> Unfamiliar with this performance concern? [Mark Erikson's blog post explaining why Redux solves many of these problems](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2021/01/context-redux-differences/) is a great place to start.

While this is a good concern to call out, it's not a problem for TanStack Form; the values provided through context are not reactive themselves, but instead are static class instances with reactive properties ([using TanStack Store as our signals implementation to power the show](https://tanstack.com/store)).

### Pre-bound Form Components

While `form.AppField` solves many of the problems with Field boilerplate and reusability, it doesn't solve the problem of _form_ boilerplate and reusability.

In particular, being able to share instances of `form.Subscribe` for, say, a reactive form submission button is a common usecase.

```tsx
function SubscribeButton({ label }: { label: string }) {
  const form = useFormContext();
  return (
    <form.Subscribe selector={(state) => state.isSubmitting}>
      {(isSubmitting) => (
        <button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting}>
          {label}
        </button>
      )}
    </form.Subscribe>
  );
}

const { useAppForm, withForm } = createFormHook({
  fieldComponents: {},
  formComponents: {
    SubscribeButton,
  },
  fieldContext,
  formContext,
});

function App() {
  const form = useAppForm({
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: "John",
      lastName: "Doe",
    },
  });

  return (
    <form.AppForm>
      // Notice the `AppForm` component wrapper; `AppForm` provides the required context
      <form.SubscribeButton label="Submit" />
    </form.AppForm>
  );
}
```

## Breaking big forms into smaller pieces

Sometimes forms get very large; it's just how it goes sometimes. While TanStack Form supports large forms well, it's never fun to work with hundreds or thousands of lines of code long files.

To solve this, we support breaking forms into smaller pieces using the `withForm` higher-order component.

```tsx
const { useAppForm, withForm } = createFormHook({
  fieldComponents: {
    TextField,
  },
  formComponents: {
    SubscribeButton,
  },
  fieldContext,
  formContext,
});

const ChildForm = withForm({
  // These values are only used for type-checking, and are not used at runtime
  // This allows you to `...formOpts` from `formOptions` without needing to redeclare the options
  defaultValues: {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
  },
  // Optional, but adds props to the `render` function in addition to `form`
  props: {
    // These props are also set as default values for the `render` function
    title: "Child Form",
  },
  render: function Render({ form, title }) {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{title}</p>
        <form.AppField
          name="firstName"
          children={(field) => <field.TextField label="First Name" />}
        />
        <form.AppForm>
          <form.SubscribeButton label="Submit" />
        </form.AppForm>
      </div>
    );
  },
});

function App() {
  const form = useAppForm({
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: "John",
      lastName: "Doe",
    },
  });

  return <ChildForm form={form} title={"Testing"} />;
}
```

### `withForm` FAQ

> Why a higher-order component instead of a hook?

While hooks are the future of React, higher-order components are still a powerful tool for composition. In particular, the API of `withForm` enables us to have strong type-safety without requiring users to pass generics.

> Why am I getting ESLint errors about hooks in `render`?

ESLint looks for hooks in the top-level of a function, and `render` may not be recogized as a top-level component, depending on how you defined it.

```tsx
// This will cause ESLint errors with hooks usage
const ChildForm = withForm({
  // ...
  render: ({ form, title }) => {
    // ...
  },
});
```

```tsx
// This works fine
const ChildForm = withForm({
  // ...
  render: function Render({ form, title }) {
    // ...
  },
});
```

## Reusing groups of fields in multiple forms

Sometimes, a pair of fields are so closely related that it makes sense to group and reuse them — like the password example listed in the [linked fields guide](../linked-fields.md). Instead of repeating this logic across multiple forms, you can utilize the `withFieldGroup` higher-order component.

> Unlike `withForm`, validators cannot be specified and could be any value.
> Ensure that your fields can accept unknown error types.

Rewriting the passwords example using `withFieldGroup` would look like this:

```tsx
const { useAppForm, withForm, withFieldGroup } = createFormHook({
  fieldComponents: {
    TextField,
    ErrorInfo,
  },
  formComponents: {
    SubscribeButton,
  },
  fieldContext,
  formContext,
});

type PasswordFields = {
  password: string;
  confirm_password: string;
};

// These default values are not used at runtime, but the keys are needed for mapping purposes.
// This allows you to spread `formOptions` without needing to redeclare it.
const defaultValues: PasswordFields = {
  password: "",
  confirm_password: "",
};

const FieldGroupPasswordField = withFieldGroup({
  defaultValues,
  // You may also restrict the group to only use forms that implement this submit meta.
  // If none is provided, any form with the right defaultValues may use it.
  // onSubmitMeta: { action: '' }

  // Optional, but adds props to the `render` function in addition to `form`
  props: {
    // These default values are also for type-checking and are not used at runtime
    title: "Password",
  },
  // Internally, you will have access to a `group` instead of a `form`
  render: function Render({ group, title }) {
    // access reactive values using the group store
    const password = useStore(group.store, (state) => state.values.password);
    // or the form itself
    const isSubmitting = useStore(group.form.store, (state) => state.isSubmitting);

    return (
      <div>
        <h2>{title}</h2>
        {/* Groups also have access to Field, Subscribe, Field, AppField and AppForm */}
        <group.AppField name="password">
          {(field) => <field.TextField label="Password" />}
        </group.AppField>
        <group.AppField
          name="confirm_password"
          validators={{
            onChangeListenTo: ["password"],
            onChange: ({ value, fieldApi }) => {
              // The form could be any values, so it is typed as 'unknown'
              const values: unknown = fieldApi.form.state.values;
              // use the group methods instead
              if (value !== group.getFieldValue("password")) {
                return "Passwords do not match";
              }
              return undefined;
            },
          }}
        >
          {(field) => (
            <div>
              <field.TextField label="Confirm Password" />
              <field.ErrorInfo />
            </div>
          )}
        </group.AppField>
      </div>
    );
  },
});
```

We can now use these grouped fields in any form that implements the default values:

```tsx
// You are allowed to extend the group fields as long as the
// existing properties remain unchanged
type Account = PasswordFields & {
  provider: string;
  username: string;
};

// You may nest the group fields wherever you want
type FormValues = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  account_data: PasswordFields;
  linked_accounts: Account[];
};

const defaultValues: FormValues = {
  name: "",
  age: 0,
  account_data: {
    password: "",
    confirm_password: "",
  },
  linked_accounts: [
    {
      provider: "TanStack",
      username: "",
      password: "",
      confirm_password: "",
    },
  ],
};

function App() {
  const form = useAppForm({
    defaultValues,
    // If the group didn't specify an `onSubmitMeta` property,
    // the form may implement any meta it wants.
    // Otherwise, the meta must be defined and match.
    onSubmitMeta: { action: "" },
  });

  return (
    <form.AppForm>
      <PasswordFields
        form={form}
        // You must specify where the fields can be found
        fields="account_data"
        title="Passwords"
      />
      <form.Field name="linked_accounts" mode="array">
        {(field) =>
          field.state.value.map((account, i) => (
            <PasswordFields
              key={account.provider}
              form={form}
              // The fields may be in nested fields
              fields={`linked_accounts[${i}]`}
              title={account.provider}
            />
          ))
        }
      </form.Field>
    </form.AppForm>
  );
}
```

### Mapping field group values to a different field

You may want to keep the password fields on the top level of your form, or rename the properties for clarity. You can map field group values
to their true location by changing the `field` property:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to TypeScript limitations, field mapping is only allowed for objects. You can use records or arrays at the top level of a field group, but you will not be able to map the fields.

```tsx
// To have an easier form, you can keep the fields on the top level
type FormValues = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  password: string;
  confirm_password: string;
};

const defaultValues: FormValues = {
  name: "",
  age: 0,
  password: "",
  confirm_password: "",
};

function App() {
  const form = useAppForm({
    defaultValues,
  });

  return (
    <form.AppForm>
      <PasswordFields
        form={form}
        // You can map the fields to their equivalent deep key
        fields={{
          password: "password",
          confirm_password: "confirm_password",
          // or map them to differently named keys entirely
          // 'password': 'name'
        }}
        title="Passwords"
      />
    </form.AppForm>
  );
}
```

If you expect your fields to always be at the top level of your form, you can create a quick map
of your field groups using a helper function:

```tsx
const defaultValues: PasswordFields = {
  password: '',
  confirm_password: '',
}

const passwordFields = createFieldMap(defaultValues)
/* This generates the following map:
 {
    'password': 'password',
    'confirm_password': 'confirm_password'
 }
*/

// Usage:
<PasswordFields
  form={form}
  fields={passwordFields}
  title="Passwords"
/>
```

## Tree-shaking form and field components

While the above examples are great for getting started, they're not ideal for certain use-cases where you might have hundreds of form and field components.
In particular, you may not want to include all of your form and field components in the bundle of every file that uses your form hook.

To solve this, you can mix the `createFormHook` TanStack API with the React `lazy` and `Suspense` components:

```typescript
// src/hooks/form-context.ts
import { createFormHookContexts } from "@tanstack/react-form";

export const { fieldContext, useFieldContext, formContext, useFormContext } =
  createFormHookContexts();
```

```tsx
// src/components/text-field.tsx
import { useFieldContext } from "../hooks/form-context.tsx";

export default function TextField({ label }: { label: string }) {
  const field = useFieldContext<string>();

  return (
    <label>
      <div>{label}</div>
      <input
        value={field.state.value}
        onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
      />
    </label>
  );
}
```

```tsx
// src/hooks/form.ts
import { lazy } from "react";
import { createFormHook } from "@tanstack/react-form";

const TextField = lazy(() => import("../components/text-fields.tsx"));

const { useAppForm, withForm } = createFormHook({
  fieldContext,
  formContext,
  fieldComponents: {
    TextField,
  },
  formComponents: {},
});
```

```tsx
// src/App.tsx
import { Suspense } from "react";
import { PeoplePage } from "./features/people/form.tsx";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
      <PeoplePage />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

This will show the Suspense fallback while the `TextField` component is being loaded, and then render the form once it's loaded.

## Putting it all together

Now that we've covered the basics of creating custom form hooks, let's put it all together in a single example.

```tsx
// /src/hooks/form.ts, to be used across the entire app
const { fieldContext, useFieldContext, formContext, useFormContext } =
  createFormHookContexts();

function TextField({ label }: { label: string }) {
  const field = useFieldContext<string>();
  return (
    <label>
      <div>{label}</div>
      <input
        value={field.state.value}
        onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
      />
    </label>
  );
}

function SubscribeButton({ label }: { label: string }) {
  const form = useFormContext();
  return (
    <form.Subscribe selector={(state) => state.isSubmitting}>
      {(isSubmitting) => <button disabled={isSubmitting}>{label}</button>}
    </form.Subscribe>
  );
}

const { useAppForm, withForm } = createFormHook({
  fieldComponents: {
    TextField,
  },
  formComponents: {
    SubscribeButton,
  },
  fieldContext,
  formContext,
});

// /src/features/people/shared-form.ts, to be used across `people` features
const formOpts = formOptions({
  defaultValues: {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
  },
});

// /src/features/people/nested-form.ts, to be used in the `people` page
const ChildForm = withForm({
  ...formOpts,
  // Optional, but adds props to the `render` function outside of `form`
  props: {
    title: "Child Form",
  },
  render: ({ form, title }) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{title}</p>
        <form.AppField
          name="firstName"
          children={(field) => <field.TextField label="First Name" />}
        />
        <form.AppForm>
          <form.SubscribeButton label="Submit" />
        </form.AppForm>
      </div>
    );
  },
});

// /src/features/people/page.ts
const Parent = () => {
  const form = useAppForm({
    ...formOpts,
  });

  return <ChildForm form={form} title={"Testing"} />;
};
```

## API Usage Guidance

Here's a chart to help you decide what APIs you should be using:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TanStack/form/main/docs/assets/react_form_composability.svg)
</file>

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/react/guides/linked-fields.md">

id: linked-fields
title: Link Two Form Fields Together
---

You may find yourself needing to link two fields together; when one is validated as another field's value has changed.
One such usage is when you have both a `password` and `confirm_password` field,
where you want to `confirm_password` to error out when `password`'s value does not match;
regardless of which field triggered the value change.

Imagine the following userflow:

- User updates confirm password field.
- User updates the non-confirm password field.

In this example, the form will still have errors present,
as the "confirm password" field validation has not been re-ran to mark as accepted.

To solve this, we need to make sure that the "confirm password" validation is re-run when the password field is updated.
To do this, you can add a `onChangeListenTo` property to the `confirm_password` field.

```tsx
function App() {
  const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      password: "",
      confirm_password: "",
    },
    // ...
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <form.Field name="password">
        {(field) => (
          <label>
            <div>Password</div>
            <input
              value={field.state.value}
              onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
            />
          </label>
        )}
      </form.Field>
      <form.Field
        name="confirm_password"
        validators={{
          onChangeListenTo: ["password"],
          onChange: ({ value, fieldApi }) => {
            if (value !== fieldApi.form.getFieldValue("password")) {
              return "Passwords do not match";
            }
            return undefined;
          },
        }}
      >
        {(field) => (
          <div>
            <label>
              <div>Confirm Password</div>
              <input
                value={field.state.value}
                onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
              />
            </label>
            {field.state.meta.errors.map((err) => (
              <div key={err}>{err}</div>
            ))}
          </div>
        )}
      </form.Field>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This similarly works with `onBlurListenTo` property, which will re-run the validation when the field is blurred.
</file>

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/react/guides/listeners.md">
---
id: listeners
title: Side effects for event triggers
---

For situations where you want to "affect" or "react" to triggers, there's the listener API. For example, if you, as the developer, want to reset a form field as a result of another field changing, you would use the listener API.

Imagine the following user flow:

- User selects a country from a drop-down.
- User then selects a province from another drop-down.
- User changes the selected country to a different one.

In this example, when the user changes the country, the selected province needs to be reset as it's no longer valid. With the listener API, we can subscribe to the onChange event and dispatch a reset to the field "province" when the listener is fired.

Events that can be "listened" to are:

- `onChange`
- `onBlur`
- `onMount`
- `onSubmit`

```tsx
function App() {
  const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      country: "",
      province: "",
    },
    // ...
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <form.Field
        name="country"
        listeners={{
          onChange: ({ value }) => {
            console.log(`Country changed to: ${value}, resetting province`);
            form.setFieldValue("province", "");
          },
        }}
      >
        {(field) => (
          <label>
            <div>Country</div>
            <input
              value={field.state.value}
              onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
            />
          </label>
        )}
      </form.Field>

      <form.Field name="province">
        {(field) => (
          <label>
            <div>Province</div>
            <input
              value={field.state.value}
              onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
            />
          </label>
        )}
      </form.Field>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Built-in Debouncing

If you are making an API request inside a listener, you may want to debounce the calls as it can lead to performance issues.
We enable an easy method for debouncing your listeners by adding a `onChangeDebounceMs` or `onBlurDebounceMs`.

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="country"
  listeners={{
    onChangeDebounceMs: 500, // 500ms debounce
    onChange: ({ value }) => {
      console.log(`Country changed to: ${value} without a change within 500ms, resetting province`)
      form.setFieldValue('province', '')
    },
  }}
>
  {(field) => (
    /* ... */
  )}
</form.Field>
```

### Form listeners

At a higher level, listeners are also available at the form level, allowing you access to the `onMount` and `onSubmit` events, and having `onChange` and `onBlur` propagated to all the form's children. Form-level listeners can also be debounced in the same way as previously discussed.

`onMount` and `onSubmit` listeners have to following props:

- `formApi`

`onChange` and `onBlur` listeners have access to:

- `fieldApi`
- `formApi`

```tsx
const form = useForm({
  listeners: {
    onMount: ({ formApi }) => {
      // custom logging service
      loggingService("mount", formApi.state.values);
    },

    onChange: ({ formApi, fieldApi }) => {
      // autosave logic
      if (formApi.state.isValid) {
        formApi.handleSubmit();
      }

      // fieldApi represents the field that triggered the event.
      console.log(fieldApi.name, fieldApi.state.value);
    },
    onChangeDebounceMs: 500,
  },
});
```

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/react/guides/react-native.md">

id: react-native
title: Usage with React Native
---

TanStack Form is headless and it should support React Native out-of-the-box without needing any additional configuration.

Here is an example:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: (val) => (val < 13 ? "You must be 13 to make an account" : undefined),
  }}
>
  {(field) => (
    <>
      <Text>Age:</Text>
      <TextInput value={field.state.value} onChangeText={field.handleChange} />
      {!field.state.meta.isValid && <Text>{field.state.meta.errors.join(", ")}</Text>}
    </>
  )}
</form.Field>
```
</file>

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/react/guides/reactivity.md">
---
id: reactivity
title: Reactivity
---

Tanstack Form doesn't cause re-renders when interacting with the form. So you might find yourself trying to use a form or field state value without success.

If you would like to access reactive values, you will need to subscribe to them using one of two methods: `useStore` or the `form.Subscribe` component.

Some uses for these subscriptions are rendering up-to-date field values, determining what to render based on a condition, or using field values inside the logic of your component.

> For situations where you want to "react" to triggers, check out the [listener](../listeners.md) API.

## useStore

The `useStore` hook is perfect when you need to access form values within the logic of your component. `useStore` takes two parameters. First, the form store. Second a selector to fine tune the piece of the form you wish to subscribe to.

```tsx
const firstName = useStore(form.store, (state) => state.values.firstName);
const errors = useStore(form.store, (state) => state.errorMap);
```

You can access any piece of the form state in the selector.

> Note, that `useStore` will cause a whole component re-render whenever the value subscribed to changes.

While it IS possible to omit the selector, resist the urge as omitting it would result in many unnecessary re-renders whenever any of the form state changes.

## form.Subscribe

The `form.Subscribe` component is best suited when you need to react to something within the UI of your component. For example, showing or hiding ui based on the value of a form field.

```tsx
<form.Subscribe
  selector={(state) => state.values.firstName}
  children={(firstName) => (
    <form.Field>
      {(field) => (
        <input
          name="lastName"
          value={field.state.lastName}
          onChange={field.handleChange}
        />
      )}
    </form.Field>
  )}
/>
```

> The `form.Subscribe` component doesn't trigger component-level re-renders. Anytime the value subscribed to changes, only the `form.Subscribe` component re-renders.

The choice between whether to use `useStore` or `form.Subscribe` mainly boils down to that if it's rendered in the ui, reach for `form.Subscribe` for its optimizations perks, and if you need the reactivity within the logic, then `useStore` is the choice to make.

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/react/guides/ssr.md">
---
id: ssr
title: React Meta-Framework Usage
---

TanStack Form is compatible with React out of the box, supporting `SSR` and being framework-agnostic. However, specific configurations are necessary, according to your chosen framework.

Today we support the following meta-frameworks:

- [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Remix](https://remix.run)

## Using TanStack Form in TanStack Start

This section focuses on integrating TanStack Form with TanStack Start.

### TanStack Start Prerequisites

- Start a new `TanStack Start` project, following the steps in the [TanStack Start Quickstart Guide](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/tanstack-start)
- Install `@tanstack/react-form`

### Start integration

Let's start by creating a `formOption` that we'll use to share the form's shape across the client and server.

```typescript
// app/routes/index.tsx, but can be extracted to any other path
import { formOptions } from "@tanstack/react-form";

// You can pass other form options here
export const formOpts = formOptions({
  defaultValues: {
    firstName: "",
    age: 0,
  },
});
```

Next, we can create [a Start Server Function](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/server-functions) that will handle the form submission on the server.

```typescript
// app/routes/index.tsx, but can be extracted to any other path
import { createServerValidate, ServerValidateError } from "@tanstack/react-form/start";

const serverValidate = createServerValidate({
  ...formOpts,
  onServerValidate: ({ value }) => {
    if (value.age < 12) {
      return "Server validation: You must be at least 12 to sign up";
    }
  },
});

export const handleForm = createServerFn({
  method: "POST",
})
  .validator((data: unknown) => {
    if (!(data instanceof FormData)) {
      throw new Error("Invalid form data");
    }
    return data;
  })
  .handler(async (ctx) => {
    try {
      const validatedData = await serverValidate(ctx.data);
      console.log("validatedData", validatedData);
      // Persist the form data to the database
      // await sql`
      //   INSERT INTO users (name, email, password)
      //   VALUES (${validatedData.name}, ${validatedData.email}, ${validatedData.password})
      // `
    } catch (e) {
      if (e instanceof ServerValidateError) {
        // Log form errors or do any other logic here
        return e.response;
      }

      // Some other error occurred when parsing the form
      console.error(e);
      setResponseStatus(500);
      return "There was an internal error";
    }

    return "Form has validated successfully";
  });
```

Then we need to establish a way to grab the form data from `serverValidate`'s `response` using another server action:

```typescript
// app/routes/index.tsx, but can be extracted to any other path
import { getFormData } from "@tanstack/react-form/start";

export const getFormDataFromServer = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(
  async () => {
    return getFormData();
  },
);
```

Finally, we'll use `getFormDataFromServer` in our loader to get the state from our server into our client and `handleForm` in our client-side form component.

```tsx
// app/routes/index.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { mergeForm, useForm, useStore, useTransform } from "@tanstack/react-form";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  component: Home,
  loader: async () => ({
    state: await getFormDataFromServer(),
  }),
});

function Home() {
  const { state } = Route.useLoaderData();
  const form = useForm({
    ...formOpts,
    transform: useTransform((baseForm) => mergeForm(baseForm, state), [state]),
  });

  const formErrors = useStore(form.store, (formState) => formState.errors);

  return (
    <form action={handleForm.url} method="post" encType={"multipart/form-data"}>
      {formErrors.map((error) => (
        <p key={error as string}>{error}</p>
      ))}

      <form.Field
        name="age"
        validators={{
          onChange: ({ value }) =>
            value < 8 ? "Client validation: You must be at least 8" : undefined,
        }}
      >
        {(field) => {
          return (
            <div>
              <input
                name="age"
                type="number"
                value={field.state.value}
                onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
              />
              {field.state.meta.errors.map((error) => (
                <p key={error as string}>{error}</p>
              ))}
            </div>
          );
        }}
      </form.Field>
      <form.Subscribe
        selector={(formState) => [formState.canSubmit, formState.isSubmitting]}
      >
        {([canSubmit, isSubmitting]) => (
          <button type="submit" disabled={!canSubmit}>
            {isSubmitting ? "..." : "Submit"}
          </button>
        )}
      </form.Subscribe>
    </form>
  );
}
```

## Using TanStack Form in a Next.js App Router

> Before reading this section, it's suggested you understand how React Server Components and React Server Actions work. [Check out this blog series for more information](https://playfulprogramming.com/collections/react-beyond-the-render)

This section focuses on integrating TanStack Form with `Next.js`, particularly using the `App Router` and `Server Actions`.

### Next.js Prerequisites

- Start a new `Next.js` project, following the steps in the [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation). Ensure you select `yes` for `Would you like to use App Router?` during the setup to access all new features provided by Next.js.
- Install `@tanstack/react-form`
- Install any [form validator](../validation#validation-through-schema-libraries) of your choice. [Optional]

## App Router integration

Let's start by creating a `formOption` that we'll use to share the form's shape across the client and server.

```typescript
// shared-code.ts
// Notice the import path is different from the client
import { formOptions } from "@tanstack/react-form/nextjs";

// You can pass other form options here
export const formOpts = formOptions({
  defaultValues: {
    firstName: "",
    age: 0,
  },
});
```

Next, we can create [a React Server Action](https://playfulprogramming.com/posts/what-are-react-server-components) that will handle the form submission on the server.

```typescript
// action.ts
"use server";

// Notice the import path is different from the client
import { ServerValidateError, createServerValidate } from "@tanstack/react-form/nextjs";
import { formOpts } from "./shared-code";

// Create the server action that will infer the types of the form from `formOpts`
const serverValidate = createServerValidate({
  ...formOpts,
  onServerValidate: ({ value }) => {
    if (value.age < 12) {
      return "Server validation: You must be at least 12 to sign up";
    }
  },
});

export default async function someAction(prev: unknown, formData: FormData) {
  try {
    const validatedData = await serverValidate(formData);
    console.log("validatedData", validatedData);
    // Persist the form data to the database
    // await sql`
    //   INSERT INTO users (name, email, password)
    //   VALUES (${validatedData.name}, ${validatedData.email}, ${validatedData.password})
    // `
  } catch (e) {
    if (e instanceof ServerValidateError) {
      return e.formState;
    }

    // Some other error occurred while validating your form
    throw e;
  }

  // Your form has successfully validated!
}
```

Finally, we'll use `someAction` in our client-side form component.

```tsx
// client-component.tsx
"use client";

import { useActionState } from "react";
import { initialFormState } from "@tanstack/react-form/nextjs";
// Notice the import is from `react-form`, not `react-form/nextjs`
import { mergeForm, useForm, useStore, useTransform } from "@tanstack/react-form";
import someAction from "./action";
import { formOpts } from "./shared-code";

export const ClientComp = () => {
  const [state, action] = useActionState(someAction, initialFormState);

  const form = useForm({
    ...formOpts,
    transform: useTransform((baseForm) => mergeForm(baseForm, state!), [state]),
  });

  const formErrors = useStore(form.store, (formState) => formState.errors);

  return (
    <form action={action as never} onSubmit={() => form.handleSubmit()}>
      {formErrors.map((error) => (
        <p key={error as string}>{error}</p>
      ))}

      <form.Field
        name="age"
        validators={{
          onChange: ({ value }) =>
            value < 8 ? "Client validation: You must be at least 8" : undefined,
        }}
      >
        {(field) => {
          return (
            <div>
              <input
                name="age"
                type="number"
                value={field.state.value}
                onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
              />
              {field.state.meta.errors.map((error) => (
                <p key={error as string}>{error}</p>
              ))}
            </div>
          );
        }}
      </form.Field>
      <form.Subscribe
        selector={(formState) => [formState.canSubmit, formState.isSubmitting]}
      >
        {([canSubmit, isSubmitting]) => (
          <button type="submit" disabled={!canSubmit}>
            {isSubmitting ? "..." : "Submit"}
          </button>
        )}
      </form.Subscribe>
    </form>
  );
};
```

Here, we're using [React's `useActionState` hook](https://playfulprogramming.com/posts/what-is-use-action-state-and-form-status) and TanStack Form's `useTransform` hook to merge state returned from the server action with the form state.

## Using TanStack Form in Remix

> Before reading this section, it's suggested you understand how Remix actions work. [Check out Remix's docs for more information](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/discussion/data-flow#route-action)

### Remix Prerequisites

- Start a new `Remix` project, following the steps in the [Remix Documentation](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/start/quickstart).
- Install `@tanstack/react-form`
- Install any [form validator](../validation#validation-through-schema-libraries) of your choice. [Optional]

## Remix integration

Let's start by creating a `formOption` that we'll use to share the form's shape across the client and server.

```typescript
// routes/_index/route.tsx
import { formOptions } from "@tanstack/react-form/remix";

// You can pass other form options here
export const formOpts = formOptions({
  defaultValues: {
    firstName: "",
    age: 0,
  },
});
```

Next, we can create [an action](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/discussion/data-flow#route-action) that will handle the form submission on the server.

```tsx
// routes/_index/route.tsx

import {
  ServerValidateError,
  createServerValidate,
  formOptions,
} from "@tanstack/react-form/remix";

import type { ActionFunctionArgs } from "@remix-run/node";

// export const formOpts = formOptions({

// Create the server action that will infer the types of the form from `formOpts`
const serverValidate = createServerValidate({
  ...formOpts,
  onServerValidate: ({ value }) => {
    if (value.age < 12) {
      return "Server validation: You must be at least 12 to sign up";
    }
  },
});

export async function action({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  const formData = await request.formData();
  try {
    const validatedData = await serverValidate(formData);
    console.log("validatedData", validatedData);
    // Persist the form data to the database
    // await sql`
    //   INSERT INTO users (name, email, password)
    //   VALUES (${validatedData.name}, ${validatedData.email}, ${validatedData.password})
    // `
  } catch (e) {
    if (e instanceof ServerValidateError) {
      return e.formState;
    }

    // Some other error occurred while validating your form
    throw e;
  }

  // Your form has successfully validated!
}
```

Finally, the `action` will be called when the form submits.

```tsx
// routes/_index/route.tsx
import { Form, useActionData } from "@remix-run/react";

import { mergeForm, useForm, useStore, useTransform } from "@tanstack/react-form";
import {
  ServerValidateError,
  createServerValidate,
  formOptions,
  initialFormState,
} from "@tanstack/react-form/remix";

import type { ActionFunctionArgs } from "@remix-run/node";

// export const formOpts = formOptions({

// const serverValidate = createServerValidate({

// export async function action({request}: ActionFunctionArgs) {

export default function Index() {
  const actionData = useActionData<typeof action>();

  const form = useForm({
    ...formOpts,
    transform: useTransform(
      (baseForm) => mergeForm(baseForm, actionData ?? initialFormState),
      [actionData],
    ),
  });

  const formErrors = useStore(form.store, (formState) => formState.errors);

  return (
    <Form method="post" onSubmit={() => form.handleSubmit()}>
      {formErrors.map((error) => (
        <p key={error as string}>{error}</p>
      ))}

      <form.Field
        name="age"
        validators={{
          onChange: ({ value }) =>
            value < 8 ? "Client validation: You must be at least 8" : undefined,
        }}
      >
        {(field) => {
          return (
            <div>
              <input
                name="age"
                type="number"
                value={field.state.value}
                onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
              />
              {field.state.meta.errors.map((error) => (
                <p key={error as string}>{error}</p>
              ))}
            </div>
          );
        }}
      </form.Field>
      <form.Subscribe
        selector={(formState) => [formState.canSubmit, formState.isSubmitting]}
      >
        {([canSubmit, isSubmitting]) => (
          <button type="submit" disabled={!canSubmit}>
            {isSubmitting ? "..." : "Submit"}
          </button>
        )}
      </form.Subscribe>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

Here, we're using [Remix's `useActionData` hook](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/hooks/use-action-data) and TanStack Form's `useTransform` hook to merge state returned from the server action with the form state.

id: submission-handling
title: Submission handling
---

## Passing additional data to submission handling

You may have multiple types of submission behaviour, for example, going back to another page or staying on the form.
You can accomplish this by specifying the `onSubmitMeta` property. This meta data will be passed to the `onSubmit` function.

> Note: if `form.handleSubmit()` is called without metadata, it will use the provided default.

```tsx
import { useForm } from "@tanstack/react-form";

type FormMeta = {
  submitAction: "continue" | "backToMenu" | null;
};

// Metadata is not required to call form.handleSubmit().
// Specify what values to use as default if no meta is passed
const defaultMeta: FormMeta = {
  submitAction: null,
};

function App() {
  const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      data: "",
    },
    // Define what meta values to expect on submission
    onSubmitMeta: defaultMeta,
    onSubmit: async ({ value, meta }) => {
      // Do something with the values passed via handleSubmit
      console.log(`Selected action - ${meta.submitAction}`, value);
    },
  });

  return (
    <form
      onSubmit={(e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        e.stopPropagation();
      }}
    >
      {/* ... */}
      <button
        type="submit"
        // Overwrites the default specified in onSubmitMeta
        onClick={() => form.handleSubmit({ submitAction: "continue" })}
      >
        Submit and continue
      </button>
      <button
        type="submit"
        onClick={() => form.handleSubmit({ submitAction: "backToMenu" })}
      >
        Submit and back to menu
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

## Transforming data with Standard Schemas

While Tanstack Form provides [Standard Schema support](../validation.md) for validation, it does not preserve the Schema's output data.

The value passed to the `onSubmit` function will always be the input data. To receive the output data of a Standard Schema, parse it in the `onSubmit` function:

```tsx
const schema = z.object({
  age: z.string().transform((age) => Number(age)),
});

// Tanstack Form uses the input type of Standard Schemas
const defaultValues: z.input<typeof schema> = {
  age: "13",
};

const form = useForm({
  defaultValues,
  validators: {
    onChange: schema,
  },
  onSubmit: ({ value }) => {
    const inputAge: string = value.age;
    // Pass it through the schema to get the transformed value
    const result = schema.parse(value);
    const outputAge: number = result.age;
  },
});
```

## Usage of TanStack Form with UI Libraries

TanStack Form is a headless library, offering you complete flexibility to style it as you see fit. It's compatible with a wide range of UI libraries, including `Tailwind`, `Material UI`, `Mantine`, or even plain CSS.

This guide focuses on `Material UI` and `Mantine`, but the concepts are applicable to any UI library of your choice.

### Prerequisites

Before integrating TanStack Form with a UI library, ensure the necessary dependencies are installed in your project:

- For `Material UI`, follow the installation instructions on their [official site](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/).
- For `Mantine`, refer to their [documentation](https://mantine.dev/).

Note: While you can mix and match libraries, it's generally advisable to stick with one to maintain consistency and minimize bloat.

### Example with Mantine

Here's an example demonstrating the integration of TanStack Form with Mantine components:

```tsx
import { TextInput, Checkbox } from "@mantine/core";
import { useForm } from "@tanstack/react-form";

export default function App() {
  const { Field, handleSubmit, state } = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: "",
      lastName: "",
      isChecked: false,
    },
    onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
      // Handle form submission
      console.log(value);
    },
  });

  return (
    <>
      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          handleSubmit();
        }}
      >
        <Field
          name="firstName"
          children={({ state, handleChange, handleBlur }) => (
            <TextInput
              defaultValue={state.value}
              onChange={(e) => handleChange(e.target.value)}
              onBlur={handleBlur}
              placeholder="Enter your name"
            />
          )}
        />
        <Field
          name="isChecked"
          children={({ state, handleChange, handleBlur }) => (
            <Checkbox
              onChange={(e) => handleChange(e.target.checked)}
              onBlur={handleBlur}
              checked={state.value}
            />
          )}
        />
      </form>
      <div>
        <pre>{JSON.stringify(state.values, null, 2)}</pre>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

- Initially, we utilize the `useForm` hook from TanStack and destructure the necessary properties. This step is optional; alternatively, you could use `const form = useForm()` if preferred. TypeScript's type inference ensures a smooth experience regardless of the approach.
- The `Field` component, derived from `useForm`, accepts several properties, such as `validators`. For this demonstration, we focus on two primary properties: `name` and `children`.
  - The `name` property identifies each `Field`, for instance, `firstName` in our example.
  - The `children` property leverages the concept of render props, allowing us to integrate components without unnecessary abstractions.
- TanStack's design relies heavily on render props, providing access to `children` within the `Field` component. This approach is entirely type-safe. When integrating with Mantine components, such as `TextInput`, we selectively destructure properties like `state.value`, `handleChange`, and `handleBlur`. This selective approach is due to the slight differences in types between `TextInput` and the `field` we get in the children.
- By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate Mantine components with TanStack Form.
- This methodology is equally applicable to other components, such as `Checkbox`, ensuring consistent integration across different UI elements.

### Usage with Material UI

The process for integrating Material UI components is similar. Here's an example using TextField and Checkbox from Material UI:

```tsx
        <Field
            name="lastName"
            children={({ state, handleChange, handleBlur }) => {
              return (
                <TextField
                  id="filled-basic"
                  label="Filled"
                  variant="filled"
                  defaultValue={state.value}
                  onChange={(e) => handleChange(e.target.value)}
                  onBlur={handleBlur}
                  placeholder="Enter your last name"
                />
              );
            }}
          />

           <Field
            name="isMuiCheckBox"
            children={({ state, handleChange, handleBlur }) => {
              return (
                <MuiCheckbox
                  onChange={(e) => handleChange(e.target.checked)}
                  onBlur={handleBlur}
                  checked={state.value}
                />
              );
            }}
          />

```

- The integration approach is the same as with Mantine.
- The primary difference lies in the specific Material UI component properties and styling options.

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/react/guides/validation.md">
---
id: form-validation
title: Form and Field Validation
---

At the core of TanStack Form's functionalities is the concept of validation. TanStack Form makes validation highly customizable:

- You can control when to perform the validation (on change, on input, on blur, on submit...)
- Validation rules can be defined at the field level or at the form level
- Validation can be synchronous or asynchronous (for example, as a result of an API call)

## When is validation performed?

It's up to you! The `<Field />` component accepts some callbacks as props such as `onChange` or `onBlur`. Those callbacks are passed the current value of the field, as well as the fieldAPI object, so that you can perform the validation. If you find a validation error, simply return the error message as string and it will be available in `field.state.meta.errors`.

Here is an example:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) =>
      value < 13 ? "You must be 13 to make an account" : undefined,
  }}
>
  {(field) => (
    <>
      <label htmlFor={field.name}>Age:</label>
      <input
        id={field.name}
        name={field.name}
        value={field.state.value}
        type="number"
        onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
      />
      {!field.state.meta.isValid && (
        <em role="alert">{field.state.meta.errors.join(", ")}</em>
      )}
    </>
  )}
</form.Field>
```

In the example above, the validation is done at each keystroke (`onChange`). If, instead, we wanted the validation to be done when the field is blurred, we would change the code above like so:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onBlur: ({ value }) => (value < 13 ? "You must be 13 to make an account" : undefined),
  }}
>
  {(field) => (
    <>
      <label htmlFor={field.name}>Age:</label>
      <input
        id={field.name}
        name={field.name}
        value={field.state.value}
        type="number"
        // Listen to the onBlur event on the field
        onBlur={field.handleBlur}
        // We always need to implement onChange, so that TanStack Form receives the changes
        onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
      />
      {!field.state.meta.isValid && (
        <em role="alert">{field.state.meta.errors.join(", ")}</em>
      )}
    </>
  )}
</form.Field>
```

So you can control when the validation is done by implementing the desired callback. You can even perform different pieces of validation at different times:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) =>
      value < 13 ? "You must be 13 to make an account" : undefined,
    onBlur: ({ value }) => (value < 0 ? "Invalid value" : undefined),
  }}
>
  {(field) => (
    <>
      <label htmlFor={field.name}>Age:</label>
      <input
        id={field.name}
        name={field.name}
        value={field.state.value}
        type="number"
        // Listen to the onBlur event on the field
        onBlur={field.handleBlur}
        // We always need to implement onChange, so that TanStack Form receives the changes
        onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
      />
      {!field.state.meta.isValid && (
        <em role="alert">{field.state.meta.errors.join(", ")}</em>
      )}
    </>
  )}
</form.Field>
```

In the example above, we are validating different things on the same field at different times (at each keystroke and when blurring the field). Since `field.state.meta.errors` is an array, all the relevant errors at a given time are displayed. You can also use `field.state.meta.errorMap` to get errors based on _when_ the validation was done (onChange, onBlur etc...). More info about displaying errors below.

## Displaying Errors

Once you have your validation in place, you can map the errors from an array to be displayed in your UI:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) =>
      value < 13 ? "You must be 13 to make an account" : undefined,
  }}
>
  {(field) => {
    return (
      <>
        {/* ... */}
        {!field.state.meta.isValid && <em>{field.state.meta.errors.join(",")}</em>}
      </>
    );
  }}
</form.Field>
```

Or use the `errorMap` property to access the specific error you're looking for:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) =>
      value < 13 ? "You must be 13 to make an account" : undefined,
  }}
>
  {(field) => (
    <>
      {/* ... */}
      {field.state.meta.errorMap["onChange"] ? (
        <em>{field.state.meta.errorMap["onChange"]}</em>
      ) : null}
    </>
  )}
</form.Field>
```

It's worth mentioning that our `errors` array and the `errorMap` matches the types returned by the validators. This means that:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) => (value < 13 ? { isOldEnough: false } : undefined),
  }}
>
  {(field) => (
    <>
      {/* ... */}
      {/* errorMap.onChange is type `{isOldEnough: false} | undefined` */}
      {/* meta.errors is type `Array<{isOldEnough: false} | undefined>` */}
      {!field.state.meta.errorMap["onChange"]?.isOldEnough ? (
        <em>The user is not old enough</em>
      ) : null}
    </>
  )}
</form.Field>
```

## Validation at field level vs at form level

As shown above, each `<Field>` accepts its own validation rules via the `onChange`, `onBlur` etc... callbacks. It is also possible to define validation rules at the form level (as opposed to field by field) by passing similar callbacks to the `useForm()` hook.

Example:

```tsx
export default function App() {
  const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      age: 0,
    },
    onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
      console.log(value);
    },
    validators: {
      // Add validators to the form the same way you would add them to a field
      onChange({ value }) {
        if (value.age < 13) {
          return "Must be 13 or older to sign";
        }
        return undefined;
      },
    },
  });

  // Subscribe to the form's error map so that updates to it will render
  // alternately, you can use `form.Subscribe`
  const formErrorMap = useStore(form.store, (state) => state.errorMap);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* ... */}
      {formErrorMap.onChange ? (
        <div>
          <em>There was an error on the form: {formErrorMap.onChange}</em>

      ) : null}
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Setting field-level errors from the form's validators

You can set errors on the fields from the form's validators. One common use case for this is validating all the fields on submit by calling a single API endpoint in the form's `onSubmitAsync` validator.

```tsx
export default function App() {
  const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      age: 0,
      socials: [],
      details: {
        email: "",
      },
    },
    validators: {
      onSubmitAsync: async ({ value }) => {
        // Validate the value on the server
        const hasErrors = await verifyDataOnServer(value);
        if (hasErrors) {
          return {
            form: "Invalid data", // The `form` key is optional
            fields: {
              age: "Must be 13 or older to sign",
              // Set errors on nested fields with the field's name
              "socials[0].url": "The provided URL does not exist",
              "details.email": "An email is required",
            },
          };
        }

        return null;
      },
    },
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          e.stopPropagation();
          void form.handleSubmit();
        }}
      >
        <form.Field name="age">
          {(field) => (
            <>
              <label htmlFor={field.name}>Age:</label>
              <input
                id={field.name}
                name={field.name}
                value={field.state.value}
                type="number"
                onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
              />
              {!field.state.meta.isValid && (
                <em role="alert">{field.state.meta.errors.join(", ")}</em>
              )}
            </>
          )}
        </form.Field>
        <form.Subscribe
          selector={(state) => [state.errorMap]}
          children={([errorMap]) =>
            errorMap.onSubmit ? (
              <div>
                <em>There was an error on the form: {errorMap.onSubmit}</em>
              </div>
            ) : null

> Will only show `'Must be odd!` even if the 'Too young!' error is returned by the form-level validation.

## Asynchronous Functional Validation

While we suspect most validations will be synchronous, there are many instances where a network call or some other async operation would be useful to validate against.

To do this, we have dedicated `onChangeAsync`, `onBlurAsync`, and other methods that can be used to validate against:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChangeAsync: async ({ value }) => {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
      return value < 13 ? "You must be 13 to make an account" : undefined;
    },
  }}
>
  {(field) => (
    <>
      <label htmlFor={field.name}>Age:</label>
      <input
        id={field.name}
        name={field.name}
        value={field.state.value}
        type="number"
        onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
      />
      {!field.state.meta.isValid && (
        <em role="alert">{field.state.meta.errors.join(", ")}</em>
      )}
    </>
  )}
</form.Field>
```

Synchronous and Asynchronous validations can coexist. For example, it is possible to define both `onBlur` and `onBlurAsync` on the same field:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onBlur: ({ value }) => (value < 13 ? "You must be at least 13" : undefined),
    onBlurAsync: async ({ value }) => {
      const currentAge = await fetchCurrentAgeOnProfile();
      return value < currentAge ? "You can only increase the age" : undefined;
    },
  }}
>
  {(field) => (
    <>
      <label htmlFor={field.name}>Age:</label>
      <input
        id={field.name}
        name={field.name}
        value={field.state.value}
        type="number"
        onBlur={field.handleBlur}
        onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
      />
      {!field.state.meta.isValid && (
        <em role="alert">{field.state.meta.errors.join(", ")}</em>
      )}
    </>
  )}
</form.Field>
```

The synchronous validation method (`onBlur`) is run first and the asynchronous method (`onBlurAsync`) is only run if the synchronous one (`onBlur`) succeeds. To change this behaviour, set the `asyncAlways` option to `true`, and the async method will be run regardless of the result of the sync method.

### Built-in Debouncing

While async calls are the way to go when validating against the database, running a network request on every keystroke is a good way to DDOS your database.

Instead, we enable an easy method for debouncing your `async` calls by adding a single property:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  asyncDebounceMs={500}
  validators={{
    onChangeAsync: async ({ value }) => {
      // ...
    },
  }}
  children={(field) => {
    return <>{/* ... */}</>;
  }}
/>
```

This will debounce every async call with a 500ms delay. You can even override this property on a per-validation property:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  asyncDebounceMs={500}
  validators={{
    onChangeAsyncDebounceMs: 1500,
    onChangeAsync: async ({ value }) => {
      // ...
    },
    onBlurAsync: async ({ value }) => {
      // ...
    },
  }}
  children={(field) => {
    return <>{/* ... */}</>;
  }}
/>
```

This will run `onChangeAsync` every 1500ms while `onBlurAsync` will run every 500ms.

## Validation through Schema Libraries

While functions provide more flexibility and customization over your validation, they can be a bit verbose. To help solve this, there are libraries that provide schema-based validation to make shorthand and type-strict validation substantially easier. You can also define a single schema for your entire form and pass it to the form level, errors will be automatically propagated to the fields.

### Standard Schema Libraries

TanStack Form natively supports all libraries following the [Standard Schema specification](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema), most notably:

- [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/)
- [ArkType](https://arktype.io/)
- [Effect/Schema](https://effect.website/docs/schema/standard-schema/)

_Note:_ make sure to use the latest version of the schema libraries as older versions might not support Standard Schema yet.

> Validation will not provide you with transformed values. See [submission handling](../submission-handling.md) for more information.

To use schemas from these libraries you can pass them to the `validators` props as you would do with a custom function:

```tsx
const userSchema = z.object({
  age: z.number().gte(13, "You must be 13 to make an account"),
});

function App() {
  const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      age: 0,
    },
    validators: {
      onChange: userSchema,
    },
  });
  return (
    <div>
      <form.Field
        name="age"
        children={(field) => {
          return <>{/* ... */}</>;
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Async validations on form and field level are supported as well:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: z.number().gte(13, "You must be 13 to make an account"),
    onChangeAsyncDebounceMs: 500,
    onChangeAsync: z.number().refine(
      async (value) => {
        const currentAge = await fetchCurrentAgeOnProfile();
        return value >= currentAge;
      },
      {
        message: "You can only increase the age",
      },
    ),
  }}
  children={(field) => {
    return <>{/* ... */}</>;
  }}
/>
```

If you need even more control over your Standard Schema validation, you can combine a Standard Schema with a callback function like so:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  asyncDebounceMs={500}
  validators={{
    onChangeAsync: async ({ value, fieldApi }) => {
      const errors = fieldApi.parseValueWithSchema(
        z.number().gte(13, "You must be 13 to make an account"),
      );
      if (errors) return errors;
      // continue with your validation
    },
  }}
  children={(field) => {
    return <>{/* ... */}</>;
  }}
/>
```

## Preventing invalid forms from being submitted

The `onChange`, `onBlur` etc... callbacks are also run when the form is submitted and the submission is blocked if the form is invalid.

The form state object has a `canSubmit` flag that is false when any field is invalid and the form has been touched (`canSubmit` is true until the form has been touched, even if some fields are "technically" invalid based on their `onChange`/`onBlur` props).

You can subscribe to it via `form.Subscribe` and use the value in order to, for example, disable the submit button when the form is invalid (in practice, disabled buttons are not accessible, use `aria-disabled` instead).

```tsx
const form = useForm(/* ... */);

return (
  /* ... */

  // Dynamic submit button
  <form.Subscribe
    selector={(state) => [state.canSubmit, state.isSubmitting]}
    children={([canSubmit, isSubmitting]) => (
      <button type="submit" disabled={!canSubmit}>
        {isSubmitting ? "..." : "Submit"}
      </button>
    )}
  />
);
```

TanStack Form is unlike most form libraries you've used before. It's designed for large-scale production usage, with a focus on type safety, performance and composition for an unmatched developer experience.

As a result, we've developed [a philosophy around the library's usage](../../../philosophy.md) that values scalability and long-term developer experience over short and sharable code snippets.

Here's an example of a form following many of our best practices, which will allow you to rapidly develop even high-complexity forms after a short onboarding experience:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { createFormHook, createFormHookContexts } from "@tanstack/react-form";
// Form components that pre-bind events from the form hook; check our "Form Composition" guide for more
import { TextField, NumberField, SubmitButton } from "~our-app/ui-library";
// We also support Valibot, ArkType, and any other standard schema library
import { z } from "zod";

const { fieldContext, formContext } = createFormHookContexts();

// Allow us to bind components to the form to keep type safety but reduce production boilerplate
// Define this once to have a generator of consistent form instances throughout your app
const { useAppForm } = createFormHook({
  fieldComponents: {
    TextField,
    NumberField,
  },
  formComponents: {
    SubmitButton,
  },
  fieldContext,
  formContext,
});

const PeoplePage = () => {
  const form = useAppForm({
    defaultValues: {
      username: "",
      age: 0,
    },
    validators: {
      // Pass a schema or function to validate
      onChange: z.object({
        username: z.string(),
        age: z.number().min(13),
      }),
    },
    onSubmit: ({ value }) => {
      // Do something with form data
      alert(JSON.stringify(value, null, 2));
    },
  });

  return (
    <form
      onSubmit={(e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        form.handleSubmit();
      }}
    >
      <h1>Personal Information</h1>
      {/* Components are bound to `form` and `field` to ensure extreme type safety */}
      {/* Use `form.AppField` to render a component bound to a single field */}
      <form.AppField
        name="username"
        children={(field) => <field.TextField label="Full Name" />}
      />
      {/* The "name" property will throw a TypeScript error if typo'd  */}
      <form.AppField name="age" children={(field) => <field.NumberField label="Age" />} />
      {/* Components in `form.AppForm` have access to the form context */}
      <form.AppForm>
        <form.SubmitButton />
      </form.AppForm>
    </form>
  );
};

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root")!;
ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement).render(<PeoplePage />);
```

While we generally suggest using `createFormHook` for reduced boilerplate in the long-run, we also support one-off components and other behaviors using `useForm` and `form.Field`:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { useForm } from "@tanstack/react-form";

const PeoplePage = () => {
  const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      username: "",
      age: 0,
    },
    onSubmit: ({ value }) => {
      // Do something with form data
      alert(JSON.stringify(value, null, 2));
    },
  });

  return (
    <form.Field
      name="age"
      validators={{
        // We can choose between form-wide and field-specific validators
        onChange: ({ value }) => (value > 13 ? undefined : "Must be 13 or older"),
      }}
      children={(field) => (
        <>
          <input
            name={field.name}
            value={field.state.value}
            onBlur={field.handleBlur}
            type="number"
            onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
          />
          {!field.state.meta.isValid && <em>{field.state.meta.errors.join(",")}</em>}
        </>
      )}
    />
  );
};

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root")!;
ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement).render(<PeoplePage />);
```

All properties from `useForm` can be used in `useAppForm` and all properties from `form.Field` can be used in `form.AppField`.

title: Arrays

TanStack Form supports arrays as values in a form, including sub-object values inside of an array.

## Basic Usage

To use an array, you can use `field.state.value` on an array value in conjunction
with [`Index` from `solid-js`](https://www.solidjs.com/tutorial/flow_index):

```jsx
function App() {
  const form = createForm(() => ({
    defaultValues: {
      people: [],
    },
  }));

  return (
    <form.Field name="people" mode="array">
      {(field) => (
        <Show when={field().state.value.length > 0}>
          {/* Do not change this to `For` or things will not work as-expected */}
          <Index each={field().state.value}>
            {
              (_, i) => null // ...
            }
          </Index>
        </Show>
      )}
    </form.Field>
  );
}
```

> You must use `Index` from `solid-js` and not `For` because `For` will cause the inner components to be re-rendered
> every time the array changes.
>
> This causes the field to lose its value and therefore delete the subfield's value.

This will generate the mapped JSX every time you run `pushValue` on `field`:

```jsx
<button onClick={() => field().pushValue({ name: "", age: 0 })} type="button">
  Add person
</button>
```

Finally, you can use a subfield like so:

```jsx
<form.Field name={`people[${i}].name`}>
  {(subField) => (
    <input
      value={subField().state.value}
      onInput={(e) => {
        subField().handleChange(e.currentTarget.value);
      }}
    />
  )}
</form.Field>
```

## Full Example

```jsx
function App() {
  const form = createForm(() => ({
    defaultValues: {
      people: [],
    },
    onSubmit: ({ value }) => alert(JSON.stringify(value)),
  }));

  return (
    <div>
      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          e.stopPropagation();
          form.handleSubmit();
        }}
      >
        <form.Field name="people">
          {(field) => (
            <div>
              <Show when={field().state.value.length > 0}>
                {/* Do not change this to For or the test will fail */}
                <Index each={field().state.value}>
                  {(_, i) => (
                    <form.Field name={`people[${i}].name`}>
                      {(subField) => (
                        <div>
                          <label>
                            <div>Name for person {i}</div>
                            <input
                              value={subField().state.value}
                              onInput={(e) => {
                                subField().handleChange(e.currentTarget.value);
                              }}
                            />
                          </label>
                        </div>
                      )}
                    </form.Field>
                  )}
                </Index>
              </Show>

              <button
                onClick={() => field().pushValue({ name: "", age: 0 })}
                type="button"
              >
                Add person
              </button>
            </div>
          )}
        </form.Field>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

id: async-initial-values
title: Async Initial Values
---

Let's say that you want to fetch some data from an API and use it as the initial value of a form.

While this problem sounds simple on the surface, there are hidden complexities you might not have thought of thus far.

For example, you might want to show a loading spinner while the data is being fetched, or you might want to handle errors gracefully.
Likewise, you could also find yourself looking for a way to cache the data so that you don't have to fetch it every time the form is rendered.

While we could implement many of these features from scratch, it would end up looking a lot like another project we maintain: [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query).

As such, this guide shows you how you can mix-n-match TanStack Form with TanStack Query to achieve the desired behavior.

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import { createForm } from "@tanstack/solid-form";
import { createQuery } from "@tanstack/solid-query";

export default function App() {
  const { data, isLoading } = createQuery(() => ({
    queryKey: ["data"],
    queryFn: async () => {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
      return { firstName: "FirstName", lastName: "LastName" };
    },
  }));

  const form = createForm(() => ({
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: data?.firstName ?? "",
      lastName: data?.lastName ?? "",
    },
    onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
      // Do something with form data
      console.log(value);
    },
  }));

  if (isLoading) return <p>Loading..</p>;

  return null;
}
```

This will show a loading spinner until the data is fetched, and then it will render the form with the fetched data as the initial values.

id: basic-concepts
title: Basic Concepts and Terminology
---

This page introduces the basic concepts and terminology used in the `@tanstack/solid-form` library. Familiarizing yourself with these concepts will help you better understand and work with the library.

## Form Options

You can create options for your form so that it can be shared between multiple forms by using the `formOptions` function.

Example:

```tsx
const formOpts = formOptions({
  defaultValues: {
    firstName: "",
    lastName: "",
    hobbies: [],
  } as Person,
});
```

## Form Instance

A Form Instance is an object that represents an individual form and provides methods and properties for working with the form. You create a form instance using the `createForm` hook provided by the form options. The hook accepts an object with an `onSubmit` function, which is called when the form is submitted.

```tsx
const form = createForm(() => ({
  ...formOpts,
  onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
    // Do something with form data
    console.log(value);
  },
}));
```

You may also create a form instance without using `formOptions` by using the standalone `createForm` API:

```tsx
const form = createForm<Person>(() => ({
  onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
    // Do something with form data
    console.log(value);
  },
  defaultValues: {
    firstName: "",
    lastName: "",
    hobbies: [],
  },
}));
```

## Field

A Field represents a single form input element, such as a text input or a checkbox. Fields are created using the `form.Field` component provided by the form instance. The component accepts a name prop, which should match a key in the form's default values. It also accepts a children prop, which is a render prop function that takes a field object as its argument.

Example:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="firstName"
  children={(field) => (
    <input
      name={field().name}
      value={field().state.value}
      onBlur={field().handleBlur}
      onInput={(e) => field().handleChange(e.target.value)}
    />
  )}
/>
```

## Field State

Each field has its own state, which includes its current value, validation status, error messages, and other metadata. You can access a field's state using the `field().state` property.

Example:

```ts
const {
  value,
  meta: { errors, isValidating },
} = field().state;
```

There are four states in the metadata that can be useful to see how the user interacts with a field:

- _"isTouched"_, after the user changes the field or blurs the field
- _"isDirty"_, after the field's value has been changed, even if it's been reverted to the default. Opposite of `isPristine`
- _"isPristine"_, until the user changes the field value. Opposite of `isDirty`
- _"isBlurred"_, after the field has been blurred

```ts
const { isTouched, isDirty, isPristine, isBlurred } = field().state.meta;
```

![Field states](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TanStack/form/main/docs/assets/field-states.png)

## Understanding 'isDirty' in Different Libraries

Non-Persistent `dirty` state

- **Libraries**: React Hook Form (RHF), Formik, Final Form.
- **Behavior**: A field is 'dirty' if its value differs from the default. Reverting to the default value makes it 'clean' again.

Persistent `dirty` state

- **Libraries**: Angular Form, Vue FormKit.
- **Behavior**: A field remains 'dirty' once changed, even if reverted to the default value.

We have chosen the persistent 'dirty' state model. To also support a non-persistent 'dirty' state, we introduce an additional flag:

- _"isDefaultValue"_, whether the field's current value is the default value

```ts
const { isDefaultValue, isTouched } = field().state.meta;

// The following line will re-create the non-Persistent `dirty` functionality.
const nonPersistentIsDirty = !isDefaultValue;
```

![Field states extended](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TanStack/form/main/docs/assets/field-states-extended.png)

## Field API

The Field API is an object passed to the render prop function when creating a field. It provides methods for working with the field's state.

Example:

```tsx
<input
  name={field().name}
  value={field().state.value}
  onBlur={field().handleBlur}
  onInput={(e) => field().handleChange(e.target.value)}
/>
```

## Validation

`@tanstack/solid-form` provides both synchronous and asynchronous validation out of the box. Validation functions can be passed to the `form.Field` component using the `validators` prop.

Example:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="firstName"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) =>
      !value
        ? "A first name is required"
        : value.length < 3
          ? "First name must be at least 3 characters"
          : undefined,
    onChangeAsync: async ({ value }) => {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
      return value.includes("error") && 'No "error" allowed in first name';
    },
  }}
  children={(field) => (
    <>
      <input
        name={field().name}
        value={field().state.value}
        onBlur={field().handleBlur}
        onInput={(e) => field().handleChange(e.target.value)}
      />
      <p>{field().state.meta.errors[0]}</p>
    </>
  )}
/>
```

## Validation with Standard Schema Libraries

In addition to hand-rolled validation options, we also support the [Standard Schema](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema) specification.

You can define a schema using any of the libraries implementing the specification and pass it to a form or field validator.

Supported libraries include:

- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) (v3.24.0 or higher)
- [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/) (v1.0.0 or higher)
- [ArkType](https://arktype.io/) (v2.1.20 or higher)
- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) (v1.7.0 or higher)

```tsx
import { z } from "zod";

// ...
<form.Field
  name="firstName"
  validators={{
    onChange: z.string().min(3, "First name must be at least 3 characters"),
    onChangeAsyncDebounceMs: 500,
    onChangeAsync: z.string().refine(
      async (value) => {
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
        return !value.includes("error");
      },
      {
        message: 'No "error" allowed in first name',
      },
    ),
  }}
  children={(field) => (
    <>
      <input
        name={field().name}
        value={field().state.value}
        onBlur={field().handleBlur}
        onInput={(e) => field().handleChange(e.target.value)}
      />
      <p>{field().state.meta.errors[0]}</p>
    </>
  )}
/>;
```

## Reactivity

`@tanstack/solid-form` offers various ways to subscribe to form and field state changes, most notably the `form.useStore` hook and the `form.Subscribe` component. These methods allow you to optimize your form's rendering performance by only updating components when necessary.

Example:

```tsx
const firstName = form.useStore((state) => state.values.firstName)
//...
<form.Subscribe
  selector={(state) => ({
    canSubmit: state.canSubmit,
    isSubmitting: state.isSubmitting,
  })}
  children={(state) => (
    <button type="submit" disabled={!state().canSubmit}>
      {state().isSubmitting ? '...' : 'Submit'}
    </button>
  )}
/>
```

## Array Fields

Array fields allow you to manage a list of values within a form, such as a list of hobbies. You can create an array field using the `form.Field` component with the `mode="array"` prop.

When working with array fields, you can use the fields `pushValue`, `removeValue`, `swapValues` and `moveValue` methods to add, remove, and swap values in the array.

Example:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="hobbies"
  mode="array"
  children={(hobbiesField) => (
    <div>
      Hobbies
      <div>
        <Show when={hobbiesField().state.value.length > 0} fallback={"No hobbies found."}>
          <Index each={hobbiesField().state.value}>
            {(_, i) => (
              <div>
                <form.Field
                  name={`hobbies[${i}].name`}
                  children={(field) => (
                    <div>
                      <label for={field().name}>Name:</label>
                      <input
                        id={field().name}
                        name={field().name}
                        value={field().state.value}
                        onBlur={field().handleBlur}
                        onInput={(e) => field().handleChange(e.target.value)}
                      />
                      <button type="button" onClick={() => hobbiesField().removeValue(i)}>
                        X
                      </button>
                    </div>
                  )}
                />
                <form.Field
                  name={`hobbies[${i}].description`}
                  children={(field) => {
                    return (
                      <div>
                        <label for={field().name}>Description:</label>
                        <input
                          id={field().name}
                          name={field().name}
                          value={field().state.value}
                          onBlur={field().handleBlur}
                          onInput={(e) => field().handleChange(e.target.value)}
                        />
                      </div>
                    );
                  }}
                />
              </div>
            )}
          </Index>
        </Show>
      </div>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() =>
          hobbiesField().pushValue({
            name: "",
            description: "",
            yearsOfExperience: 0,
          })
        }
      >
        Add hobby
      </button>
    </div>
  )}
/>
```

These are the basic concepts and terminology used in the `@tanstack/solid-form` library. Understanding these concepts will help you work more effectively with the library and create complex forms with ease.

id: form-composition
title: Form Composition
---

A common criticism of TanStack Form is its verbosity out-of-the-box. While this _can_ be useful for educational purposes - helping enforce understanding our APIs - it's not ideal in production use cases.

As a result, while `form.Field` enables the most powerful and flexible usage of TanStack Form, we provide APIs that wrap it and make your application code less verbose.

## Custom Form Hooks

The most powerful way to compose forms is to create custom form hooks. This allows you to create a form hook that is tailored to your application's needs, including pre-bound custom UI components and more.

At it's most basic, `createFormHook` is a function that takes a `fieldContext` and `formContext` and returns a `useAppForm` hook.

> This un-customized `useAppForm` hook is identical to `useForm`, but that will quickly change as we add more options to `createFormHook`.

```tsx
import { createFormHookContexts, createFormHook } from "@tanstack/solid-form";

// export useFieldContext for use in your custom components
export const { fieldContext, formContext, useFieldContext } = createFormHookContexts();

const { useAppForm } = createFormHook({
  fieldContext,
  formContext,
  // We'll learn more about these options later
  fieldComponents: {},
  formComponents: {},
});

function App() {
  const form = useAppForm(() => ({
    // Supports all useForm options
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: "John",
      lastName: "Doe",
    },
  }));

  return <form.Field />; // ...
}
```

### Pre-bound Field Components

Once this scaffolding is in place, you can start adding custom field and form components to your form hook.

> Note: the `useFieldContext` must be the same one exported from your custom form context

```tsx
import { useFieldContext } from "./form-context.tsx";

export function TextField(props: { label: string }) {
  // The `Field` infers that it should have a `value` type of `string`
  const field = useFieldContext<string>();
  return (
    <label>
      <div>{props.label}</div>
      <input
        value={field().state.value}
        onChange={(e) => field().handleChange(e.target.value)}
      />
    </label>
  );
}
```

You're then able to register this component with your form hook.

```tsx
import { TextField } from "./text-field.tsx";

const { useAppForm } = createFormHook({
  fieldContext,
  formContext,
  fieldComponents: {
    TextField,
  },
  formComponents: {},
});
```

And use it in your form:

```tsx
function App() {
  const form = useAppForm(() => ({
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: "John",
      lastName: "Doe",
    },
  }));

  return (
    // Notice the `AppField` instead of `Field`; `AppField` provides the required context
    <form.AppField
      name="firstName"
      children={(field) => <field.TextField label="First Name" />}
    />
  );
}
```

This not only allows you to reuse the UI of your shared component, but retains the type-safety you'd expect from TanStack Form: Typo `name` and get a TypeScript error.

### Pre-bound Form Components

While `form.AppField` solves many of the problems with Field boilerplate and reusability, it doesn't solve the problem of _form_ boilerplate and reusability.

In particular, being able to share instances of `form.Subscribe` for, say, a reactive form submission button is a common usecase.

```tsx
function SubscribeButton(props: { label: string }) {
  const form = useFormContext();
  return (
    <form.Subscribe selector={(state) => state.isSubmitting}>
      {(isSubmitting) => (
        <button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting()}>
          {props.label}
        </button>
      )}
    </form.Subscribe>
  );
}

const { useAppForm, withForm } = createFormHook({
  fieldComponents: {},
  formComponents: {
    SubscribeButton,
  },
  fieldContext,
  formContext,
});

function App() {
  const form = useAppForm(() => ({
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: "John",
      lastName: "Doe",
    },
  }));

  return (
    <form.AppForm>
      // Notice the `AppForm` component wrapper; `AppForm` provides the required context
      <form.SubscribeButton label="Submit" />
    </form.AppForm>
  );
}
```

## Breaking big forms into smaller pieces

Sometimes forms get very large; it's just how it goes sometimes. While TanStack Form supports large forms well, it's never fun to work with hundreds or thousands of lines of code long files.

To solve this, we support breaking forms into smaller pieces using the `withForm` higher-order component.

```tsx
const { useAppForm, withForm } = createFormHook({
  fieldComponents: {
    TextField,
  },
  formComponents: {
    SubscribeButton,
  },
  fieldContext,
  formContext,
});

const ChildForm = withForm({
  // These values are only used for type-checking, and are not used at runtime
  // This allows you to `...formOpts` from `formOptions` without needing to redeclare the options
  defaultValues: {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
  },
  // Optional, but adds props to the `render` function in addition to `form`
  props: {
    // These props are also set as default values for the `render` function
    title: "Child Form",
  },
  render: function Render(props) {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{props.title}</p>
        <props.form.AppField
          name="firstName"
          children={(field) => <field.TextField label="First Name" />}
        />
        <props.form.AppForm>
          <props.form.SubscribeButton label="Submit" />
        </props.form.AppForm>
      </div>
    );
  },
});

function App() {
  const form = useAppForm(() => ({
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: "John",
      lastName: "Doe",
    },
  }));

  return <ChildForm form={form} title={"Testing"} />;
}
```

### `withForm` FAQ

> Why a higher-order component instead of a hook?

While hooks are the future of Solid, higher-order components are still a powerful tool for composition. In particular, the API of `withForm` enables us to have strong type-safety without requiring users to pass generics.

## Tree-shaking form and field components

While the above examples are great for getting started, they're not ideal for certain use-cases where you might have hundreds of form and field components.
In particular, you may not want to include all of your form and field components in the bundle of every file that uses your form hook.

To solve this, you can mix the `createFormHook` TanStack API with the Solid `lazy` and `Suspense` components:

```typescript
// src/hooks/form-context.ts
import { createFormHookContexts } from "@tanstack/solid-form";

export const { fieldContext, useFieldContext, formContext, useFormContext } =
  createFormHookContexts();
```

```tsx
// src/components/text-field.tsx
import { useFieldContext } from "../hooks/form-context.tsx";

export default function TextField(props: { label: string }) {
  const field = useFieldContext<string>();

  return (
    <label>
      <div>{props.label}</div>
      <input
        value={field().state.value}
        onChange={(e) => field().handleChange(e.target.value)}
      />
    </label>
  );
}
```

```tsx
// src/hooks/form.ts
import { lazy } from "solid-js";
import { createFormHook } from "@tanstack/solid-form";

const TextField = lazy(() => import("../components/text-fields.tsx"));

const { useAppForm, withForm } = createFormHook({
  fieldContext,
  formContext,
  fieldComponents: {
    TextField,
  },
  formComponents: {},
});
```

```tsx
// src/App.tsx
import { Suspense } from "solid-js";
import { PeoplePage } from "./features/people/form.tsx";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
      <PeoplePage />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

This will show the Suspense fallback while the `TextField` component is being loaded, and then render the form once it's loaded.

## Putting it all together

Now that we've covered the basics of creating custom form hooks, let's put it all together in a single example.

```tsx
// /src/hooks/form.ts, to be used across the entire app
const { fieldContext, useFieldContext, formContext, useFormContext } =
  createFormHookContexts();

function TextField(props: { label: string }) {
  const field = useFieldContext<string>();
  return (
    <label>
      <div>{props.label}</div>
      <input
        value={field().state.value}
        onChange={(e) => field().handleChange(e.target.value)}
      />
    </label>
  );
}

function SubscribeButton(props: { label: string }) {
  const form = useFormContext();
  return (
    <form.Subscribe selector={(state) => state.isSubmitting}>
      {(isSubmitting) => <button disabled={isSubmitting()}>{props.label}</button>}
    </form.Subscribe>
  );
}

const { useAppForm, withForm } = createFormHook({
  fieldComponents: {
    TextField,
  },
  formComponents: {
    SubscribeButton,
  },
  fieldContext,
  formContext,
});

// /src/features/people/shared-form.ts, to be used across `people` features
const formOpts = formOptions({
  defaultValues: {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
  },
});

// /src/features/people/nested-form.ts, to be used in the `people` page
const ChildForm = withForm({
  ...formOpts,
  // Optional, but adds props to the `render` function outside of `form`
  props: {
    title: "Child Form",
  },
  render: (props) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{title}</p>
        <props.form.AppField
          name="firstName"
          children={(field) => <field.TextField label="First Name" />}
        />
        <props.form.AppForm>
          <props.form.SubscribeButton label="Submit" />
        </props.form.AppForm>
      </div>
    );
  },
});

// /src/features/people/page.ts
const Parent = () => {
  const form = useAppForm({
    ...formOpts,
  });

  return <ChildForm form={form} title={"Testing"} />;
};
```

## API Usage Guidance

Here's a chart to help you decide what APIs you should be using:

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/solid/guides/linked-fields.md">

id: linked-fields
title: Link Two Form Fields Together
---

You may find yourself needing to link two fields together; when one is validated as another field's value has changed.
One such usage is when you have both a `password` and `confirm_password` field,
where you want to `confirm_password` to error out when `password`'s value does not match;
regardless of which field triggered the value change.

Imagine the following userflow:

- User updates confirm password field.
- User updates the non-confirm password field.

In this example, the form will still have errors present,
as the "confirm password" field validation has not been re-ran to mark as accepted.

To solve this, we need to make sure that the "confirm password" validation is re-run when the password field is updated.
To do this, you can add a `onChangeListenTo` property to the `confirm_password` field.

```tsx
export default function App() {
  const form = createForm(() => ({
    defaultValues: {
      password: "",
      confirm_password: "",
    },
    // ...
  }));

  return (
    <div>
      <form.Field name="password">
        {(field) => (
          <label>
            <div>Password</div>
            <input
              value={field().state.value}
              onChange={(e) => field().handleChange(e.target.value)}
            />
          </label>
        )}
      </form.Field>
      <form.Field
        name="confirm_password"
        validators={{
          onChangeListenTo: ["password"],
          onChange: ({ value, fieldApi }) => {
            if (value !== fieldApi.form.getFieldValue("password")) {
              return "Passwords do not match";
            }
            return undefined;
          },
        }}
      >
        {(field) => (
          <div>
            <label>
              <div>Confirm Password</div>
              <input
                value={field().state.value}
                onChange={(e) => field().handleChange(e.target.value)}
              />
            </label>
            <Index each={field().state.meta.errors}>{(err) => <div>{err()}</div>}</Index>
          </div>
        )}
      </form.Field>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This similarly works with `onBlurListenTo` property, which will re-run the validation when the field is blurred.

title: Submission handling

## Passing additional data to submission handling

You may have multiple types of submission behaviour, for example, going back to another page or staying on the form.
You can accomplish this by specifying the `onSubmitMeta` property. This meta data will be passed to the `onSubmit` function.

> Note: if `form.handleSubmit()` is called without metadata, it will use the provided default.

```tsx
import { createForm } from "@tanstack/solid-form";

type FormMeta = {
  submitAction: "continue" | "backToMenu" | null;
};

// Metadata is not required to call form.handleSubmit().
// Specify what values to use as default if no meta is passed
const defaultMeta: FormMeta = {
  submitAction: null,
};

export default function App() {
  const form = createForm(() => ({
    defaultValues: {
      data: "",
    },
    // Define what meta values to expect on submission
    onSubmitMeta: defaultMeta,
    onSubmit: async ({ value, meta }) => {
      // Do something with the values passed via handleSubmit
      console.log(`Selected action - ${meta.submitAction}`, value);
    },
  }));

  return (
    <form
      onSubmit={(e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        e.stopPropagation();
      }}
    >
      {/* ... */}
      <button
        type="submit"
        // Overwrites the default specified in onSubmitMeta
        onClick={() => form.handleSubmit({ submitAction: "continue" })}
      >
        Submit and continue
      </button>
      <button
        type="submit"
        onClick={() => form.handleSubmit({ submitAction: "backToMenu" })}
      >
        Submit and back to menu
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

## Transforming data with Standard Schemas

While Tanstack Form provides [Standard Schema support](../validation.md) for validation, it does not preserve the Schema's output data.

The value passed to the `onSubmit` function will always be the input data. To receive the output data of a Standard Schema, parse it in the `onSubmit` function:

```tsx
import { createForm } from "@tanstack/solid-form";
import { z } from "zod";

// ...

const schema = z.object({
  age: z.string().transform((age) => Number(age)),
});

// Tanstack Form uses the input type of Standard Schemas
const defaultValues: z.input<typeof schema> = {
  age: "13",
};

const form = createForm(() => ({
  defaultValues,
  validators: {
    onChange: schema,
  },
  onSubmit: ({ value }) => {
    const inputAge: string = value.age;
    // Pass it through the schema to get the transformed value
    const result = schema.parse(value);
    const outputAge: number = result.age;
  },
}));
```
</file>

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/solid/guides/validation.md">
---
id: form-validation
title: Form and Field Validation
---

At the core of TanStack Form's functionalities is the concept of validation. TanStack Form makes validation highly customizable:

- You can control when to perform the validation (on change, on input, on blur, on submit...)
- Validation rules can be defined at the field level or at the form level
- Validation can be synchronous or asynchronous (for example, as a result of an API call)

## When is validation performed?

It's up to you! The `<Field />` component accepts some callbacks as props such as `onChange` or `onBlur`. Those callbacks are passed the current value of the field, as well as the fieldAPI object, so that you can perform the validation. If you find a validation error, simply return the error message as string and it will be available in `field().state.meta.errors`.

Here is an example:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) =>
      value < 13 ? "You must be 13 to make an account" : undefined,
  }}
>
  {(field) => (
    <>
      <label for={field().name}>Age:</label>
      <input
        id={field().name}
        name={field().name}
        value={field().state.value}
        type="number"
        onInput={(e) => field().handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
      />
      {!field().state.meta.isValid ? (
        <em role="alert">{field().state.meta.errors.join(", ")}</em>
      ) : null}
    </>
  )}
</form.Field>
```

In the example above, the validation is done at each keystroke (`onChange`). If, instead, we wanted the validation to be done when the field is blurred, we would change the code above like so:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) =>
      value < 13 ? "You must be 13 to make an account" : undefined,
  }}
>
  {(field) => (
    <>
      <label for={field().name}>Age:</label>
      <input
        id={field().name}
        name={field().name}
        value={field().state.value}
        type="number"
        // Listen to the onBlur event on the field
        onBlur={field().handleBlur}
        // We always need to implement onInput, so that TanStack Form receives the changes
        onInput={(e) => field().handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
      />
      {!field().state.meta.isValid ? (
        <em role="alert">{field().state.meta.errors.join(", ")}</em>
      ) : null}
    </>
  )}
</form.Field>
```

So you can control when the validation is done by implementing the desired callback. You can even perform different pieces of validation at different times:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) =>
      value < 13 ? "You must be 13 to make an account" : undefined,
    onBlur: ({ value }) => (value < 0 ? "Invalid value" : undefined),
  }}
>
  {(field) => (
    <>
      <label for={field().name}>Age:</label>
      <input
        id={field().name}
        name={field().name}
        value={field().state.value}
        type="number"
        // Listen to the onBlur event on the field
        onBlur={field().handleBlur}
        // We always need to implement onInput, so that TanStack Form receives the changes
        onInput={(e) => field().handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
      />
      {!field().state.meta.isValid ? (
        <em role="alert">{field().state.meta.errors.join(", ")}</em>
      ) : null}
    </>
  )}
</form.Field>
```

In the example above, we are validating different things on the same field at different times (at each keystroke and when blurring the field). Since `field().state.meta.errors` is an array, all the relevant errors at a given time are displayed. You can also use `field().state.meta.errorMap` to get errors based on _when_ the validation was done (onChange, onBlur etc...). More info about displaying errors below.

## Displaying Errors

Once you have your validation in place, you can map the errors from an array to be displayed in your UI:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) =>
      value < 13 ? "You must be 13 to make an account" : undefined,
  }}
>
  {(field) => {
    return (
      <>
        {/* ... */}
        {!field().state.meta.isValid ? (
          <em>{field().state.meta.errors.join(",")}</em>
        ) : null}
      </>
    );
  }}
</form.Field>
```

Or use the `errorMap` property to access the specific error you're looking for:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) =>
      value < 13 ? "You must be 13 to make an account" : undefined,
  }}
>
  {(field) => (
    <>
      {/* ... */}
      {field().state.meta.errorMap["onChange"] ? (
        <em>{field().state.meta.errorMap["onChange"]}</em>
      ) : null}
    </>
  )}
</form.Field>
```

It's worth mentioning that our `errors` array and the `errorMap` matches the types returned by the validators. This means that:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) => (value < 13 ? { isOldEnough: false } : undefined),
  }}
>
  {(field) => (
    <>
      {/* ... */}
      {/* errorMap.onChange is type `{isOldEnough: false} | undefined` */}
      {/* meta.errors is type `Array<{isOldEnough: false} | undefined>` */}
      {!field().state.meta.errorMap["onChange"]?.isOldEnough ? (
        <em>The user is not old enough</em>
      ) : null}
    </>
  )}
</form.Field>
```

## Validation at field level vs at form level

As shown above, each `<Field>` accepts its own validation rules via the `onChange`, `onBlur` etc... callbacks. It is also possible to define validation rules at the form level (as opposed to field by field) by passing similar callbacks to the `createForm()` hook.

Example:

```tsx
export default function App() {
  const form = createForm(() => ({
    defaultValues: {
      age: 0,
    },
    onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
      console.log(value);
    },
    validators: {
      // Add validators to the form the same way you would add them to a field
      onChange({ value }) {
        if (value.age < 13) {
          return "Must be 13 or older to sign";
        }
        return undefined;
      },
    },
  }));

  // Subscribe to the form's error map so that updates to it will render
  // alternately, you can use `form.Subscribe`
  const formErrorMap = form.useStore((state) => state.errorMap);

  return (
    <div>
      {/* ... */}
      {formErrorMap().onChange ? (
        <div>
          <em>There was an error on the form: {formErrorMap().onChange}</em>
        </div>
      ) : null}
      {/* ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Setting field-level errors from the form's validators

You can set errors on the fields from the form's validators. One common use case for this is validating all the fields on submit by calling a single API endpoint in the form's `onSubmitAsync` validator.

```tsx
import { Show } from "solid-js";
import { createForm } from "@tanstack/solid-form";

export default function App() {
  const form = createForm(() => ({
    defaultValues: {
      age: 0,
      socials: [],
      details: {
        email: "",
      },
    },
    validators: {
      onSubmitAsync: async ({ value }) => {
        // Validate the value on the server
        const hasErrors = await validateDataOnServer(value);
        if (hasErrors) {
          return {
            form: "Invalid data", // The `form` key is optional
            fields: {
              age: "Must be 13 or older to sign",
              // Set errors on nested fields with the field's name
              "socials[0].url": "The provided URL does not exist",
              "details.email": "An email is required",
            },
          };
        }

        return null;
      },
    },
  }));

  return (
    <div>
      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          e.stopPropagation();
          void form.handleSubmit();
        }}
      >
        <form.Field
          name="age"
          children={(field) => (
            <>
              <label for={field().name}>Age:</label>
              <input

## Asynchronous Functional Validation

While we suspect most validations will be synchronous, there are many instances where a network call or some other async operation would be useful to validate against.

To do this, we have dedicated `onChangeAsync`, `onBlurAsync`, and other methods that can be used to validate against:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChangeAsync: async ({ value }) => {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
      return value < 13 ? "You must be 13 to make an account" : undefined;
    },
  }}
>
  {(field) => (
    <>
      <label for={field().name}>Age:</label>
      <input
        id={field().name}
        name={field().name}
        value={field().state.value}
        type="number"
        onInput={(e) => field().handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
      />
      {!field().state.meta.isValid ? (
        <em role="alert">{field().state.meta.errors.join(", ")}</em>
      ) : null}
    </>
  )}
</form.Field>
```

Synchronous and Asynchronous validations can coexist. For example, it is possible to define both `onBlur` and `onBlurAsync` on the same field:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onBlur: ({ value }) => (value < 13 ? "You must be at least 13" : undefined),
    onBlurAsync: async ({ value }) => {
      const currentAge = await fetchCurrentAgeOnProfile();
      return value < currentAge ? "You can only increase the age" : undefined;
    },
  }}
>
  {(field) => (
    <>
      <label for={field().name}>Age:</label>
      <input
        id={field().name}
        name={field().name}
        value={field().state.value}
        type="number"
        onBlur={field().handleBlur}
        onInput={(e) => field().handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
      />
      {field().state.meta.errors ? (
        <em role="alert">{field().state.meta.errors.join(", ")}</em>
      ) : null}
    </>
  )}
</form.Field>
```

The synchronous validation method (`onBlur`) is run first and the asynchronous method (`onBlurAsync`) is only run if the synchronous one (`onBlur`) succeeds. To change this behaviour, set the `asyncAlways` option to `true`, and the async method will be run regardless of the result of the sync method.

### Built-in Debouncing

While async calls are the way to go when validating against the database, running a network request on every keystroke is a good way to DDOS your database.

Instead, we enable an easy method for debouncing your `async` calls by adding a single property:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  asyncDebounceMs={500}
  validators={{
    onChangeAsync: async ({ value }) => {
      // ...
    },
  }}
  children={(field) => {
    return <>{/* ... */}</>;
  }}
/>
```

This will debounce every async call with a 500ms delay. You can even override this property on a per-validation property:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  asyncDebounceMs={500}
  validators={{
    onChangeAsyncDebounceMs: 1500,
    onChangeAsync: async ({ value }) => {
      // ...
    },
    onBlurAsync: async ({ value }) => {
      // ...
    },
  }}
  children={(field) => {
    return <>{/* ... */}</>;
  }}
/>
```

This will run `onChangeAsync` every 1500ms while `onBlurAsync` will run every 500ms.

## Validation through Schema Libraries

While functions provide more flexibility and customization over your validation, they can be a bit verbose. To help solve this, there are libraries that provide schema-based validation to make shorthand and type-strict validation substantially easier. You can also define a single schema for your entire form and pass it to the form level, errors will be automatically propagated to the fields.

### Standard Schema Libraries

TanStack Form natively supports all libraries following the [Standard Schema specification](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema), most notably:

- [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/)
- [ArkType](https://arktype.io/)

_Note:_ make sure to use the latest version of the schema libraries as older versions might not support Standard Schema yet.

> Validation will not provide you with transformed values. See [submission handling](../submission-handling.md) for more information.

To use schemas from these libraries you can pass them to the `validators` props as you would do with a custom function:

```tsx
import { z } from "zod";

// ...

const form = createForm(() => ({
  // ...
}));

<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: z.number().gte(13, "You must be 13 to make an account"),
  }}
  children={(field) => {
    return <>{/* ... */}</>;
  }}
/>;
```

Async validations on form and field level are supported as well:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: z.number().gte(13, "You must be 13 to make an account"),
    onChangeAsyncDebounceMs: 500,
    onChangeAsync: z.number().refine(
      async (value) => {
        const currentAge = await fetchCurrentAgeOnProfile();
        return value >= currentAge;
      },
      {
        message: "You can only increase the age",
      },
    ),
  }}
  children={(field) => {
    return <>{/* ... */}</>;
  }}
/>
```

If you need even more control over your Standard Schema validation, you can combine a Standard Schema with a callback function like so:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value, fieldApi }) => {
      const errors = fieldApi.parseValueWithSchema(
        z.number().gte(13, "You must be 13 to make an account"),
      );

      if (errors) return errors;

      // continue with your validation
    },
  }}
  children={(field) => {
    return <>{/* ... */}</>;
  }}
/>
```

## Preventing invalid forms from being submitted

The `onChange`, `onBlur` etc... callbacks are also run when the form is submitted and the submission is blocked if the form is invalid.

The form state object has a `canSubmit` flag that is false when any field is invalid and the form has been touched (`canSubmit` is true until the form has been touched, even if some fields are "technically" invalid based on their `onChange`/`onBlur` props).

You can subscribe to it via `form.Subscribe` and use the value in order to, for example, disable the submit button when the form is invalid (in practice, disabled buttons are not accessible, use `aria-disabled` instead).

```tsx
const form = createForm(() => ({
  /* ... */
}));

return (
  /* ... */

  // Dynamic submit button
  <form.Subscribe
    selector={(state) => ({
      canSubmit: state.canSubmit,
      isSubmitting: state.isSubmitting,
    })}
    children={(state) => (
      <button type="submit" disabled={!state().canSubmit}>
        {state().isSubmitting ? "..." : "Submit"}
      </button>
    )}
  />
);
```

The bare minimum to get started with TanStack Form is to create a form and add a field. Keep in mind that this example does not include any validation or error handling... yet.

```tsx
import { createForm } from "@tanstack/solid-form";

function App() {
  const form = createForm(() => ({
    defaultValues: {
      fullName: "",
    },
    onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
      // Do something with form data
      console.log(value);
    },
  }));

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Simple Form Example</h1>
      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          e.stopPropagation();
          form.handleSubmit();
        }}
      >
        <div>
          <form.Field
            name="fullName"
            children={(field) => (
              <input
                name={field().name}
                value={field().state.value}
                onBlur={field().handleBlur}
                onInput={(e) => field().handleChange(e.target.value)}
              />
            )}
          />
        </div>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

From here, you'll be ready to explore all of the other features of TanStack Form!

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/svelte/guides/arrays.md">
---
id: arrays
title: Arrays
---

TanStack Form supports arrays as values in a form, including sub-object values inside of an array.

## Basic Usage

To use an array, you can use `field.state.value` on an array value in conjunction
with [`each blocks`](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/each):

```svelte
<script>
  import { createForm } from '@tanstack/svelte-form'

  const form = createForm(() => ({
    defaultValues: {
      people: [],
    },
  }))
</script>

<form.Field name="people" mode="array">
  {#snippet children(field)}
    {#each field.state.value as person, i}
      <!-- ... -->
    {/each}
  {/snippet}
</form.Field>
```

This will regenerate the list every time you run `pushValue` on `field`:

```svelte
<button onclick={() => field.pushValue({ name: '', age: 0 })} type="button">
  Add person
</button>
```

Finally, you can use a subfield like so:

```svelte
<form.Field name={`people[${i}].name`}>
  {#snippet children(subField)}
    <input
      value={subField.state.value}
      oninput={(e) => {
        subField.handleChange(e.currentTarget.value)
      }}
    />
  {/snippet}
</form.Field>
```

## Full Example

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  import { createForm } from '@tanstack/svelte-form'

  const form = createForm(() => ({
    defaultValues: {
      people: [] as Array<{ age: number; name: string }>,
    },
    onSubmit: ({ value }) => alert(JSON.stringify(value)),
  }))
</script>

<form
  id="form"
  onsubmit={(e) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    e.stopPropagation()
    form.handleSubmit()
  }}
>
  <form.Field name="people">
    {#snippet children(field)}
      <div>
        {#each field.state.value as person, i}
          <form.Field name={`people[${i}].name`}>
            {#snippet children(subField)}
              <div>
                <label>
                  <div>Name for person {i}</div>
                  <input
                    value={person.name}
                    oninput={(e: Event) => {
                      const target = e.target as HTMLInputElement
                      subField.handleChange(target.value)
                    }}
                  />
                </label>
              </div>
            {/snippet}
          </form.Field>
        {/each}

        <button
          onclick={() => field.pushValue({ name: '', age: 0 })}
          type="button"
        >
          Add person

id: async-initial-values
title: Async Initial Values
---

Let's say that you want to fetch some data from an API and use it as the initial value of a form.

While this problem sounds simple on the surface, there are hidden complexities you might not have thought of thus far.

For example, you might want to show a loading spinner while the data is being fetched, or you might want to handle errors gracefully.
Likewise, you could also find yourself looking for a way to cache the data so that you don't have to fetch it every time the form is rendered.

While we could implement many of these features from scratch, it would end up looking a lot like another project we maintain: [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query).

As such, this guide shows you how you can mix-n-match TanStack Form with TanStack Query to achieve the desired behavior.

## Basic Usage

```svelte
<script>
  import { createForm } from '@tanstack/svelte-form'
  import { createQuery } from '@tanstack/svelte-query'

    const { data, isLoading } = createQuery(() => ({
      queryKey: ['data'],
      queryFn: async () => {
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
        return { firstName: 'FirstName', lastName: 'LastName' }
      },
    }))

    const form = createForm(() => ({
      defaultValues: {
        firstName: $data?.firstName ?? '',
        lastName: $data?.lastName ?? '',
      },
      onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
        // Do something with form data
        console.log(value)
      },
    }))
</script>

{#if $isLoading}
  <p>Loading...</p>
{:else}
  <!-- form... -->
{/if}
```

This will show a loading spinner until the data is fetched, and then it will render the form with the fetched data as the initial values.

title: Basic Concepts and Terminology
---

This page introduces the basic concepts and terminology used in the `@tanstack/svelte-form` library. Familiarizing yourself with these concepts will help you better understand and work with the library.

## Form Options

You can create options for your form so that it can be shared between multiple forms by using the `formOptions` function.

Example:

```ts
const formOpts = formOptions({
  defaultValues: {
    firstName: "",
    lastName: "",
    hobbies: [],
  } as Person,
});
```

## Form Instance

A Form Instance is an object that represents an individual form and provides methods and properties for working with the form. You create a form instance using the `createForm` function. The function accepts an object with an `onSubmit` function, which is called when the form is submitted.

```ts
const form = createForm(() => ({
  ...formOpts,
  onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
    // Do something with form data
    console.log(value);
  },
}));
```

You may also create a form instance without using `formOptions`:

```ts
const form = createForm<Person>(() => ({
  onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
    // Do something with form data
    console.log(value);
  },
  defaultValues: {
    firstName: "",
    lastName: "",
    hobbies: [],
  },
}));
```

## Field

A Field represents a single form input element, such as a text input or a checkbox. Fields are created using the `form.Field` component provided by the form instance. The component accepts a name prop, which should match a key in the form's default values. It also accepts a children prop, which is a render prop function that takes a field object as its argument.

Example:

```svelte
<form.Field name="firstName">
  {#snippet children(field)}
    <input
      name={field.name}
      value={field.state.value}
      onblur={field.handleBlur}
      oninput={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
    />
  {/snippet}
</form.Field>
```

## Field State

Each field has its own state, which includes its current value, validation status, error messages, and other metadata. You can access a field's state using the `field.state` property.

Example:

```ts
const {
  value,
  meta: { errors, isValidating },
} = field.state;
```

There are four states in the metadata that can be useful to see how the user interacts with a field:

- _"isTouched"_, after the user changes the field or blurs the field
- _"isDirty"_, after the field's value has been changed, even if it's been reverted to the default. Opposite of `isPristine`
- _"isPristine"_, until the user changes the field value. Opposite of `isDirty`
- _"isBlurred"_, after the field has been blurred

```ts
const { isTouched, isDirty, isPristine, isBlurred } = field.state.meta;
```

![Field states](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TanStack/form/main/docs/assets/field-states.png)

## Understanding 'isDirty' in Different Libraries

Non-Persistent `dirty` state

- **Libraries**: React Hook Form (RHF), Formik, Final Form.
- **Behavior**: A field is 'dirty' if its value differs from the default. Reverting to the default value makes it 'clean' again.

Persistent `dirty` state

- **Libraries**: Angular Form, Vue FormKit.
- **Behavior**: A field remains 'dirty' once changed, even if reverted to the default value.

We have chosen the persistent 'dirty' state model. To also support a non-persistent 'dirty' state, we introduce an additional flag:

- _"isDefaultValue"_, whether the field's current value is the default value

```ts
const { isDefaultValue, isTouched } = field.state.meta;

// The following line will re-create the non-Persistent `dirty` functionality.
const nonPersistentIsDirty = !isDefaultValue;
```

![Field states extended](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TanStack/form/main/docs/assets/field-states-extended.png)

## Field API

The Field API is an object passed to the render prop function when creating a field. It provides methods for working with the field's state.

Example:

```svelte
<input
  name={field.name}
  value={field.state.value}
  onblur={field.handleBlur}
  oninput={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
/>
```

## Validation

`@tanstack/svelte-form` provides both synchronous and asynchronous validation out of the box. Validation functions can be passed to the `form.Field` component using the `validators` prop.

Example:

```svelte
<form.Field
  name="firstName"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) =>
      !value
        ? 'A first name is required'
        : value.length < 3
          ? 'First name must be at least 3 characters'
          : undefined,
    onChangeAsync: async ({ value }) => {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
      return value.includes('error') && 'No "error" allowed in first name'
    },
  }}
>
  {#snippet children(field)}
    <input
      name={field.name}
      value={field.state.value}
      onBlur={field.handleBlur}
      onInput={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
    />
    <p>{field.state.meta.errors[0]}</p>
  {/snippet}
</form.Field>
```

## Validation with Standard Schema Libraries

In addition to hand-rolled validation options, we also support the [Standard Schema](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema) specification.

You can define a schema using any of the libraries implementing the specification and pass it to a form or field validator.

Supported libraries include:

- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) (v3.24.0 or higher)
- [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/) (v1.0.0 or higher)
- [ArkType](https://arktype.io/) (v2.1.20 or higher)
- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) (v1.7.0 or higher)

```svelte
<script>
  import { z } from 'zod'

  // ...
</script>

<form.Field
  name="firstName"
  validators={{
    onChange: z.string().min(3, 'First name must be at least 3 characters'),
    onChangeAsyncDebounceMs: 500,
    onChangeAsync: z.string().refine(
      async (value) => {
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
        return !value.includes('error')
      },
      {
        message: 'No "error" allowed in first name',
      },
    ),
  }}
>
  {#snippet children(field)}
    <input
      name={field.name}
      value={field.state.value}
      onBlur={field.handleBlur}
      onInput={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
    />
    <p>{field.state.meta.errors[0]}</p>
  {/snippet}
</form.Field>
```

## Reactivity

`@tanstack/svelte-form` offers various ways to subscribe to form and field state changes, most notably the `form.useStore` hook and the `form.Subscribe` component. These methods allow you to optimize your form's rendering performance by only updating components when necessary.

Example:

```svelte
<script>
  //...
  const firstName = form.useStore((state) => state.values.firstName)
</script>

<form.Subscribe
  selector={(state) => ({
    canSubmit: state.canSubmit,
    isSubmitting: state.isSubmitting,
  })}
>
  {#snippet children(state)}
    <button type="submit" disabled={!state.canSubmit}>
      {state.isSubmitting ? '...' : 'Submit'}
    </button>
  {/snippet}
</form.Subscribe>
```

## Array Fields

Array fields allow you to manage a list of values within a form, such as a list of hobbies. You can create an array field using the `form.Field` component with the `mode="array"` prop.

When working with array fields, you can use the fields `pushValue`, `removeValue`, `swapValues` and `moveValue` methods to add, remove, and swap values in the array.

Example:

```svelte
<form.Field name="hobbies" mode="array">
  {#snippet children(hobbiesField)}
    <div>
      Hobbies
      <div>
        {#each hobbiesField.state.value as _, i}
            <div>
              <form.Field name={`hobbies[${i}].name`}>
                {#snippet children(field)}
                  <div>
                    <label for={field.name}>Name:</label>
                    <input
                      id={field.name}
                      name={field.name}
                      value={field.state.value}
                      onblur={field.handleBlur}
                      onchange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
                    />
                    <button
                      type="button"
                      onclick={() => hobbiesField.removeValue(i)}
                    >
                      X
                    </button>
                  </div>
                {/snippet}
              </form.Field>
              <form.Field name={`hobbies[${i}].description`}>
                {#snippet children(field)}
                    <div>
                      <label for={field.name}>Description:</label>
                      <input
                        id={field.name}
                        name={field.name}
                        value={field.state.value}
                        onblur={field.handleBlur}
                        onchange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
                      />
                    </div>
                {/snippet}
              </form.Field>
            </div>
          {:else}
            No hobbies found.
          {/each}
      </div>
      <button
        type="button"
        onclick={() =>
          hobbiesField.pushValue({
            name: '',
            description: '',
            yearsOfExperience: 0,
          })
        }
      >
        Add hobby
      </button>
    </div>
  {/snippet}
</form.Field>
```

These are the basic concepts and terminology used in the `@tanstack/svelte-form` library. Understanding these concepts will help you work more effectively with the library and create complex forms with ease.

id: linked-fields
title: Link Two Form Fields Together
---

You may find yourself needing to link two fields together; when one is validated as another field's value has changed.
One such usage is when you have both a `password` and `confirm_password` field,
where you want to `confirm_password` to error out when `password`'s value does not match;
regardless of which field triggered the value change.

Imagine the following userflow:

- User updates confirm password field.
- User updates the non-confirm password field.

In this example, the form will still have errors present,
as the "confirm password" field validation has not been re-ran to mark as accepted.

To solve this, we need to make sure that the "confirm password" validation is re-run when the password field is updated.
To do this, you can add a `onChangeListenTo` property to the `confirm_password` field.

```svelte
<script>
  import { createForm } from '@tanstack/svelte-form'

  const form = createForm(() => ({
    defaultValues: {
      password: '',
      confirm_password: '',
    },
    // ...
  }))
</script>

<div>
  <form.Field name="password">
    {#snippet children(field)}
      <label>
        <div>Password</div>
        <input
          value={field.state.value}
          onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
    {/snippet}
  </form.Field>
  <form.Field
    name="confirm_password"
    validators={{
      onChangeListenTo: ['password'],
      onChange: ({ value, fieldApi }) => {
        if (value !== fieldApi.form.getFieldValue('password')) {
          return 'Passwords do not match'
        }
        return undefined
      },
    }}
  >
    {#snippet children(field)}
      <div>
        <label>
          <div>Confirm Password</div>
          <input
            value={field.state.value}
            onchange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
          />
        </label>
        {#each field.state.meta.errors as err}
          <div>{err}</div>
        {/each}
      </div>
    {/snippet}
  </form.Field>
</div>
```

This similarly works with `onBlurListenTo` property, which will re-run the validation when the field is blurred.

id: form-validation
title: Form and Field Validation
---

At the core of TanStack Form's functionalities is the concept of validation. TanStack Form makes validation highly customizable:

- You can control when to perform the validation (on change, on input, on blur, on submit...)
- Validation rules can be defined at the field level or at the form level
- Validation can be synchronous or asynchronous (for example, as a result of an API call)

## When is validation performed?

It's up to you! The `<form.Field />` component accepts some callbacks as props such as `onChange` or `onBlur`. Those callbacks are passed the current value of the field, as well as the fieldAPI object, so that you can perform the validation. If you find a validation error, simply return the error message as string and it will be available in `field.state.meta.errors`.

Here is an example:

```svelte
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) =>
      value < 13 ? 'You must be 13 to make an account' : undefined,
  }}
>
  {#snippet children(field)}
    <label for={field.name}>Age:</label>
    <input
      id={field.name}
      name={field.name}
      value={field.state.value}
      type="number"
      onchange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
    />
    {#if field.state.meta.errors}
      <em role="alert">{field.state.meta.errors.join(', ')}</em>
    {/if}
  {/snippet}
</form.Field>
```

In the example above, the validation is done at each keystroke (`onchange`). If, instead, we wanted the validation to be done when the field is blurred, we would change the code above like so:

```svelte
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onBlur: ({ value }) =>
      value < 13 ? 'You must be 13 to make an account' : undefined,
  }}
>
  {#snippet children(field)}
    <label for={field.name}>Age:</label>
    <input
      id={field.name}
      name={field.name}
      value={field.state.value}
      type="number"
      onblur={field.handleBlur}
      onchange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
    />
    {#if field.state.meta.errors}
      <em role="alert">{field.state.meta.errors.join(', ')}</em>
    {/if}
  {/snippet}
</form.Field>
```

So you can control when the validation is done by implementing the desired callback. You can even perform different pieces of validation at different times:

```svelte
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) =>
      value < 13 ? 'You must be 13 to make an account' : undefined,
    onBlur: ({ value }) => (value < 0 ? 'Invalid value' : undefined),
  }}
>
  {#snippet children(field)}
    <label for={field.name}>Age:</label>
    <input
      id={field.name}
      name={field.name}
      value={field.state.value}
      type="number"
      onblur={field.handleBlur}
      onchange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
    />
    {#if field.state.meta.errors}
      <em role="alert">{field.state.meta.errors.join(', ')}</em>
    {/if}
  {/snippet}
</form.Field>
```

In the example above, we are validating different things on the same field at different times (at each keystroke and when blurring the field). Since `field.state.meta.errors` is an array, all the relevant errors at a given time are displayed. You can also use `field.state.meta.errorMap` to get errors based on _when_ the validation was done (onChange, onBlur etc...). More info about displaying errors below.

## Displaying Errors

Once you have your validation in place, you can map the errors from an array to be displayed in your UI:

```svelte
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) =>
      value < 13 ? 'You must be 13 to make an account' : undefined,
  }}
>
  {#snippet children(field)}
    <!-- ... -->
    {#if field.state.meta.errors}
      <em role="alert">{field.state.meta.errors.join(', ')}</em>
    {/if}
  {/snippet}
</form.Field>
```

Or use the `errorMap` property to access the specific error you're looking for:

```svelte
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) =>
      value < 13 ? 'You must be 13 to make an account' : undefined,
  }}
>
  {#snippet children(field)}
    <!-- ... -->
    {#if field.state.meta.errorMap['onChange']}
      <em role="alert">{field.state.meta.errorMap['onChange']}</em>
    {/if}
  {/snippet}
</form.Field>
```

It's worth mentioning that our `errors` array and the `errorMap` matches the types returned by the validators. This means that:

```svelte
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) => (value < 13 ? { isOldEnough: false } : undefined),
  }}
>
  {#snippet children(field)}
    <!-- ... -->
    <!-- errorMap.onChange is type `{isOldEnough: false} | undefined` -->
    <!-- meta.errors is type `Array<{isOldEnough: false} | undefined>` -->
    {#if field.state.meta.errorMap['onChange']?.isOldEnough}
        <em>The user is not old enough</em>
    {/if}
  {/snippet}
</form.Field>
```

## Validation at field level vs at form level

As shown above, each `<form.Field>` accepts its own validation rules via the `onChange`, `onBlur` etc... callbacks. It is also possible to define validation rules at the form level (as opposed to field by field) by passing similar callbacks to the `createForm()` hook.

Example:

```svelte
<script>
  import { createForm } from '@tanstack/svelte-form'

  const form = createForm(() => ({
    defaultValues: {
      age: 0,
    },
    onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
      console.log(value)
    },
    validators: {
      // Add validators to the form the same way you would add them to a field
      onChange({ value }) {
        if (value.age < 13) {
          return 'Must be 13 or older to sign'
        }
        return undefined
      },
    },
  }))

  // Subscribe to the form's error map so that updates to it will render
  // alternately, you can use `form.Subscribe`
  const formErrorMap = form.useStore((state) => state.errorMap)
</script>

<div>
  <!-- ... -->
  {#if formErrorMap.current.onChange}
    <div>
      <em>There was an error on the form: {formErrorMap.current.onChange}</em>
    </div>
  {/if}
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

## Asynchronous Functional Validation

While we suspect most validations will be synchronous, there are many instances where a network call or some other async operation would be useful to validate against.

To do this, we have dedicated `onChangeAsync`, `onBlurAsync`, and other methods that can be used to validate against:

```svelte
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChangeAsync: async ({ value }) => {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
      return value < 13 ? 'You must be 13 to make an account' : undefined
    },
  }}
>
  {#snippet children(field)}
    <label for={field.name}>Age:</label>
    <input
      id={field.name}
      name={field.name}
      value={field.state.value}
      type="number"
      onchange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
    />
    {#if field.state.meta.errors}
      <em role="alert">{field.state.meta.errors.join(', ')}</em>
    {/if}
  {/snippet}
</form.Field>
```

Synchronous and Asynchronous validations can coexist. For example, it is possible to define both `onBlur` and `onBlurAsync` on the same field:

```svelte
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onBlur: ({ value }) => (value < 13 ? 'You must be at least 13' : undefined),
    onBlurAsync: async ({ value }) => {
      const currentAge = await fetchCurrentAgeOnProfile()
      return value < currentAge ? 'You can only increase the age' : undefined
    },
  }}
>
  {#snippet children(field)}
    <label for={field.name}>Age:</label>
    <input
      id={field.name}
      name={field.name}
      value={field.state.value}
      type="number"
      onblur={field.handleBlur}
      onchange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
    />
    {#if field.state.meta.errors}
      <em role="alert">{field.state.meta.errors.join(', ')}</em>
    {/if}
  {/snippet}
</form.Field>
```

The synchronous validation method (`onBlur`) is run first and the asynchronous method (`onBlurAsync`) is only run if the synchronous one (`onBlur`) succeeds. To change this behaviour, set the `asyncAlways` option to `true`, and the async method will be run regardless of the result of the sync method.

### Built-in Debouncing

While async calls are the way to go when validating against the database, running a network request on every keystroke is a good way to DDOS your database.

Instead, we enable an easy method for debouncing your `async` calls by adding a single property:

```svelte
<form.Field
  name="age"
  asyncDebounceMs={500}
  validators={{
    onChangeAsync: async ({ value }) => {
      // ...
    },
  }}
>
  <!-- ... -->
</form.Field>
```

This will debounce every async call with a 500ms delay. You can even override this property on a per-validation property:

```svelte
<form.Field
  name="age"
  asyncDebounceMs={500}
  validators={{
    onChangeAsyncDebounceMs: 1500,
    onChangeAsync: async ({ value }) => {
      // ...
    },
    onBlurAsync: async ({ value }) => {
      // ...
    },
  }}
>
  <!-- ... -->
</form.Field>
```

> This will run `onChangeAsync` every 1500ms while `onBlurAsync` will run every 500ms.

## Validation through Schema Libraries

While functions provide more flexibility and customization over your validation, they can be a bit verbose. To help solve this, there are libraries that provide schema-based validation to make shorthand and type-strict validation substantially easier. You can also define a single schema for your entire form and pass it to the form level, errors will be automatically propagated to the fields.

### Standard Schema Libraries

TanStack Form natively supports all libraries following the [Standard Schema specification](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema), most notably:

- [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/)
- [ArkType](https://arktype.io/)

_Note:_ make sure to use the latest version of the schema libraries as older versions might not support Standard Schema yet.

To use schemas from these libraries you can pass them to the `validators` props as you would do with a custom function:

```svelte
<script>
  import { z } from 'zod'

  // ...

  const form = createForm(() => ({
    // ...
  }))
</script>

<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: z.number().gte(13, 'You must be 13 to make an account'),
  }}
>
  <!-- ... -->
</form.Field>
```

Async validations on form and field level are supported as well:

```svelte
<form.Field
  name="age"
  validators={{
    onChange: z.number().gte(13, 'You must be 13 to make an account'),
    onChangeAsyncDebounceMs: 500,
    onChangeAsync: z.number().refine(
      async (value) => {
        const currentAge = await fetchCurrentAgeOnProfile()
        return value >= currentAge
      },
      {
        message: 'You can only increase the age',
      },
    ),
  }}
>
  <!-- ... -->
</form.Field>
```

## Preventing invalid forms from being submitted

The `onChange`, `onBlur` etc... callbacks are also run when the form is submitted and the submission is blocked if the form is invalid.

The form state object has a `canSubmit` flag that is false when any field is invalid and the form has been touched (`canSubmit` is true until the form has been touched, even if some fields are "technically" invalid based on their `onChange`/`onBlur` props).

You can subscribe to it via `form.Subscribe` and use the value in order to, for example, disable the submit button when the form is invalid (in practice, disabled buttons are not accessible, use `aria-disabled` instead).

```svelte
<script>
  import { createForm } from '@tanstack/svelte-form'

  const form = createForm(() => ({
    /* ... */
  }))
</script>

<!-- ... -->

<!-- Dynamic submit button -->
<form.Subscribe
  selector={(state) => ({
    canSubmit: state.canSubmit,
    isSubmitting: state.isSubmitting,
  })}
  children={(state) => (
    <button type="submit" disabled={!state().canSubmit}>
      {state().isSubmitting ? '...' : 'Submit'}
    </button>
  )}
>
  {#snippet children(state)}
    <button type="submit" disabled={!state.canSubmit}>
      {state.isSubmitting ? '...' : 'Submit'}
    </button>
  {/snippet}
</form.Subscribe>
```
</file>

The bare minimum to get started with TanStack Form is to create a form and add a field. Keep in mind that this example does not include any validation or error handling... yet.

```svelte
<script>
  import { createForm } from '@tanstack/svelte-form'

  const form = createForm(() => ({
    defaultValues: {
      fullName: '',
    },
    onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
      // Do something with form data
      console.log(value)
    },
  }))
</script>

<div>
  <h1>Simple Form Example</h1>
  <form
    onsubmit={(e) => {
      e.preventDefault()
      e.stopPropagation()
      form.handleSubmit()
    }}
  >
    <div>
      <form.Field name="fullName">
        {#snippet children(field)}
          <input
            name={field.name}
            value={field.state.value}
            onblur={field.handleBlur}
            oninput={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
          />
        {/snippet}
      </form.Field>
    </div>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</div>
```

From here, you'll be ready to explore all of the other features of TanStack Form!

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/vue/guides/arrays.md">

id: arrays
title: Arrays

TanStack Form supports arrays as values in a form, including sub-object values inside of an array.

## Basic Usage

To use an array, you can use `field.state.value` on an array value in conjunction
with [`Index` from `solid-js`](https://www.solidjs.com/tutorial/flow_index):

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useForm } from "@tanstack/vue-form";

const form = useForm({
  defaultValues: {
    people: [] as Array<{ age: number; name: string }>,
  },
  onSubmit: ({ value }) => alert(JSON.stringify(value)),
});
</script>

<template>
  <form.Field name="people">
    <template v-slot="{ field, state }">
      <div>
        <form.Field
          v-for="(_, i) of field.state.value"
          :key="i"
          :name="`people[${i}].name`"
        >
          <template v-slot="{ field: subField, state }">
            <!-- ... -->
          </template>
        </form.Field>
      </div>
    </template>
  </form.Field>
</template>
```

This will generate the mapped slot every time you run `pushValue` on `field`:

```vue
<button @click="field.pushValue({ name: '', age: 0 })" type="button">
  Add person
</button>
```

Finally, you can use a subfield like so:

```vue
<form.Field v-for="(_, i) of field.state.value" :key="i" :name="`people[${i}].name`">
  <template v-slot="{ field: subField, state }">
    <div>
      <label>
        <div>Name for person {{ i }}</div>
        <input
          :value="subField.state.value"
          @input="
          (e) =>
          subField.handleChange(
            (e.target as HTMLInputElement).value,
          )
          "
        />
      </label>
    </div>
  </template>
</form.Field>
```

## Full Example

<script setup lang="ts">
import { useForm } from "@tanstack/vue-form";

const form = useForm({
  defaultValues: {
    people: [] as Array<{ age: number; name: string }>,

});

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/vue/guides/async-initial-values.md">
---
id: async-initial-values
title: Async Initial Values
---

Let's say that you want to fetch some data from an API and use it as the initial value of a form.

While this problem sounds simple on the surface, there are hidden complexities you might not have thought of thus far.

For example, you might want to show a loading spinner while the data is being fetched, or you might want to handle errors gracefully.

Likewise, you could also find yourself looking for a way to cache the data so that you don't have to fetch it every time the form is rendered.

While we could implement many of these features from scratch, it would end up looking a lot like another project we maintain: [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query).

As such, this guide shows you how you can mix-n-match TanStack Form with TanStack Query to achieve the desired behavior.

## Basic Usage

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useForm } from "@tanstack/vue-form";
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/vue-query";
import { watchEffect, reactive } from "vue";

const { data, isLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["data"],
  queryFn: async () => {
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    return { firstName: "FirstName", lastName: "LastName" };
  },
});

const firstName = computed(() => data.value?.firstName || "");
const lastName = computed(() => data.value?.lastName || "");

const defaultValues = reactive({
  firstName,
  lastName,
});

const form = useForm({
  defaultValues,
  onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
    // Do something with form data
    console.log(value);
  },
});
</script>

<template>
  <p v-if="isLoading">Loading..</p>
  <form v-else @submit.prevent.stop="form.handleSubmit">
    <!-- ... -->
  </form>
</template>
```

This will show a loading text until the data is fetched, and then it will render the form with the fetched data as the initial values.

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/vue/guides/basic-concepts.md">
---
id: basic-concepts
title: Basic Concepts and Terminology
---

This page introduces the basic concepts and terminology used in the `@tanstack/vue-form` library. Familiarizing yourself with these concepts will help you better understand and work with the library.

## Form Options

You can create options for your form so that it can be shared between multiple forms by using the `formOptions` function.

Example:

```ts
const formOpts = formOptions({
  defaultValues: {
    firstName: "",
    lastName: "",
    hobbies: [],
  } as Person,
});
```

## Form Instance

A Form Instance is an object that represents an individual form and provides methods and properties for working with the form. You create a form instance using the `useForm` function. The function accepts an object with an `onSubmit` function, which is called when the form is submitted.

```js
const form = useForm({
  ...formOpts,
  onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
    // Do something with form data
    console.log(value);
  },
});
```

You may also create a form instance without using `formOptions` by using the standalone `useForm` API:

```ts
const form = useForm({
  onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
    // Do something with form data
    console.log(value);
  },
  defaultValues: {
    firstName: "",
    lastName: "",
    hobbies: [],
  } as Person,
});
```

## Field

A Field represents a single form input element, such as a text input or a checkbox. Fields are created using the form.Field component provided by the form instance. The component accepts a name prop, which should match a key in the form's default values. It also accepts a scoped slot defined by the `v-slot` directive which takes a `field` object as its argument.

Example:

```vue
<template>
  <!-- ... -->
  <form.Field name="fullName">
    <template v-slot="{ field }">
      <input
        :name="field.name"
        :value="field.state.value"
        @blur="field.handleBlur"
        @input="(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)"
      />
    </template>
  </form.Field>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
```

## Field State

Each field has its own state, which includes its current value, validation status, error messages, and other metadata. You can access a field's state using the `field().state` property.

Example:

```ts
const {
  value,
  meta: { errors, isValidating },
} = field.state;
```

There are four states in the metadata that can be useful to see how the user interacts with a field:

- _"isTouched"_, after the user changes the field or blurs the field
- _"isDirty"_, after the field's value has been changed, even if it's been reverted to the default. Opposite of `isPristine`
- _"isPristine"_, until the user changes the field value. Opposite of `isDirty`
- _"isBlurred"_, after the field has been blurred

```ts
const { isTouched, isDirty, isPristine, isBlurred } = field.state.meta;
```

![Field states](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TanStack/form/main/docs/assets/field-states.png)

## Understanding 'isDirty' in Different Libraries

Non-Persistent `dirty` state

- **Libraries**: React Hook Form (RHF), Formik, Final Form.
- **Behavior**: A field is 'dirty' if its value differs from the default. Reverting to the default value makes it 'clean' again.

Persistent `dirty` state

- **Libraries**: Angular Form, Vue FormKit.
- **Behavior**: A field remains 'dirty' once changed, even if reverted to the default value.

We have chosen the persistent 'dirty' state model. To also support a non-persistent 'dirty' state, we introduce an additional flag:

- _"isDefaultValue"_, whether the field's current value is the default value

```ts
const { isDefaultValue, isTouched } = field.state.meta;

// The following line will re-create the non-Persistent `dirty` functionality.
const nonPersistentIsDirty = !isDefaultValue;
```

![Field states extended](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TanStack/form/main/docs/assets/field-states-extended.png)

## Field API

The Field API is an object provided by a scoped slot using the `v-slot` directive. This slot receives an argument named `field` that provides methods and properties for working with the field's state.

Example:

```vue
<template v-slot="{ field }">
  <input
    :name="field.name"
    :value="field.state.value"
    @blur="field.handleBlur"
    @input="(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)"
  />
</template>
```

## Validation

`@tanstack/vue-form` provides both synchronous and asynchronous validation out of the box. Validation functions can be passed to the `form.Field` component using the `validators` prop.

Example:

```vue
<template>
    <!-- ... -->
    <form.Field
        name="firstName"
        :validators="{
            onChange: ({ value }) =>
                !value
                    ? `A first name is required`
                    : value.length < 3
                        ? `First name must be at least 3 characters`
                        : undefined,
            onChangeAsync: async ({ value }) => {
                await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
                return value.includes('error') && 'No "error" allowed in first name'
        },
    }"
    >
        <template v-slot="{ field }">
            <input
                :value="field.state.value"
                @input="(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)"
                @blur="field.handleBlur"
            />
            <FieldInfo :field="field" />
        </template>
    </form.Field>
    <!-- ... -->
</template>
```

## Validation with Standard Schema Libraries

In addition to hand-rolled validation options, we also support the [Standard Schema](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema) specification.

You can define a schema using any of the libraries implementing the specification and pass it to a form or field validator.

Supported libraries include:

- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) (v3.24.0 or higher)
- [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/) (v1.0.0 or higher)
- [ArkType](https://arktype.io/) (v2.1.20 or higher)
- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) (v1.7.0 or higher)

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useForm } from "@tanstack/vue-form";
import { z } from "zod";

const form = useForm({
  // ...
});

const onChangeFirstName = z.string().refine(
  async (value) => {
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    return !value.includes("error");
  },
  {
    message: "No 'error' allowed in first name",
  },
);
</script>

<template>
  <!-- ... -->
  <form.Field
    name="firstName"
    :validators="{
      onChange: z.string().min(3, 'First name must be at least 3 characters'),
      onChangeAsyncDebounceMs: 500,
      onChangeAsync: onChangeFirstName,
    }"
  >
    <template v-slot="{ field, state }">
      <label :htmlFor="field.name">First Name:</label>
      <input
        :id="field.name"
        :name="field.name"
        :value="field.state.value"
        @input="(e) => field.handleChange((e.target as HTMLInputElement).value)"
        @blur="field.handleBlur"
      />
      <FieldInfo :state="state" />
    </template>
  </form.Field>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
```

## Reactivity

`@tanstack/vue-form` offers various ways to subscribe to form and field state changes, most notably the `form.useStore` method and the `form.Subscribe` component. These methods allow you to optimize your form's rendering performance by only updating components when necessary.

Example:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
// ...
const firstName = form.useStore((state) => state.values.firstName);
</script>

<template>
  <!-- ... -->
  <form.Subscribe>
    <template v-slot="{ canSubmit, isSubmitting }">
      <button type="submit" :disabled="!canSubmit">
        {{ isSubmitting ? "..." : "Submit" }}
      </button>
    </template>
  </form.Subscribe>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
```

## Listeners

`@tanstack/vue-form` allows you to react to specific triggers and "listen" to them to dispatch side effects.

Example:

```vue
<template>
  <form.Field
    name="country"
    :listeners="{
      onChange: ({ value }) => {
        console.log(`Country changed to: ${value}, resetting province`);
        form.setFieldValue('province', '');
      },
    }"
  >
    <template v-slot="{ field }">
      <input
        :value="field.state.value"
        @input="(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)"
      />
    </template>
  </form.Field>
</template>
```

More information can be found at [Listeners](../listeners.md)

Note: The usage of the `form.useField` method to achieve reactivity is discouraged since it is designed to be used thoughtfully within the `form.Field` component. You might want to use `form.useStore` instead.

## Array Fields

Array fields allow you to manage a list of values within a form, such as a list of hobbies. You can create an array field using the `form.Field` component with the `mode="array"` prop.

When working with array fields, you can use the fields `pushValue`, `removeValue`, `swapValues` and `moveValue` methods to add, remove, and swap values in the array.

Example:

```vue
<template>
  <form @submit.prevent.stop="form.handleSubmit">
    <form.Field name="hobbies" mode="array">
      <template v-slot="{ field: hobbiesField }">
        <div>
          Hobbies
          <div>
            <div
              v-if="
                Array.isArray(hobbiesField.state.value) &&
                !hobbiesField.state.value.length
              "
            >
              No hobbies found.
            </div>
            <div v-else>
              <div v-for="(_, i) in hobbiesField.state.value" :key="i">
                <form.Field :name="`hobbies[${i}].name`">
                  <template v-slot="{ field }">
                    <div>
                      <label :for="field.name">Name:</label>
                      <input
                        :id="field.name"
                        :name="field.name"
                        :value="field.state.value"
                        @blur="field.handleBlur"
                        @input="(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)"
                      />
                      <button type="button" @click="hobbiesField.removeValue(i)">
                        X
                      </button>
                      <FieldInfo :field="field" />
                    </div>
                  </template>
                </form.Field>
                <form.Field :name="`hobbies[${i}].description`">
                  <template v-slot="{ field }">
                    <div>
                      <label :for="field.name">Description:</label>
                      <input
                        :id="field.name"
                        :name="field.name"
                        :value="field.state.value"
                        @blur="field.handleBlur"
                        @input="(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)"
                      />
                      <FieldInfo :field="field" />

title: Link Two Form Fields Together
---

You may find yourself needing to link two fields together; when one is validated as another field's value has changed.
One such usage is when you have both a `password` and `confirm_password` field,
where you want to `confirm_password` to error out when `password`'s value does not match;
regardless of which field triggered the value change.

Imagine the following userflow:

- User updates confirm password field.
- User updates the non-confirm password field.

In this example, the form will still have errors present,
as the "confirm password" field validation has not been re-ran to mark as accepted.

To solve this, we need to make sure that the "confirm password" validation is re-run when the password field is updated.
To do this, you can add a `onChangeListenTo` property to the `confirm_password` field.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useForm } from "@tanstack/vue-form";

const form = useForm({
  defaultValues: {
    password: "",
    confirm_password: "",
  },
  // ...
});
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <form @submit.prevent.stop="form.handleSubmit">
      <div>
        <form.Field name="password">
          <template v-slot="{ field }">
            <div>Password:</div>
            <input
              :value="field.state.value"
              @input="(e) => field.handleChange((e.target as HTMLInputElement).value)"
            />
          </template>
        </form.Field>
        <form.Field
          name="confirm_password"
          :validators="{
            onChangeListenTo: ['password'],
            onChange: ({ value, fieldApi }) => {
              if (value !== fieldApi.form.getFieldValue('password')) {
                return 'Passwords do not match';
              }
              return undefined;
            },
          }"
        >
          <template v-slot="{ field }">
            <div>Confirm Password:</div>
            <input
              :value="field.state.value"
              @input="(e) => field.handleChange((e.target as HTMLInputElement).value)"
            />
            <div v-for="(err, index) in field.state.meta.errors" :key="index">
              {{ err }}
            </div>
          </template>
        </form.Field>
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  </div>
</template>
```

This similarly works with `onBlurListenTo` property, which will re-run the validation when the field is blurred.

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/vue/guides/listeners.md">
---
id: listeners
title: Side effects for event triggers
---

For situations where you want to "affect" or "react" to triggers, there's the listener API. For example, if you, as the developer, want to reset a form field as a result of another field changing, you would use the listener API.

Imagine the following user flow:

- User selects a country from a drop-down.
- User then selects a province from another drop-down.
- User changes the selected country to a different one.

In this example, when the user changes the country, the selected province needs to be reset as it's no longer valid. With the listener API, we can subscribe to the onChange event and dispatch a reset to the field "province" when the listener is fired.

Events that can be "listened" to are:

- onChange
- onBlur
- onMount
- onSubmit

```vue
<script setup>
import { useForm } from "@tanstack/vue-form";

const form = useForm({
  defaultValues: {
    country: "",
    province: "",
  },
  // ...
});
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <form.Field
      name="country"
      :listeners="{
        onChange: ({ value }) => {
          console.log(`Country changed to: ${value}, resetting province`);
          form.setFieldValue('province', '');
        },
      }"
    >
      <template v-slot="{ field }">
        <input
          :value="field.state.value"
          @input="(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)"
        />
      </template>
    </form.Field>

    <form.Field name="province">
      <template v-slot="{ field }">
        <input
          :value="field.state.value"
          @input="(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)"
        />

```

title: Submission handling

## Passing additional data to submission handling

You may have multiple types of submission behaviour, for example, going back to another page or staying on the form.
You can accomplish this by specifying the `onSubmitMeta` property. This meta data will be passed to the `onSubmit` function.

> Note: if `form.handleSubmit()` is called without metadata, it will use the provided default.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useForm } from "@tanstack/vue-form";

type FormMeta = {
  submitAction: "continue" | "backToMenu" | null;
};

// Metadata is not required to call form.handleSubmit().
// Specify what values to use as default if no meta is passed
const defaultMeta: FormMeta = {
  submitAction: null,
};

const form = useForm({
  defaultValues: {
    data: "",
  },
  // Define what meta values to expect on submission
  onSubmitMeta: defaultMeta,
  onSubmit: async ({ value, meta }) => {
    // Do something with the values passed via handleSubmit
    console.log(`Selected action - ${meta.submitAction}`, value);
  },
});
</script>

<template>
  <form @submit.prevent.stop="">
    <button
      type="submit"
      @click="
        () => {
          // Overwrites the default specified in onSubmitMeta
          form.handleSubmit({ submitAction: 'continue' });
        }
      "
    >
      Submit and continue
    </button>
    <button
      type="submit"
      @click="() => form.handleSubmit({ submitAction: 'backToMenu' })"
    >
      Submit and back to menu
    </button>
  </form>
</template>
```

## Transforming data with Standard Schemas

While Tanstack Form provides [Standard Schema support](../validation.md) for validation, it does not preserve the Schema's output data.

The value passed to the `onSubmit` function will always be the input data. To receive the output data of a Standard Schema, parse it in the `onSubmit` function:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { z } from "zod";
import { useForm } from "@tanstack/vue-form";

const schema = z.object({
  age: z.string().transform((age) => Number(age)),
});

// Tanstack form uses the input type of Standard Schemas
const defaultValues: z.input<typeof schema> = {
  age: "13",
};

const form = useForm({
  defaultValues,
  validators: {
    onChange: schema,
  },
  onSubmit: ({ value }) => {
    const inputAge: string = value.age;
    // Pass it through the schema to get the transformed value
    const result = schema.parse(value);
    const outputAge: number = result.age;
  },
});
</script>

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/framework/vue/guides/validation.md">

id: form-validation
title: Form and Field Validation
---

At the core of TanStack Form's functionalities is the concept of validation. TanStack Form makes validation highly customizable:

- You can control when to perform the validation (on change, on input, on blur, on submit...)
- Validation rules can be defined at the field level or at the form level
- Validation can be synchronous or asynchronous (for example, as a result of an API call)

## When is validation performed?

It's up to you! The `<Field />` component accepts some callbacks as props such as `onChange` or `onBlur`. Those callbacks are passed the current value of the field, as well as the `fieldAPI` object, so that you can perform the validation. If you find a validation error, simply return the error message as string and it will be available in `field.state.meta.errors`.

Here is an example:

```vue
<template>
  <!-- ... -->
  <form.Field
    name="age"
    :validators="{
      onChange: ({ value }) =>
        value < 13 ? 'You must be 13 to make an account' : undefined,
    }"
  >
    <template v-slot="{ field }">
      <label :for="field.name">Age:</label>
      <input
        :id="field.name"
        :name="field.name"
        :value="field.state.value"
        type="number"
        @input="(e) => field.handleChange((e.target as HTMLInputElement).valueAsNumber)
                "
      />
      <em role="alert" v-if="!field.state.meta.isValid">{{
        field.state.meta.errors.join(", ")
      }}</em>
    </template>
  </form.Field>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
```

In the example above, the validation is done at each keystroke (`onChange`). If, instead, we wanted the validation to be done when the field is blurred, we would change the code above like so:

```vue
<template>
  <!-- ... -->
  <form.Field
    name="age"
    :validators="{
      onBlur: ({ value }) =>
        value < 13 ? 'You must be 13 to make an account' : undefined,
    }"
  >
    <template v-slot="{ field }">
      <label :for="field.name">Age:</label>
      <!-- We always need to implement onChange, so that TanStack Form receives the changes -->
      <!-- Listen to the onBlur event on the field -->
      <input
        :id="field.name"
        :name="field.name"
        :value="field.state.value"
        type="number"
        @blur="field.handleBlur"
        @input="(e) => field.handleChange((e.target as HTMLInputElement).valueAsNumber)
                "
      />
      <em role="alert" v-if="!field.state.meta.isValid">{{
        field.state.meta.errors.join(", ")
      }}</em>
    </template>
  </form.Field>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
```

So you can control when the validation is done by implementing the desired callback. You can even perform different pieces of validation at different times:

```vue
<template>
  <!-- ... -->
  <form.Field
    name="age"
    :validators="{
      onChange: ({ value }) =>
        value < 13 ? 'You must be 13 to make an account' : undefined,
      onBlur: ({ value }) => (value < 0 ? 'Invalid value' : undefined),
    }"
  >
    <template v-slot="{ field }">
      <label :for="field.name">Age:</label>
      <!-- We always need to implement onChange, so that TanStack Form receives the changes -->
      <!-- Listen to the onBlur event on the field -->
      <input
        :id="field.name"
        :name="field.name"
        :value="field.state.value"
        type="number"
        @blur="field.handleBlur"
        @input="(e) => field.handleChange((e.target as HTMLInputElement).valueAsNumber)
                "
      />
      <em role="alert" v-if="!field.state.meta.isValid">{{
        field.state.meta.errors.join(", ")
      }}</em>
    </template>
  </form.Field>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
```

In the example above, we are validating different things on the same field at different times (at each keystroke and when blurring the field). Since `field.state.meta.errors` is an array, all the relevant errors at a given time are displayed. You can also use `field.state.meta.errorMap` to get errors based on _when_ the validation was done (onChange, onBlur etc...). More info about displaying errors below.

## Displaying Errors

Once you have your validation in place, you can map the errors from an array to be displayed in your UI:

```vue
<template>
  <!-- ... -->
  <form.Field
    name="age"
    :validators="{
      onChange: ({ value }) =>
        value < 13 ? 'You must be 13 to make an account' : undefined,
    }"
  >
    <template v-slot="{ field }">
      <!-- ... -->
      <em role="alert" v-if="!field.state.meta.isValid">{{
        field.state.meta.errors.join(", ")
      }}</em>
    </template>
  </form.Field>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
```

Or use the `errorMap` property to access the specific error you're looking for:

```vue
<template>
  <!-- ... -->
  <form.Field
    name="age"
    :validators="{
      onChange: ({ value }) =>
        value < 13 ? 'You must be 13 to make an account' : undefined,
    }"
  >
    <template v-slot="{ field }">
      <!-- ... -->
      <em role="alert" v-if="field.state.meta.errorMap['onChange']">{{
        field.state.meta.errorMap["onChange"]
      }}</em>
    </template>
  </form.Field>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
```

It's worth mentioning that our `errors` array and the `errorMap` matches the types returned by the validators. This means that:

```vue
<form.Field
  name="age"
  :validators="{
    onChange: ({ value }) => (value < 13 ? { isOldEnough: false } : undefined),
  }"
>
  <template v-slot="{ field }">
      <!-- ... -->
      <!-- errorMap.onChange is type `{isOldEnough: false} | undefined` -->
	  <!-- meta.errors is type `Array<{isOldEnough: false} | undefined>` -->
      <em v-if="!field.state.meta.errorMap['onChange']?.isOldEnough">The user is not old enough</em>
  </template>
</form.Field>
```

## Validation at field level vs at form level

As shown above, each `<Field>` accepts its own validation rules via the `onChange`, `onBlur` etc... callbacks. It is also possible to define validation rules at the form level (as opposed to field by field) by passing similar callbacks to the `useForm()` function.

Example:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useForm } from "@tanstack/vue-form";

const form = useForm({
  defaultValues: {
    age: 0,
  },
  onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
    console.log(value);
  },
  validators: {
    // Add validators to the form the same way you would add them to a field
    onChange({ value }) {
      if (value.age < 13) {
        return "Must be 13 or older to sign";
      }
      return undefined;
    },
  },
});

// Subscribe to the form's error map so that updates to it will render
// alternately, you can use `form.Subscribe`
const formErrorMap = form.useStore((state) => state.errorMap);
</script>

<template>
  <!-- ... -->
  <div v-if="formErrorMap.onChange">
    <em role="alert"> There was an error on the form: {{ formErrorMap.onChange }} </em>
  </div>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
```

### Setting field-level errors from the form's validators

You can set errors on the fields from the form's validators. One common use case for this is validating all the fields on submit by calling a single API endpoint in the form's `onSubmitAsync` validator.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useForm } from "@tanstack/vue-form";

const form = useForm({
  defaultValues: {
    age: 0,
    socials: [],
    details: {
      email: "",
    },
  },
  validators: {
    // Add validators to the form the same way you would add them to a field
    onSubmitAsync({ value }) {
      // Validate the value on the server
      const hasErrors = await verifyDataOnServer(value);
      if (hasErrors) {
        return {
          form: "Invalid data", // The `form` key is optional
          fields: {
            age: "Must be 13 or older to sign",
            // Set errors on nested fields with the field's name
            "socials[0].url": "The provided URL does not exist",
            "details.email": "An email is required",
          },
        };
      }

      return null;
    },
  },
});
</script>

<template>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
```

> Something worth mentioning is that if you have a form validation function that returns an error, that error may be overwritten by the field-specific validation.

>     </template>
>   </form.Field>
> </template>
> ```
>
> Will only show `'Must be odd!` even if the 'Too young!' error is returned by the form-level validation.

## Asynchronous Functional Validation

While we suspect most validations will be synchronous, there are many instances where a network call or some other async operation would be useful to validate against.

To do this, we have dedicated `onChangeAsync`, `onBlurAsync`, and other methods that can be used to validate against:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
// ...

const onChangeAge = async ({ value }) => {
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  return value < 13 ? "You must be 13 to make an account" : undefined;
};
</script>

<template>
  <!-- ... -->
  <form.Field
    name="age"
    :validators="{
      onChangeAsync: onChangeAge,
    }"
  >
    <template v-slot="{ field }">
      <label :for="field.name">Age:</label>
      <input
        :id="field.name"
        :name="field.name"
        :value="field.state.value"
        type="number"
        @input="(e) => field.handleChange((e.target as HTMLInputElement).valueAsNumber)"
      />
      <em role="alert" v-if="!field.state.meta.isValid">{{
        field.state.meta.errors.join(", ")
      }}</em>
    </template>
  </form.Field>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
```

Synchronous and Asynchronous validations can coexist. For example, it is possible to define both `onBlur` and `onBlurAsync` on the same field:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
// ...

const onBlurAge = ({ value }) => (value < 0 ? "Invalid value" : undefined);

const onBlurAgeAsync = async ({ value }) => {
  const currentAge = await fetchCurrentAgeOnProfile();
  return value < currentAge ? "You can only increase the age" : undefined;
};
</script>

<template>
  <!-- ... -->
  <form.Field
    name="age"
    :validators="{
      onBlur: onBlurAge,
      onBlurAsync: onBlurAgeAsync,
    }"
  >
    <template v-slot="{ field }">
      <label :for="field.name">Age:</label>
      <input
        :id="field.name"
        :name="field.name"
        :value="field.state.value"
        type="number"
        @blur="field.handleBlur"
        @input="(e) => field.handleChange((e.target as HTMLInputElement).valueAsNumber)"
      />
      <em role="alert" v-if="!field.state.meta.isValid">{{
        field.state.meta.errors.join(", ")
      }}</em>
    </template>
  </form.Field>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
```

The synchronous validation method (`onBlur`) is run first and the asynchronous method (`onBlurAsync`) is only run if the synchronous one (`onBlur`) succeeds. To change this behaviour, set the `asyncAlways` option to `true`, and the async method will be run regardless of the result of the sync method.

### Built-in Debouncing

While async calls are the way to go when validating against the database, running a network request on every keystroke is a good way to DDOS your database.

Instead, we enable an easy method for debouncing your `async` calls by adding a single property:

```vue
<template>
  <!-- ... -->
  <form.Field
    name="age"
    :async-debounce-ms="500"
    :validators="{
      onChangeAsync: async ({ value }) => {
        // ...
      },
    }"
  >
    <template v-slot="{ field }">
      <!-- ... -->
    </template>
  </form.Field>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
```

This will debounce every async call with a 500ms delay. You can even override this property on a per-validation property:

```vue
<template>
  <!-- ... -->
  <form.Field
    name="age"
    :async-debounce-ms="500"
    :validators="{
      onChangeAsyncDebounceMs: 1500,
      onChangeAsync: async ({ value }) => {
        // ...
      },
      onBlurAsync: async ({ value }) => {
        // ...
      },
    }"
  >
    <template v-slot="{ field }">
      <!-- ... -->
    </template>
  </form.Field>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
```

This will run `onChangeAsync` every 1500ms while `onBlurAsync` will run every 500ms.

## Validation through Schema Libraries

While functions provide more flexibility and customization over your validation, they can be a bit verbose. To help solve this, there are libraries that provide schema-based validation to make shorthand and type-strict validation substantially easier. You can also define a single schema for your entire form and pass it to the form level, errors will be automatically propagated to the fields.

### Standard Schema Libraries

TanStack Form natively supports all libraries following the [Standard Schema specification](https://github.com/standard-schema/standard-schema), most notably:

- [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/)
- [ArkType](https://arktype.io/)

_Note:_ make sure to use the latest version of the schema libraries as older versions might not support Standard Schema yet.

> Validation will not provide you with transformed values. See [submission handling](../submission-handling.md) for more information.

To use schemas from these libraries you can pass them to the `validators` props as you would do with a custom function:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { z } from "zod";
// ...

const form = useForm({
  // ...
});
</script>

<template>
  <!-- ... -->
  <form.Field
    name="age"
    :validators="{
      onChange: z.number().gte(13, 'You must be 13 to make an account'),
    }"
  >
    <template v-slot="{ field }">
      <!-- ... -->
    </template>
  </form.Field>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
```

Async validations on form and field level are supported as well:

```vue
<template>
  <!-- ... -->
  <form.Field
    name="age"
    :validators="{
      onChange: z.number().gte(13, 'You must be 13 to make an account'),
      onChangeAsyncDebounceMs: 500,
      onChangeAsync: z.number().refine(
        async (value) => {
          const currentAge = await fetchCurrentAgeOnProfile();
          return value >= currentAge;
        },
        {
          message: 'You can only increase the age',
        },
      ),
    }"
  >
    <template v-slot="{ field }">
      <!-- ... -->
    </template>
  </form.Field>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
```

If you need even more control over your Standard Schema validation, you can combine a Standard Schema with a callback function like so:

```vue
<template>
  <!-- ... -->
  <form.Field
    name="age"
    :validators="{
      onChange: ({ value, fieldApi }) => {
        const errors = fieldApi.parseValueWithSchema(
          z.number().gte(13, 'You must be 13 to make an account'),
        );

        if (errors) return errors;

        // continue with your validation
      },
    }"
  >
    <template v-slot="{ field }">
      <!-- ... -->
    </template>
  </form.Field>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
```

## Preventing invalid forms from being submitted

The `onChange`, `onBlur` etc... callbacks are also run when the form is submitted and the submission is blocked if the form is invalid.

The form state object has a `canSubmit` flag that is false when any field is invalid and the form has been touched (`canSubmit` is true until the form has been touched, even if some fields are "technically" invalid based on their `onChange`/`onBlur` props).

You can subscribe to it via `form.Subscribe` and use the value in order to, for example, disable the submit button when the form is invalid (in practice, disabled buttons are not accessible, use `aria-disabled` instead).

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const form = useForm(/* ... */);
</script>

<template>
  <!-- ... -->

  <!-- Dynamic submit button -->
  <form.Subscribe>
    <template v-slot="{ canSubmit, isSubmitting }">
      <button type="submit" :disabled="!canSubmit">
        {{ isSubmitting ? "..." : "Submit" }}
      </button>
    </template>
  </form.Subscribe>
  <!-- ... -->
</template>
```

The bare minimum to get started with TanStack Form is to create a form and add a field. Keep in mind that this example does not include any validation or error handling... yet.

```vue
<!-- App.vue -->
<script setup>
import { useForm } from "@tanstack/vue-form";

const form = useForm({
  defaultValues: {
    fullName: "",
  },
  onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
    // Do something with form data
    console.log(value);
  },
});
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <form @submit.prevent.stop="form.handleSubmit">
      <div>
        <form.Field name="fullName">
          <template v-slot="{ field }">
            <input
              :name="field.name"
              :value="field.state.value"
              @blur="field.handleBlur"
              @input="(e) => field.handleChange((e.target as HTMLInputElement).value)"
            />
          </template>
        </form.Field>
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  </div>
</template>
```

From here, you'll be ready to explore all of the other features of TanStack Form!

# Class: FieldApi\<TParentData, TName, TData, TOnMount, TOnChange, TOnChangeAsync, TOnBlur, TOnBlurAsync, TOnSubmit, TOnSubmitAsync, TFormOnMount, TFormOnChange, TFormOnChangeAsync, TFormOnBlur, TFormOnBlurAsync, TFormOnSubmit, TFormOnSubmitAsync, TFormOnServer, TParentSubmitMeta\>

Defined in: [packages/form-core/src/FieldApi.ts:863](https://github.com/TanStack/form/blob/main/packages/form-core/src/FieldApi.ts#L863)

A class representing the API for managing a form field.

Normally, you will not need to create a new `FieldApi` instance directly.
Instead, you will use a framework hook/function like `useField` or `createField`
to create a new instance for you that uses your framework's reactivity model.
However, if you need to create a new instance manually, you can do so by calling
the `new FieldApi` constructor.

# Class: FormApi\<TFormData, TOnMount, TOnChange, TOnChangeAsync, TOnBlur, TOnBlurAsync, TOnSubmit, TOnSubmitAsync, TOnServer, TSubmitMeta\>

Defined in: [packages/form-core/src/FormApi.ts:778](https://github.com/TanStack/form/blob/main/packages/form-core/src/FormApi.ts#L778)

A class representing the Form API. It handles the logic and interactions with the form state.

Normally, you will not need to create a new `FormApi` instance directly. Instead, you will use a framework
hook/function like `useForm` or `createForm` to create a new instance for you that uses your framework's reactivity model.
However, if you need to create a new instance manually, you can do so by calling the `new FormApi` constructor.

## Type Parameters

• **TFormData**

• **TOnMount** _extends_ `undefined` \| `FormValidateOrFn`\<`TFormData`\>

• **TOnChange** _extends_ `undefined` \| `FormValidateOrFn`\<`TFormData`\>

• **TOnChangeAsync** _extends_ `undefined` \| `FormAsyncValidateOrFn`\<`TFormData`\>

• **TOnBlur** _extends_ `undefined` \| `FormValidateOrFn`\<`TFormData`\>

• **TOnBlurAsync** _extends_ `undefined` \| `FormAsyncValidateOrFn`\<`TFormData`\>

• **TOnSubmit** _extends_ `undefined` \| `FormValidateOrFn`\<`TFormData`\>

• **TOnSubmitAsync** _extends_ `undefined` \| `FormAsyncValidateOrFn`\<`TFormData`\>

• **TOnServer** _extends_ `undefined` \| `FormAsyncValidateOrFn`\<`TFormData`\>

• **TSubmitMeta** = `never`

## Implements

• **TOnServer** _extends_ `undefined` \| `FormAsyncValidateOrFn`\<`TFormData`\>

## Type declaration

### \_force_re_eval?

```ts
optional _force_re_eval: boolean;
```

@private, used to force a re-evaluation of the form state when options change

### errorMap

```ts
errorMap: ValidationErrorMap<
  UnwrapFormValidateOrFn<TOnMount>,
  UnwrapFormValidateOrFn<TOnChange>,
  UnwrapFormAsyncValidateOrFn<TOnChangeAsync>,
  UnwrapFormValidateOrFn<TOnBlur>,
  UnwrapFormAsyncValidateOrFn<TOnBlurAsync>,
  UnwrapFormValidateOrFn<TOnSubmit>,
  UnwrapFormAsyncValidateOrFn<TOnSubmitAsync>,
  UnwrapFormAsyncValidateOrFn<TOnServer>
>;
```

The error map for the form itself.

### fieldMetaBase

```ts
fieldMetaBase: Record<DeepKeys<TFormData>, AnyFieldMetaBase>;
```

A record of field metadata for each field in the form, not including the derived properties, like `errors` and such

### isSubmitSuccessful

```ts
isSubmitSuccessful: boolean;
```

A boolean indicating if the last submission was successful.

### isSubmitted

```ts
isSubmitted: boolean;
```

A boolean indicating if the `onSubmit` function has completed successfully.

Goes back to `false` at each new submission attempt.

Note: you can use isSubmitting to check if the form is currently submitting.

### isSubmitting

```ts
isSubmitting: boolean;
```

A boolean indicating if the form is currently in the process of being submitted after `handleSubmit` is called.

Goes back to `false` when submission completes for one of the following reasons:

- the validation step returned errors.
- the `onSubmit` function has completed.

Note: if you're running async operations in your `onSubmit` function make sure to await them to ensure `isSubmitting` is set to `false` only when the async operation completes.

This is useful for displaying loading indicators or disabling form inputs during submission.

### isValidating

```ts
isValidating: boolean;
```

A boolean indicating if the form or any of its fields are currently validating.

### submissionAttempts

```ts
submissionAttempts: number;
```

A counter for tracking the number of submission attempts.

### validationMetaMap

```ts
validationMetaMap: Record<ValidationErrorMapKeys, ValidationMeta | undefined>;
```

An internal mechanism used for keeping track of validation logic in a form.

### values

```ts
values: TFormData;
```

The current values of the form fields.

TanStack Form is the ultimate solution for handling forms in web applications, providing a powerful and flexible approach to form management. Designed with first-class TypeScript support, headless UI components, and a framework-agnostic design, it streamlines form handling and ensures a seamless experience across various front-end frameworks.

## Motivation

Most web frameworks do not offer a comprehensive solution for form handling, leaving developers to create their own custom implementations or rely on less-capable libraries. This often results in a lack of consistency, poor performance, and increased development time. TanStack Form aims to address these challenges by providing an all-in-one solution for managing forms that is both powerful and easy to use.

With TanStack Form, developers can tackle common form-related challenges such as:

- Reactive data binding and state management
- Complex validation and error handling
- Accessibility and responsive design
- Internationalization and localization
- Cross-platform compatibility and custom styling

By providing a complete solution for these challenges, TanStack Form empowers developers to build robust and user-friendly forms with ease.

## Enough talk, show me some code already!

In the example below, you can see TanStack Form in action with the React framework adapter:

[Open in CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/tanstack/form/tree/main/examples/react/simple)

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { useForm } from "@tanstack/react-form";
import type { AnyFieldApi } from "@tanstack/react-form";

function FieldInfo({ field }: { field: AnyFieldApi }) {
  return (
    <>
      {field.state.meta.isTouched && !field.state.meta.isValid ? (
        <em>{field.state.meta.errors.join(", ")}</em>
      ) : null}
      {field.state.meta.isValidating ? "Validating..." : null}
    </>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  const form = useForm({
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: "",
      lastName: "",

## You talked me into it, so what now?

- Learn TanStack Form at your own pace with our thorough [Walkthrough Guide](../installation) and [API Reference](../reference/classes/formapi)
</file>

<file path="docs/tanstack-form/philosophy.md">

id: philosophy
title: Philosophy
---

Every well-established project should have a philosophy that guides its development. Without a core philosophy, development can languish in endless decision-making and have weaker APIs as a result.

This document outlines the core principles that drive the development and feature-set of TanStack Form.

## Upgrading unified APIs

APIs come with tradeoffs. As a result, it can be tempting to make each set of tradeoffs available to the user through different APIs. However, this can lead to a fragmented API that is harder to learn and use.

While this may mean a higher learning curve, it means that you don't have to question which API to use internally or have higher cognitive overhead when switching between APIs.

## Forms need flexibility

TanStack Form is designed to be flexible and customizable. While many forms may conform to similar patterns, there are always exceptions; especially when forms are a core component of your application.

As a result, TanStack Form supports multiple methods for validation:

- **Timing customizations**: You can validate on blur, change, submit, or even on mount.
- **Validation strategies**: You can validate on individual fields, the entire form, or a subset of fields.
- **Custom validation logic**: You can write your own validation logic or use a library like [Zod](https://zod.dev/) or [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/).
- **Custom error messages**: You can customize the error messages for each field by returning any object from a validator.
- **Async validation**: You can validate fields asynchronously and have common utils like debouncing and cancellation handled for you.

## Controlled is Cool

In a world where controlled vs uncontrolled inputs are a hot topic, TanStack Form is firmly in the controlled camp.

This comes with a number of advantages:

- **Predictable**: You can predict the state of your form at any point in time.
- **Easier testing**: You can easily test your forms by passing in values and asserting on the output.
- **Non-DOM support**: You can use TanStack Form with React Native, Three.js framework adapters, or any other framework renderer.
- **Enhanced conditional logic**: You can easily conditionally show/hide fields based on the form state.
- **Debugging**: You can easily log the form state to the console to debug issues.

## Generics are grim

You should never need to pass a generic or use an internal type when leveraging TanStack Form. This is because we've designed the library to inference everything from runtime defaults.

When writing sufficiently correct TanStack Form code, you should not be able to distinguish between JavaScript usage and TypeScript usage, with the exception of any type casts you might do of runtime values.

Instead of:

```typescript
useForm<MyForm>();
```

You should do:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const defaultPerson: Person = { name: "Bill Luo", age: 24 };

useForm({
  defaultValues: defaultPerson,
});
```

## Libraries are liberating

One of the main objectives of TanStack Form is that you should be wrapping it into your own component system or design system.

To support this, we have a number of utilities that make it easier to build your own components and customized hooks:

```typescript
// Exported from your own library with pre-bound components for your forms.
export const { useAppForm, withForm } = createFormHook(/* options */);
```

Without doing so, you're adding substantially more boilerplate to your apps and making your forms less consistent and user-friendly.

id: typescript
title: TypeScript
---

TanStack Form is written 100% in **TypeScript** with the highest quality generics, constraints and interfaces to make sure the library and your projects are as type-safe as possible!

Things to keep in mind:

- `strict: true` is required in your `tsconfig.json` to get the most out of TanStack Form's types
- Types currently require using TypeScript v5.4 or greater
- Changes to types in this repository are considered **non-breaking** and are usually released as **patch** semver changes (otherwise every type enhancement would be a major version!).
- It is **highly recommended that you lock your react-form package version to a specific patch release and upgrade with the expectation that types may be fixed or upgraded between any release**
- The non-type-related public API of TanStack Form still follows semver very strictly.

---
title: How to Use Environment Variables
---

Learn how to securely configure and use environment variables in your TanStack Start application across different contexts (server functions, client code, and build processes).

## Quick Start

TanStack Start automatically loads `.env` files and makes variables available in both server and client contexts with proper security boundaries.

```bash
# .env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb
VITE_APP_NAME=My TanStack Start App
```

```typescript
// Server function - can access any environment variable
const getUser = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
  const db = await connect(process.env.DATABASE_URL) // ✅ Server-only
  return db.user.findFirst()
})

// Client component - only VITE_ prefixed variables
export function AppHeader() {
  return <h1>{import.meta.env.VITE_APP_NAME}</h1> // ✅ Client-safe
}
```

## Environment Variable Contexts

### Server-Side Context (Server Functions & API Routes)

Server functions can access **any** environment variable using `process.env`:

```typescript
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

// Database connection (server-only)
const connectToDatabase = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
  const connectionString = process.env.DATABASE_URL; // No prefix needed
  const apiKey = process.env.EXTERNAL_API_SECRET; // Stays on server

  // These variables are never exposed to the client
  return await database.connect(connectionString);
});

// Authentication (server-only)
const authenticateUser = createServerFn()
  .validator(z.object({ token: z.string() }))
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    const jwtSecret = process.env.JWT_SECRET; // Server-only
    return jwt.verify(data.token, jwtSecret);
  });
```

### Client-Side Context (Components & Client Code)

Client code can only access variables with the `VITE_` prefix:

```typescript
// Client configuration
export function ApiProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL     // ✅ Public
  const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_PUBLIC_KEY  // ✅ Public

  // This would be undefined (security feature):
  // const secret = import.meta.env.DATABASE_URL   // ❌ Undefined

  return (
    <ApiContext.Provider value={{ apiUrl, apiKey }}>
      {children}
    </ApiContext.Provider>
  )
}

// Feature flags
export function FeatureGatedComponent() {
  const enableNewFeature = import.meta.env.VITE_ENABLE_NEW_FEATURE === 'true'

  if (!enableNewFeature) return null

  return <NewFeature />
}
```

## Environment File Setup

### File Hierarchy (Loaded in Order)

TanStack Start automatically loads environment files in this order:

```
.env.local          # Local overrides (add to .gitignore)
.env.production     # Production-specific variables
.env.development    # Development-specific variables
.env                # Default variables (commit to git)
```

### Example Setup

**.env** (committed to repository):

```bash
# Public configuration
VITE_APP_NAME=My TanStack Start App
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=https://...

# Server configuration templates
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/myapp_dev
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

**.env.local** (add to .gitignore):

```bash
# Override for local development
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/myapp_local
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
JWT_SECRET=your-local-secret
```

**.env.production**:

```bash
# Production overrides
VITE_API_URL=https://api.myapp.com
DATABASE_POOL_SIZE=20
```

## Common Patterns

### Database Configuration

```typescript
// src/lib/database.ts
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

const getDatabaseConnection = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
  const config = {
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    maxConnections: parseInt(process.env.DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS || "10"),
    ssl: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
  };

  return createConnection(config);
});
```

### Authentication Provider Setup

```typescript
// src/lib/auth.ts (Server)
export const authConfig = {
  secret: process.env.AUTH_SECRET,
  providers: {
    auth0: {
      domain: process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN,
      clientId: process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET, // Server-only
    }
  }
}

// src/components/AuthProvider.tsx (Client)
export function AuthProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <Auth0Provider
      domain={import.meta.env.VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN}
      clientId={import.meta.env.VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID}
      // No client secret here - it stays on the server
    >
      {children}
    </Auth0Provider>
  )
}
```

### External API Integration

```typescript
// src/lib/external-api.ts
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

// Server-side API calls (can use secret keys)
const fetchUserData = createServerFn()
  .validator(z.object({ userId: z.string() }))
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    const response = await fetch(`${process.env.EXTERNAL_API_URL}/users/${data.userId}`, {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.EXTERNAL_API_SECRET}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
    });

    return response.json();
  });

// Client-side API calls (public endpoints only)
export function usePublicData() {
  const apiUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_PUBLIC_API_URL;

  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ["public-data"],
    queryFn: () => fetch(`${apiUrl}/public/stats`).then((r) => r.json()),
  });
}
```

### Feature Flags and Configuration

```typescript
// src/config/features.ts
export const featureFlags = {
  enableNewDashboard: import.meta.env.VITE_ENABLE_NEW_DASHBOARD === 'true',
  enableAnalytics: import.meta.env.VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS === 'true',
  debugMode: import.meta.env.VITE_DEBUG_MODE === 'true',
}

// Usage in components
export function Dashboard() {
  if (featureFlags.enableNewDashboard) {
    return <NewDashboard />
  }

  return <LegacyDashboard />
}
```

## Type Safety

### TypeScript Declarations

Create `src/env.d.ts` to add type safety:

```typescript
/// <reference types="vite/client" />

interface ImportMetaEnv {
  // Client-side environment variables
  readonly VITE_APP_NAME: string;
  readonly VITE_API_URL: string;
  readonly VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN: string;
  readonly VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID: string;
  readonly VITE_SENTRY_DSN?: string;
  readonly VITE_ENABLE_NEW_DASHBOARD?: string;
}

interface ImportMeta {
  readonly env: ImportMetaEnv;
}

// Server-side environment variables
declare global {
  namespace NodeJS {
    interface ProcessEnv {
      readonly DATABASE_URL: string;
      readonly REDIS_URL: string;
      readonly JWT_SECRET: string;
      readonly AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET: string;
      readonly STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: string;
      readonly NODE_ENV: "development" | "production" | "test";
    }
  }
}

export {};
```

### Runtime Validation

Use Zod for runtime validation of environment variables:

```typescript
// src/config/env.ts
import { z } from "zod";

const envSchema = z.object({
  DATABASE_URL: z.string().url(),
  JWT_SECRET: z.string().min(32),
  NODE_ENV: z.enum(["development", "production", "test"]),
});

const clientEnvSchema = z.object({
  VITE_APP_NAME: z.string(),
  VITE_API_URL: z.string().url(),
  VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN: z.string(),
  VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID: z.string(),
});

// Validate server environment
export const serverEnv = envSchema.parse(process.env);

// Validate client environment
export const clientEnv = clientEnvSchema.parse(import.meta.env);
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Never Expose Secrets to Client

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Secret exposed to client bundle
const config = {
  apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_SECRET_API_KEY, // This will be in your JS bundle!
};

// ✅ CORRECT - Keep secrets on server
const getApiData = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
  const response = await fetch(apiUrl, {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.SECRET_API_KEY}` },
  });
  return response.json();
});
```

### 2. Use Appropriate Prefixes

```bash
# ✅ Server-only (no prefix)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
JWT_SECRET=super-secret-key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...

# ✅ Client-safe (VITE_ prefix)
VITE_APP_NAME=My App
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=https://...
```

### 3. Validate Required Variables

```typescript
// src/config/validation.ts
const requiredServerEnv = ["DATABASE_URL", "JWT_SECRET"] as const;

const requiredClientEnv = ["VITE_APP_NAME", "VITE_API_URL"] as const;

// Validate on server startup
for (const key of requiredServerEnv) {
  if (!process.env[key]) {
    throw new Error(`Missing required environment variable: ${key}`);
  }
}

// Validate client environment at build time
for (const key of requiredClientEnv) {
  if (!import.meta.env[key]) {
    throw new Error(`Missing required environment variable: ${key}`);
  }
}
```

## Production Checklist

- [ ] All sensitive variables are server-only (no `VITE_` prefix)
- [ ] Client variables use `VITE_` prefix
- [ ] `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Production environment variables are configured on hosting platform
- [ ] Required environment variables are validated at startup
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in source code
- [ ] Database URLs use connection pooling in production
- [ ] API keys are rotated regularly

## Common Problems

### Environment Variable is Undefined

**Problem**: `import.meta.env.MY_VARIABLE` returns `undefined`

**Solutions**:

1. **Add correct prefix**: Use `VITE_` prefix (e.g. `VITE_MY_VARIABLE`)
   Vite's default prefix may be changed in the config:
   ```ts
   // vite.config.ts
   export const config = {
     // ...rest of your config
     envPrefix: "MYPREFIX_", // this means `MYPREFIX_MY_VARIABLE` is the new correct way
   };
   ```
2. **Restart development server** after adding new variables
3. **Check file location**: `.env` file must be in project root
4. **Verify bundler configuration**: Ensure variables are properly injected
5. **Verify variable**:

- **In dev**: is in correct `.env` file or environment
- **For prod**: is in correct `.env` file or current environment **_at bundle time_**. That's right, `VITE_`-prefixed variables are replaced in a macro-like fashion at bundle time, and will _never_ be read at runtime on your server. This is a common mistake, so make sure this is not your case.

**Example**:

```bash
# ❌ Won't work in client code
API_KEY=abc123

# ✅ Works in client code
VITE_API_KEY=abc123

# ❌ Won't bundle the variable (assuming it is not set in the environment of the build)
npm run build

# ✅ Works in client code and will bundle the variable for production
VITE_API_KEY=abc123 npm run build
```

### Runtime Client Environment Variables at Runtime in Production

**Problem**: If `VITE_` variables are replaced at bundle time only, how to make runtime variables available on the client ?

**Solutions**:

Pass variables from the server down to the client:

1. Add your variable to the correct `env.` file
2. Create an endpoint on your server to read the value from the client

**Example**:

Using Tanstack Start server functions:

```tsx
const getRuntimeVar = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(() => {
  return process.env.MY_RUNTIME_VAR; // notice `process.env` on the server, and no `VITE_` prefix
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  loader: async () => {
    const foo = await getRuntimeVar();
    return { foo };
  },
  component: RouteComponent,
});

function RouteComponent() {
  const { foo } = Route.useLoaderData();
  // ... use your variable however you want
}
```

### Variable Not Updating

**Problem**: Environment variable changes aren't reflected

**Solutions**:

1. Restart development server
2. Check if you're modifying the correct `.env` file
3. Verify file hierarchy (`.env.local` overrides `.env`)

### TypeScript Errors

**Problem**: `Property 'VITE_MY_VAR' does not exist on type 'ImportMetaEnv'`

**Solution**: Add to `src/env.d.ts`:

```typescript
interface ImportMetaEnv {
  readonly VITE_MY_VAR: string;
}
```

### Security: Secret Exposed to Client

**Problem**: Sensitive data appearing in client bundle

**Solutions**:

1. Remove `VITE_` prefix from sensitive variables
2. Move sensitive operations to server functions
3. Use build tools to verify no secrets in client bundle

### Build Errors in Production

**Problem**: Missing environment variables in production build

**Solutions**:

1. Configure variables on hosting platform
2. Validate required variables at build time
3. Use deployment-specific `.env` files

## Common Next Steps

<!-- [Set Up Authentication](./setup-authentication.md) - Use environment variables for auth providers -->
<!-- [Deploy to Production](./deploy-to-production.md) - Configure environment variables for different hosting platforms -->
<!-- [Set Up Database](./setup-database.md) - Configure database connections with environment variables -->

title: How to Write Isomorphic, Client-Only, and Server-Only Code
---

This guide covers TanStack Start's execution model and APIs for controlling where code runs.

## Core Principle: Isomorphic by Default

**All code in TanStack Start is isomorphic by default** - it runs and is included in both server and client bundles unless explicitly constrained.

```tsx
// ✅ This runs on BOTH server and client
function formatPrice(price: number) {
  return new Intl.NumberFormat("en-US", {
    style: "currency",
    currency: "USD",
  }).format(price);
}

// ✅ Route loaders are ISOMORPHIC
export const Route = createFileRoute("/products")({
  loader: async () => {
    // This runs on server during SSR AND on client during navigation
    const response = await fetch("/api/products");
    return response.json();
  },
});
```

**Important**: Route `loader`s are isomorphic - they run on both server and client.

---

## When You Need Execution Constraints

### Server-Only APIs

| API                | Use Case                  | Client Behavior           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `createServerFn()` | RPC calls, data mutations | Network request to server |
| `serverOnly(fn)`   | Utility functions         | Throws error              |

```tsx
import { createServerFn, serverOnly } from "@tanstack/react-start";

// RPC: Server execution, callable from client
const updateUser = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
  .validator((data: UserData) => data)
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    // Only runs on server, but client can call it
    return await db.users.update(data);
  });

// Utility: Server-only, client crashes if called
const getEnvVar = serverOnly(() => process.env.DATABASE_URL);
```

### Client-Only APIs

| API              | Use Case                        | Server Behavior  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `clientOnly(fn)` | Browser utilities               | Throws error     |
| `<ClientOnly>`   | Components needing browser APIs | Renders fallback |

```tsx
import { clientOnly } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { ClientOnly } from "@tanstack/react-router";

// Utility: Client-only, server crashes if called
const saveToStorage = clientOnly((key: string, value: any) => {
  localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
});

// Component: Only renders children after hydration
function Analytics() {
  return (
    <ClientOnly fallback={null}>
      <GoogleAnalyticsScript />
    </ClientOnly>
  );
}
```

### Environment-Specific Implementations

```tsx
import { createIsomorphicFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

// Different implementation per environment
const getDeviceInfo = createIsomorphicFn()
  .server(() => ({ type: "server", platform: process.platform }))
  .client(() => ({ type: "client", userAgent: navigator.userAgent }));
```

---

## Key Distinctions

### `createServerFn()` vs `serverOnly()`

```tsx
// createServerFn: RPC pattern - server execution, client callable
const fetchUser = createServerFn().handler(async () => await db.users.find());

// Usage from client component:
const user = await fetchUser(); // ✅ Network request

// serverOnly: Crashes if called from client
const getSecret = serverOnly(() => process.env.SECRET);

// Usage from client:
const secret = getSecret(); // ❌ Throws error
```

### Manual Environment Detection vs APIs

```tsx
// Manual: You handle the logic
function logMessage(msg: string) {
  if (typeof window === "undefined") {
    console.log(`[SERVER]: ${msg}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`[CLIENT]: ${msg}`);
  }
}

// API: Framework handles it
const logMessage = createIsomorphicFn()
  .server((msg) => console.log(`[SERVER]: ${msg}`))
  .client((msg) => console.log(`[CLIENT]: ${msg}`));
```

---

## Common Patterns

### Progressive Enhancement

```tsx
// Component works without JS, enhanced with JS
function SearchForm() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState("");

  return (
    <form action="/search" method="get">
      <input name="q" value={query} onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)} />
      <ClientOnly fallback={<button type="submit">Search</button>}>
        <SearchButton onSearch={() => search(query)} />
      </ClientOnly>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Environment-Aware Storage

```tsx
const storage = createIsomorphicFn()
  .server((key: string) => {
    // Server: File-based cache
    const fs = require("node:fs");
    return JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(".cache", "utf-8"))[key];
  })
  .client((key: string) => {
    // Client: localStorage
    return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key) || "null");
  });
```

---

## Common Problems

### Environment Variable Exposure

```tsx
// ❌ Exposes to client bundle
const apiKey = process.env.SECRET_KEY;

// ✅ Server-only access
const apiKey = serverOnly(() => process.env.SECRET_KEY);
```

### Incorrect Loader Assumptions

```tsx
// ❌ Assuming loader is server-only
export const Route = createFileRoute("/users")({
  loader: () => {
    // This runs on BOTH server and client!
    const secret = process.env.SECRET; // Exposed to client
    return fetch(`/api/users?key=${secret}`);
  },
});

// ✅ Use server function for server-only operations
const getUsersSecurely = createServerFn().handler(() => {
  const secret = process.env.SECRET; // Server-only
  return fetch(`/api/users?key=${secret}`);
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/users")({
  loader: () => getUsersSecurely(), // Isomorphic call to server function
});
```

### Hydration Mismatches

```tsx
// ❌ Different content server vs client
function CurrentTime() {
  return <div>{new Date().toLocaleString()}</div>;
}

// ✅ Consistent rendering
function CurrentTime() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState<string>();

  useEffect(() => {
    setTime(new Date().toLocaleString());
  }, []);

  return <div>{time || "Loading..."}</div>;
}
```

---

## Production Checklist

- [ ] **Bundle Analysis**: Verify server-only code isn't in client bundle
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Ensure secrets use `serverOnly()` or `createServerFn()`
- [ ] **Loader Logic**: Remember loaders are isomorphic, not server-only
- [ ] **ClientOnly Fallbacks**: Provide appropriate fallbacks to prevent layout shift
- [ ] **Error Boundaries**: Handle server/client execution errors gracefully

title: Authentication
---

<!-- We need some placeholder content here for authentication. One of our partners, Clerk, should get preferential treatment as the "preferred" way of doing auth with TanStack, but we'll support any and all other authentication providers and strategies. Write some general authentication content here until we have docs for both Clerk and other auth providers: -->

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. This is a critical part of any application that requires users to log in or access protected resources. TanStack Start provides the necessary full-stack APIs to implement authentication in your application.

## What should I use?

TanStack Start is **designed to work with any authentication provider**, so if you already have an authentication provider or strategy in mind, you can use either find an existing example or implement your own authentication logic using the full-stack APIs provided by TanStack Start.

That said, authentication is not something to be taken lightly. After much vetting, usage and reviewing on our end, we highly recommend using [Clerk](https://clerk.dev) for the best possible authentication experience. Clerk provides a full suite of authentication APIs and UI components that make it easy to implement authentication in your application and provide a seamless user experience.

<file path="docs/tanstack-start/framework/react/build-from-scratch.md">

id: build-from-scratch
title: Build a Project from Scratch
---

> [!NOTE]
> If you chose to quick start with an example or cloned project, you can skip this guide and move on to the [Learn the Basics](../learn-the-basics.md) guide.

_So you want to build a TanStack Start project from scratch?_

This guide will help you build a **very** basic TanStack Start web application. Together, we will use TanStack Start to:

- Serve an index page...
- Which displays a counter...
- With a button to increment the counter persistently.

[Here is what that will look like](https://stackblitz.com/github/tanstack/router/tree/main/examples/react/start-counter)

Let's create a new project directory and initialize it.

```shell
mkdir myApp
cd myApp
npm init -y
```

> [!NOTE] > We use `npm` in all of these examples, but you can use your package manager of choice instead.

## TypeScript Configuration

We highly recommend using TypeScript with TanStack Start. Create a `tsconfig.json` file with at least the following settings:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "target": "ES2022",
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE] > Enabling `verbatimModuleSyntax` can result in server bundles leaking into client bundles. It is recommended to keep this option disabled.

## Install Dependencies

TanStack Start is powered by [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) and requires them as dependencies.

To install them, run:

```shell
npm i @tanstack/react-start @tanstack/react-router vite
```

You'll also need React:

```shell
npm i react react-dom
```

and some TypeScript:

```shell
npm i -D typescript @types/react @types/react-dom vite-tsconfig-paths @vitejs/plugin-react
```

## Update Configuration Files

We'll then update our `package.json` to use Vite's CLI and set `"type": "module"`:

```json
{
  // ...
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite dev",
    "build": "vite build"
  }
}
```

Then configure TanStack Start's Vite plugin in `vite.config.ts`:

> [!NOTE]
> TanStack Start will stop auto-configuring React/Solid Vite plugins. You’ll get full control - choose `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `@vitejs/plugin-react-oxc`, etc. Set `customViteReactPlugin: true` to opt in to this feature right now!

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import tsConfigPaths from "vite-tsconfig-paths";
import { tanstackStart } from "@tanstack/react-start/plugin/vite";
import viteReact from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    port: 3000,
  },
  plugins: [tsConfigPaths(), tanstackStart({ customViteReactPlugin: true }), viteReact()],
});
```

## Add the Basic Templating

There are 2 required files for TanStack Start usage:

1. The router configuration
2. The root of your application

Once configuration is done, we'll have a file tree that looks like the following:

```
.
├── src/
│   ├── routes/
│   │   └── `__root.tsx`
│   ├── `router.tsx`
│   ├── `routeTree.gen.ts`
├── `.gitignore`
├── `vite.config.ts`
├── `package.json`
└── `tsconfig.json`
```

## The Router Configuration

This is the file that will dictate the behavior of TanStack Router used within Start. Here, you can configure everything
from the default [preloading functionality](/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/preloading) to [caching staleness](/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-loading).

> [!NOTE]
> You won't have a `routeTree.gen.ts` file yet. This file will be generated when you run TanStack Start for the first time.

```tsx
// src/router.tsx
import { createRouter as createTanStackRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

export function createRouter() {
  const router = createTanStackRouter({
    routeTree,
    scrollRestoration: true,
  });

  return router;
}

declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
  interface Register {
    router: ReturnType<typeof createRouter>;
  }
}
```

## The Root of Your Application

Finally, we need to create the root of our application. This is the entry point for all other routes. The code in this file will wrap all other routes in the application.

```tsx
// src/routes/__root.tsx
/// <reference types="vite/client" />
import type { ReactNode } from "react";
import { Outlet, createRootRoute, HeadContent, Scripts } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  head: () => ({
    meta: [
      {
        charSet: "utf-8",
      },
      {
        name: "viewport",
        content: "width=device-width, initial-scale=1",
      },
      {
        title: "TanStack Start Starter",
      },
    ],
  }),
  component: RootComponent,
});

function RootComponent() {
  return (
    <RootDocument>
      <Outlet />
    </RootDocument>
  );
}

function RootDocument({ children }: Readonly<{ children: ReactNode }>) {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <HeadContent />
      </head>
      <body>
        {children}
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Writing Your First Route

Now that we have the basic templating setup, we can write our first route. This is done by creating a new file in the `src/routes` directory.

```tsx
// src/routes/index.tsx
import * as fs from "node:fs";
import { createFileRoute, useRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

const filePath = "count.txt";

async function readCount() {
  return parseInt(await fs.promises.readFile(filePath, "utf-8").catch(() => "0"));
}

const getCount = createServerFn({
  method: "GET",
}).handler(() => {
  return readCount();
});

const updateCount = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
  .validator((d: number) => d)
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    const count = await readCount();
    await fs.promises.writeFile(filePath, `${count + data}`);
  });

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  component: Home,
  loader: async () => await getCount(),
});

function Home() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const state = Route.useLoaderData();

  return (
    <button
      type="button"
      onClick={() => {
        updateCount({ data: 1 }).then(() => {
          router.invalidate();
        });
      }}
    >
      Add 1 to {state}?
    </button>
  );
}
```

That's it! 🤯 You've now set up a TanStack Start project and written your first route. 🎉

You can now run `npm run dev` to start your server and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your route in action.

id: databases
title: Databases
---

Databases are at the core of any dynamic application, providing the necessary infrastructure to store, retrieve, and manage data. TanStack Start makes it easy to integrate with a variety of databases, offering a flexible approach to managing your application's data layer.

## What should I use?

TanStack Start is **designed to work with any database provider**, so if you already have a preferred database system, you can integrate it with TanStack Start using the provided full-stack APIs. Whether you're working with SQL, NoSQL, or other types of databases, TanStack Start can handle your needs.

## How simple is it to use a database with TanStack Start?

Using a database with TanStack Start is as simple as calling into your database's adapter/client/driver/service from a TanStack Start server function or server route.

Here's an abstract example of how you might connect with a database and read/write to it:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

const db = createMyDatabaseClient();

export const getUser = createServerFn(async ({ ctx }) => {
  const user = await db.getUser(ctx.userId);
  return user;
});

export const createUser = createServerFn(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
  const user = await db.createUser(input);
  return user;
});
```

This is obviously contrived, but it demonstrates that you can use literally any database provider with TanStack Start as long as you can call into it from a server function or server route.

## Recommended Database Providers

While TanStack Start is designed to work with any database provider, we highly recommend considering one of our vetted partner database providers [Neon](https://neon.tech?utm_source=tanstack) or [Convex](https://convex.dev?utm_source=tanstack). They have been vetted by TanStack to match our quality, openness, and performance standards and are both excellent choices for your database needs.

## Deployment

> [!WARNING]
> The page is still a work in progress. We'll keep updating this page with guides on deployment to different hosting providers soon!

When a TanStack Start application is being deployed, the `target` value in the TanStack Start Vite plugin in the`vite.config.ts` file determines the deployment target. The deployment target can be set to one of the following values:

- [`netlify`](#netlify): Deploy to Netlify
- [`vercel`](#vercel): Deploy to Vercel
- [`cloudflare-pages`](#cloudflare-pages): Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
- [`node-server`](#nodejs): Deploy to a Node.js server
- [`bun`](#bun): Deploy to a Bun server
- ... and more to come!

Once you've chosen a deployment target, you can follow the deployment guidelines below to deploy your TanStack Start application to the hosting provider of your choice.

### Netlify

Set the `target` value to `'netlify'` in the TanStack Start Vite plugin in `vite.config.ts` file.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { tanstackStart } from "@tanstack/react-start/plugin/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tanstackStart({ target: "netlify" })],
});
```

Deploy your application to Netlify using their one-click deployment process, and you're ready to go!

### Vercel

Set the `target` value to `'vercel'` in the TanStack Start Vite plugin in `vite.config.ts` file.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { tanstackStart } from "@tanstack/react-start/plugin/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tanstackStart({ target: "vercel" })],
});
```

Deploy your application to Vercel using their one-click deployment process, and you're ready to go!

### Cloudflare Workers

When deploying to Cloudflare Workers, you'll need to complete a few extra steps before your users can start using your app.

1. Update `vite.config.ts`

Set the `target` value to `cloudflare-module` in your `vite.config.ts` file.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { tanstackStart } from "@tanstack/react-start/plugin/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tanstackStart({ target: "cloudflare-module" })],
});
```

2. Add a `wrangler.toml` config file

```toml
# wrangler.toml
name = "your-cloudflare-project-name"
main = "./.output/server/index.mjs"
compatibility_date = "2025-04-01"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

[assets]
binding = "ASSETS"
directory = "./.output/public"
```

Deploy your application to Cloudflare Workers using their one-click deployment process, and you're ready to go!

### Node.js

Set the `target` value to `node-server` in your `vite.config.ts` file.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { tanstackStart } from "@tanstack/react-start/plugin/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tanstackStart({ target: "node-server" })],
});
```

Then you can run the following command to build and start your application:

```sh
npm run build
```

You're now ready to deploy your application to a Node.js server. You can start your application by running:

```sh
node .output/server/index.mjs
```

### Bun

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, the Bun specific deployment guidelines only work with React 19. If you are using React 18, please refer to the [Node.js](#nodejs) deployment guidelines.

Make sure that your `react` and `react-dom` packages are set to version 19.0.0 or higher in your `package.json` file. If not, run the following command to upgrade the packages:

```sh
npm install react@rc react-dom@rc
```

Set the `target` value to `bun` in your `vite.config.ts` file.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { tanstackStart } from "@tanstack/react-start/plugin/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tanstackStart({ target: "bun" })],
});
```

Then you can run the following command to build and start your application:

```sh
bun run build
```

You're now ready to deploy your application to a Bun server. You can start your application by running:

```sh
bun run .output/server/index.mjs
```

<file path="docs/tanstack-start/framework/react/learn-the-basics.md">
---
id: learn-the-basics
title: Learn the Basics
---

This guide will help you learn the basics behind how TanStack Start works, regardless of how you set up your project.

## Dependencies

TanStack Start is powered by [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router).

- **TanStack Router**: A router for building web applications.
- **Vite**: A build tool for bundling your application.

## It all "Starts" with the Router

This is the file that will dictate the behavior of TanStack Router used within Start. Here, you can configure everything
from the default [preloading functionality](/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/preloading) to [caching staleness](/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-loading).

```tsx
// src/router.tsx
import { createRouter as createTanStackRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

export function createRouter() {
  const router = createTanStackRouter({
    routeTree,
    scrollRestoration: true,
  });

  return router;
}

declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
  interface Register {
    router: ReturnType<typeof createRouter>;
  }
}
```

- Notice the `scrollRestoration` property. This is used to restore the scroll position of the page when navigating between routes.

## Route Generation

The `routeTree.gen.ts` file is generated when you run TanStack Start (via `npm run dev` or `npm run start`) for the first time. This file contains the generated route tree and a handful of TS utilities that make TanStack Start fully type-safe.

## The Server Entry Point (Optional)

> [!NOTE]
> The server entry point is **optional** out of the box. If not provided, TanStack Start will automatically handle the server entry point for you using the below as a default.

This is done via the `src/server.ts` file:

```tsx
// src/server.ts
import { createStartHandler, defaultStreamHandler } from "@tanstack/react-start/server";
import { createRouter } from "./router";

export default createStartHandler({
  createRouter,
})(defaultStreamHandler);
```

Whether we are statically generating our app or serving it dynamically, the `server.ts` file is the entry point for doing all SSR-related work.

- It's important that a new router is created for each request. This ensures that any data handled by the router is unique to the request.
- The `defaultStreamHandler` function is used to render our application to a stream, allowing us to take advantage of streaming HTML to the client. (This is the default handler, but you can also use other handlers like `defaultRenderHandler`, or even build your own)

## The Client Entry Point (Optional)

> [!NOTE]
> The client entry point is **optional** out of the box. If not provided, TanStack Start will automatically handle the client entry point for you using the below as a default.

Getting our html to the client is only half the battle. Once there, we need to hydrate our client-side JavaScript once the route resolves to the client. We do this by hydrating the root of our application with the `StartClient` component:

```tsx
// src/client.tsx
import { StartClient } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { hydrateRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { createRouter } from "./router";

const router = createRouter();

hydrateRoot(
  document,
  <StrictMode>
    <StartClient router={router} />
  </StrictMode>,
);
```

This enables us to kick off client-side routing once the user's initial server request has fulfilled.

## The Root of Your Application

Other than the client entry point (which is optional by default), the `__root` route of your application is the entry point for your application. The code in this file will wrap all other routes in the app, including your home page. It behaves like a pathless layout route for your whole application.

Because it is **always rendered**, it is the perfect place to construct your application shell and take care of any global logic.

```tsx
// src/routes/__root.tsx
import { Outlet, createRootRoute, HeadContent, Scripts } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import type { ReactNode } from "react";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  head: () => ({
    meta: [
      {
        charSet: "utf-8",
      },
      {
        name: "viewport",
        content: "width=device-width, initial-scale=1",
      },
      {
        title: "TanStack Start Starter",
      },
    ],
  }),
  component: RootComponent,
});

function RootComponent() {
  return (
    <RootDocument>
      <Outlet />
    </RootDocument>
  );
}

function RootDocument({ children }: Readonly<{ children: ReactNode }>) {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <HeadContent />
      </head>
      <body>
        {children}
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

- This layout may change in the future as we roll out SPA mode, which allows the root route to render the SPA shell without any page-specific content.
- Notice the `Scripts` component. This is used to load all of the client-side JavaScript for the application.

## Routes

Routes are an extensive feature of TanStack Router, and are covered thoroughly in the [Routing Guide](/router/latest/docs/framework/react/routing/file-based-routing). As a summary:

- Routes are defined using the `createFileRoute` function.
- Routes are automatically code-split and lazy-loaded.
- Critical data fetching is coordinated from a Route's loader
- Much more!

```tsx
// src/routes/index.tsx
import * as fs from "node:fs";
import { createFileRoute, useRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

const filePath = "count.txt";

async function readCount() {
  return parseInt(await fs.promises.readFile(filePath, "utf-8").catch(() => "0"));
}

const getCount = createServerFn({
  method: "GET",
}).handler(() => {
  return readCount();
});

const updateCount = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
  .validator((d: number) => d)
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    const count = await readCount();
    await fs.promises.writeFile(filePath, `${count + data}`);
  });

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  component: Home,
  loader: async () => await getCount(),
});

function Home() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const state = Route.useLoaderData();

  return (
    <button
      type="button"
      onClick={() => {
        updateCount({ data: 1 }).then(() => {
          router.invalidate();
        });
      }}
    >
      Add 1 to {state}?
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Navigation

TanStack Start builds 100% on top of TanStack Router, so all of the navigation features of TanStack Router are available to you. In summary:

- Use the `Link` component to navigate to a new route.
- Use the `useNavigate` hook to navigate imperatively.
- Use the `useRouter` hook anywhere in your application to access the router instance and perform invalidations.
- Every router hook that returns state is reactive, meaning it will automatically re-run when the appropriate state changes.

Here's a quick example of how you can use the `Link` component to navigate to a new route:

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";

function Home() {
  return <Link to="/about">About</Link>;
}
```

For more in-depth information on navigation, check out the [navigation guide](/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/navigation).

## Server Functions (RPCs)

You may have noticed the **server function** we created above using `createServerFn`. This is one of TanStack's most powerful features, allowing you to create server-side functions that can be called from both the server during SSR and the client!

Here's a quick overview of how server functions work:

- Server functions are created using the `createServerFn` function.
- They can be called from both the server during SSR and the client.
- They can be used to fetch data from the server, or to perform other server-side actions.

Here's a quick example of how you can use server functions to fetch and return data from the server:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import * as fs from "node:fs";
import { z } from "zod";

const getUserById = createServerFn({ method: "GET" })
  // Always validate data sent to the function, here we use Zod
  .validator(z.string())
  // The handler function is where you perform the server-side logic
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    return db.query.users.findFirst({ where: eq(users.id, data) });
  });

// Somewhere else in your application
const user = await getUserById({ data: "1" });
```

To learn more about server functions, check out the [server functions guide](../server-functions).

### Mutations

Server Functions can also be used to perform mutations on the server. This is also done using the same `createServerFn` function, but with the additional requirement that you invalidate any data on the client that was affected by the mutation.

- If you're using TanStack Router only, you can use the `router.invalidate()` method to invalidate all router data and re-fetch it.
- If you're using TanStack Query, you can use the `queryClient.invalidateQueries()` method to invalidate data, among other more specific methods to target specific queries.

Here's a quick example of how you can use server functions to perform a mutation on the server and invalidate the data on the client:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { z } from "zod";
import { dbUpdateUser } from "...";

const UserSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  name: z.string(),
});
export type User = z.infer<typeof UserSchema>;

export const updateUser = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
  .validator(UserSchema)
  .handler(({ data }) => dbUpdateUser(data));

// Somewhere else in your application
import { useQueryClient } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { useRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { useServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { updateUser, type User } from "...";

export function useUpdateUser() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  const _updateUser = useServerFn(updateUser);

  return useCallback(
    async (user: User) => {
      const result = await _updateUser({ data: user });

      router.invalidate();
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({
        queryKey: ["users", "updateUser", user.id],
      });

      return result;
    },
    [router, queryClient, _updateUser],
  );
}

// Somewhere else in your application
import { useUpdateUser } from "...";

function MyComponent() {
  const updateUser = useUpdateUser();
  const onClick = useCallback(async () => {
    await updateUser({ id: "1", name: "John" });
    console.log("Updated user");
  }, [updateUser]);

  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click Me</button>;
}
```

To learn more about mutations, check out the [mutations guide](/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-mutations).

## Data Loading

Another powerful feature of TanStack Router is data loading. This allows you to fetch data for SSR and preload route data before it is rendered. This is done using the `loader` function of a route.

Here's a quick overview of how data loading works:

- Data loading is done using the `loader` function of a route.
- Data loaders are **isomorphic**, meaning they are executed on both the server and the client.
- For performing server-only logic, call a server function from within the loader.
- Similar to TanStack Query, data loaders are cached on the client and are re-used and even re-fetched in the background when the data is stale.

To learn more about data loading, check out the [data loading guide](/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-loading).

id: middleware
title: Middleware
---

## What is Server Function Middleware?

Middleware allows you to customize the behavior of server functions created with `createServerFn` with things like shared validation, context, and much more. Middleware can even depend on other middleware to create a chain of operations that are executed hierarchically and in order.

## What kinds of things can I do with Middleware in my Server Functions?

- **Authentication**: Verify a user's identity before executing a server function.
- **Authorization**: Check if a user has the necessary permissions to execute a server function.
- **Logging**: Log requests, responses, and errors.
- **Observability**: Collect metrics, traces, and logs.
- **Provide Context**: Attach data to the request object for use in other middleware or server functions.
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors in a consistent way.
- And many more! The possibilities are up to you!

## Defining Middleware for Server Functions

Middleware is defined using the `createMiddleware` function. This function returns a `Middleware` object that can be used to continue customizing the middleware with methods like `middleware`, `validator`, `server`, and `client`.

```tsx
import { createMiddleware } from "@tanstack/react-start";

const loggingMiddleware = createMiddleware({ type: "function" }).server(
  async ({ next, data }) => {
    console.log("Request received:", data);
    const result = await next();
    console.log("Response processed:", result);
    return result;
  },
);
```

## Using Middleware in Your Server Functions

Once you've defined your middleware, you can use it in combination with the `createServerFn` function to customize the behavior of your server functions.

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { loggingMiddleware } from "./middleware";

const fn = createServerFn()
  .middleware([loggingMiddleware])
  .handler(async () => {
    // ...
  });
```

## Middleware Methods

Several methods are available to customize the middleware. If you are (hopefully) using TypeScript, the order of these methods is enforced by the type system to ensure maximum inference and type safety.

- `middleware`: Add a middleware to the chain.
- `validator`: Modify the data object before it is passed to this middleware and any nested middleware.
- `server`: Define server-side logic that the middleware will execute before any nested middleware and ultimately a server function, and also provide the result to the next middleware.
- `client`: Define client-side logic that the middleware will execute before any nested middleware and ultimately the client-side RPC function (or the server-side function), and also provide the result to the next middleware.

## The `middleware` method

The `middleware` method is used to dependency middleware to the chain that will executed **before** the current middleware. Just call the `middleware` method with an array of middleware objects.

```tsx
import { createMiddleware } from "@tanstack/react-start";

const loggingMiddleware = createMiddleware({ type: "function" }).middleware([
  authMiddleware,
  loggingMiddleware,
]);
```

Type-safe context and payload validation are also inherited from parent middlewares!

## The `validator` method

The `validator` method is used to modify the data object before it is passed to this middleware, nested middleware, and ultimately the server function. This method should receive a function that takes the data object and returns a validated (and optionally modified) data object. It's common to use a validation library like `zod` to do this. Here is an example:

```tsx
import { createMiddleware } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { zodValidator } from "@tanstack/zod-adapter";
import { z } from "zod";

const mySchema = z.object({
  workspaceId: z.string(),
});

const workspaceMiddleware = createMiddleware({ type: "function" })
  .validator(zodValidator(mySchema))
  .server(({ next, data }) => {
    console.log("Workspace ID:", data.workspaceId);
    return next();
  });
```

## The `server` method

The `server` method is used to define **server-side** logic that the middleware will execute both before and after any nested middleware and ultimately a server function. This method receives an object with the following properties:

- `next`: A function that, when called, will execute the next middleware in the chain.
- `data`: The data object that was passed to the server function.
- `context`: An object that stores data from parent middleware. It can be extended with additional data that will be passed to child middleware.

## Returning the required result from `next`

The `next` function is used to execute the next middleware in the chain. **You must await and return (or return directly) the result of the `next` function provided to you** for the chain to continue executing.

```tsx
import { createMiddleware } from "@tanstack/react-start";

const loggingMiddleware = createMiddleware({ type: "function" }).server(
  async ({ next }) => {
    console.log("Request received");
    const result = await next();
    console.log("Response processed");
    return result;
  },
);
```

## Providing context to the next middleware via `next`

The `next` function can be optionally called with an object that has a `context` property with an object value. Whatever properties you pass to this `context` value will be merged into the parent `context` and provided to the next middleware.

```tsx
import { createMiddleware } from "@tanstack/react-start";

const awesomeMiddleware = createMiddleware({ type: "function" }).server(({ next }) => {
  return next({
    context: {
      isAwesome: Math.random() > 0.5,
    },
  });
});

const loggingMiddleware = createMiddleware({ type: "function" })
  .middleware([awesomeMiddleware])
  .server(async ({ next, context }) => {
    console.log("Is awesome?", context.isAwesome);
    return next();
  });
```

## Client-Side Logic

Despite server functions being mostly server-side bound operations, there is still plenty of client-side logic surrounding the outgoing RPC request from the client. This means that we can also define client-side logic in middleware that will execute on the client side around any nested middleware and ultimately the RPC function and its response to the client.

## Client-side Payload Validation

By default, middleware validation is only performed on the server to keep the client bundle size small. However, you may also choose to validate data on the client side by passing the `validateClient: true` option to the `createMiddleware` function. This will cause the data to be validated on the client side before being sent to the server, potentially saving a round trip.

> Why can't I pass a different validation schema for the client?
>
> The client-side validation schema is derived from the server-side schema. This is because the client-side validation schema is used to validate the data before it is sent to the server. If the client-side schema were different from the server-side schema, the server would receive data that it did not expect, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

```tsx
import { createMiddleware } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { zodValidator } from "@tanstack/zod-adapter";
import { z } from "zod";

const workspaceMiddleware = createMiddleware({ validateClient: true })
  .validator(zodValidator(mySchema))
  .server(({ next, data }) => {
    console.log("Workspace ID:", data.workspaceId);
    return next();
  });
```

## The `client` method

Client middleware logic is defined using the `client` method on a `Middleware` object. This method is used to define client-side logic that the middleware will execute both before and after any nested middleware and ultimately the client-side RPC function (or the server-side function if you're doing SSR or calling this function from another server function).

**Client-side middleware logic shares much of the same API as logic created with the `server` method, but it is executed on the client side.** This includes:

- Requiring the `next` function to be called to continue the chain.
- The ability to provide context to the next client middleware via the `next` function.
- The ability to modify the data object before it is passed to the next client middleware.

Similar to the `server` function, it also receives an object with the following properties:

- `next`: A function that, when called, will execute the next client middleware in the chain.
- `data`: The data object that was passed to the client function.
- `context`: An object that stores data from parent middleware. It can be extended with additional data that will be passed to child middleware.

```tsx
const loggingMiddleware = createMiddleware({ type: "function" }).client(
  async ({ next }) => {
    console.log("Request sent");
    const result = await next();
    console.log("Response received");
    return result;
  },
);
```

## Sending client context to the server

**Client context is NOT sent to the server by default since this could end up unintentionally sending large payloads to the server.** If you need to send client context to the server, you must call the `next` function with a `sendContext` property and object to transmit any data to the server. Any properties passed to `sendContext` will be merged, serialized and sent to the server along with the data and will be available on the normal context object of any nested server middleware.

```tsx
const requestLogger = createMiddleware({ type: "function" })
  .client(async ({ next, context }) => {
    return next({
      sendContext: {
        // Send the workspace ID to the server
        workspaceId: context.workspaceId,
      },
    });
  })
  .server(async ({ next, data, context }) => {
    // Woah! We have the workspace ID from the client!
    console.log("Workspace ID:", context.workspaceId);
    return next();
  });
```

## Client-Sent Context Security

You may have noticed that in the example above that while client-sent context is type-safe, it is is not required to be validated at runtime. If you pass dynamic user-generated data via context, that could pose a security concern, so **if you are sending dynamic data from the client to the server via context, you should validate it in the server-side middleware before using it.** Here's an example:

```tsx
import { zodValidator } from "@tanstack/zod-adapter";
import { z } from "zod";

const requestLogger = createMiddleware({ type: "function" })
  .client(async ({ next, context }) => {
    return next({
      sendContext: {
        workspaceId: context.workspaceId,
      },
    });
  })
  .server(async ({ next, data, context }) => {
    // Validate the workspace ID before using it
    const workspaceId = zodValidator(z.number()).parse(context.workspaceId);
    console.log("Workspace ID:", workspaceId);
    return next();
  });
```

## Sending server context to the client

Similar to sending client context to the server, you can also send server context to the client by calling the `next` function with a `sendContext` property and object to transmit any data to the client. Any properties passed to `sendContext` will be merged, serialized and sent to the client along with the response and will be available on the normal context object of any nested client middleware. The returned object of calling `next` in `client` contains the context sent from server to the client and is type-safe. Middleware is able to infer the context sent from the server to the client from previous middleware chained from the `middleware` function.

> [!WARNING]
> The return type of `next` in `client` can only be inferred from middleware known in the current middleware chain. Therefore the most accurate return type of `next` is in middleware at the end of the middleware chain

```tsx
const serverTimer = createMiddleware({ type: "function" }).server(async ({ next }) => {
  return next({
    sendContext: {
      // Send the current time to the client
      timeFromServer: new Date(),
    },
  });
});

const requestLogger = createMiddleware({ type: "function" })
  .middleware([serverTimer])
  .client(async ({ next }) => {
    const result = await next();
    // Woah! We have the time from the server!
    console.log("Time from the server:", result.context.timeFromServer);

    return result;
  });
```

## Reading/Modifying the Server Response

Middleware that uses the `server` method executes in the same context as server functions, so you can follow the exact same [Server Function Context Utilities](../server-functions.md#server-function-context) to read and modify anything about the request headers, status codes, etc.

## Modifying the Client Request

Middleware that uses the `client` method executes in a **completely different client-side context** than server functions, so you can't use the same utilities to read and modify the request. However, you can still modify the request returning additional properties when calling the `next` function. Currently supported properties are:

- `headers`: An object containing headers to be added to the request.

Here's an example of adding an `Authorization` header any request using this middleware:

```tsx
import { getToken } from "my-auth-library";

const authMiddleware = createMiddleware({ type: "function" }).client(async ({ next }) => {
  return next({
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${getToken()}`,
    },
  });
});
```

## Using Middleware

Middleware can be used in two different ways:

- **Global Middleware**: Middleware that should be executed for every request.
- **Server Function Middleware**: Middleware that should be executed for a specific server function.

## Global Middleware

Global middleware runs automatically for every server function in your application. This is useful for functionality like authentication, logging, and monitoring that should apply to all requests.

To use global middleware, create a `global-middleware.ts` file in your project (typically at `app/global-middleware.ts`). This file runs in both client and server environments and is where you register global middleware.

Here's how to register global middleware:

```tsx
// app/global-middleware.ts
import { registerGlobalMiddleware } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { authMiddleware } from "./middleware";

registerGlobalMiddleware({
  middleware: [authMiddleware],
});
```

### Global Middleware Type Safety

Global middleware types are inherently **detached** from server functions themselves. This means that if a global middleware supplies additional context to server functions or other server function specific middleware, the types will not be automatically passed through to the server function or other server function specific middleware.

```tsx
// app/global-middleware.ts
registerGlobalMiddleware({
  middleware: [authMiddleware],
});
```

```tsx
// authMiddleware.ts
const authMiddleware = createMiddleware({ type: "function" }).server(
  ({ next, context }) => {
    console.log(context.user); // <-- This will not be typed!
    // ...
  },
);
```

To solve this, add the global middleware you are trying to reference to the server function's middleware array. **The global middleware will be deduped to a single entry (the global instance), and your server function will receive the correct types.**

Here's an example of how this works:

```tsx
import { authMiddleware } from "./authMiddleware";

const fn = createServerFn()
  .middleware([authMiddleware])
  .handler(async ({ context }) => {
    console.log(context.user);
    // ...
  });
```

## Middleware Execution Order

Middleware is executed dependency-first, starting with global middleware, followed by server function middleware. The following example will log the following in this order:

- `globalMiddleware1`
- `globalMiddleware2`
- `a`
- `b`
- `c`
- `d`

```tsx
const globalMiddleware1 = createMiddleware({ type: "function" }).server(
  async ({ next }) => {
    console.log("globalMiddleware1");
    return next();
  },
);

const globalMiddleware2 = createMiddleware({ type: "function" }).server(
  async ({ next }) => {
    console.log("globalMiddleware2");
    return next();
  },
);

registerGlobalMiddleware({
  middleware: [globalMiddleware1, globalMiddleware2],
});

const a = createMiddleware({ type: "function" }).server(async ({ next }) => {
  console.log("a");
  return next();
});

const b = createMiddleware({ type: "function" })
  .middleware([a])
  .server(async ({ next }) => {
    console.log("b");
    return next();
  });

const c = createMiddleware({ type: "function" })
  .middleware()
  .server(async ({ next }) => {
    console.log("c");
    return next();
  });

const d = createMiddleware({ type: "function" })
  .middleware([b, c])
  .server(async () => {
    console.log("d");
  });

const fn = createServerFn()
  .middleware([d])
  .server(async () => {
    console.log("fn");
  });
```

## Environment Tree Shaking

Middleware functionality is tree-shaken based on the environment for each bundle produced.

- On the server, nothing is tree-shaken, so all code used in middleware will be included in the server bundle.
- On the client, all server-specific code is removed from the client bundle. This means any code used in the `server` method is always removed from the client bundle. If `validateClient` is set to `true`, the client-side validation code will be included in the client bundle, otherwise `data` validation code will also be removed.

id: migrate-from-next-js
title: Migrate from Next.js
---

This guide provides a step-by-step process to migrate a project from the Next.js App Router to **TanStack Start**. We respect the powerful features of Next.js and aim to make this transition as smooth as possible.

## Step-by-Step (Basics)

This step-by-step guide provides an overview of how to migrate your Next.js App Router project to TanStack Start. The goal is to help you understand the basic steps involved in the migration process so you can adapt them to your specific project needs.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, this guide assumes your project structure looks like this:

```txt
├── next.config.ts
├── package.json
├── postcss.config.mjs
├── public
│   ├── file.svg
│   ├── globe.svg
│   ├── next.svg
│   ├── vercel.svg
│   └── window.svg
├── README.md
├── src
│   └── app
│       ├── favicon.ico
│       ├── globals.css
│       ├── layout.tsx
│       └── page.tsx
└── tsconfig.json
```

Alternatively, you can follow along by cloning the following [starter template](https://github.com/nrjdalal/awesome-templates/tree/main/next.js-apps/next.js-start):

```sh
npx gitpick nrjdalal/awesome-templates/tree/main/next.js-apps/next.js-start next.js-start-er
```

This structure is a basic Next.js application using the App Router, which we will migrate to TanStack Start.

### 1. Remove Next.js

First, uninstall Next.js and remove related configuration files:

```sh
npm uninstall @tailwindcss/postcss next
rm postcss.config.* next.config.*
```

### 2. Install Required Dependencies

TanStack Start leverages [Vite](https://vite.dev) and TanStack Router:

```sh
npm i @tanstack/react-router @tanstack/react-start vite
```

For Tailwind CSS and resolving imports using path aliases:

```sh
npm i -D @tailwindcss/vite tailwindcss vite-tsconfig-paths
```

### 3. Update Project Configuration

Now that you've installed the necessary dependencies, update your project configuration files to work with TanStack Start.

- `package.json`

```json
{
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite dev",
    "build": "vite build",
    "start": "node .output/server/index.mjs"
  }
}
```

- `vite.config.ts`

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";
import { tanstackStart } from "@tanstack/react-start/plugin/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import tsconfigPaths from "vite-tsconfig-paths";

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    port: 3000,
  },
  plugins: [
    tailwindcss(),
    // Enables Vite to resolve imports using path aliases.
    tsconfigPaths(),
    tanstackStart({
      tsr: {
        // Specifies the directory TanStack Router uses for your routes.
        routesDirectory: "src/app", // Defaults to "src/routes"
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

By default, `routesDirectory` is set to `src/routes`. To maintain consistency with Next.js App Router conventions, you can set it to `src/app` instead.

### 4. Adapt the Root Layout

> TanStack Start uses a routing approach similar to Remix, with some changes to support nested structures and special features using tokens. Learn more about it at [Routing Concepts](/router/latest/docs/framework/react/routing/routing-concepts) guide.

Instead of `layout.tsx`, create a file named `__root.tsx` in the `src/app` directory. This file will serve as the root layout for your application.

- `src/app/layout.tsx` to `src/app/__root.tsx`

```tsx
- import type { Metadata } from "next" // [!code --]
import {
  Outlet,
  createRootRoute,
  HeadContent,
  Scripts,
} from "@tanstack/react-router"
import "./globals.css"

- export const metadata: Metadata = { // [!code --]
-   title: "Create Next App", // [!code --]
-   description: "Generated by create next app", // [!code --]
- } // [!code --]
export const Route = createRootRoute({
  head: () => ({
    meta: [
      { charSet: "utf-8" },
      {
        name: "viewport",
        content: "width=device-width, initial-scale=1",
      },
      { title: "TanStack Start Starter" }
    ],
  }),
  component: RootLayout,
})

- export default function RootLayout({ // [!code --]
-   children, // [!code --]
- }: Readonly<{ // [!code --]
-   children: React.ReactNode // [!code --]
- }>) { // [!code --]
-   return ( // [!code --]
-     <html lang="en"> // [!code --]
-       <body>{children}</body> // [!code --]
-     </html> // [!code --]
-   ) // [!code --]
- } // [!code --]
function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <HeadContent />
      </head>
      <body>
        <Outlet />
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

### 5. Adapt the Home Page

Instead of `page.tsx`, create an `index.tsx` file for the `/` route.

- `src/app/page.tsx` to `src/app/index.tsx`

```tsx
- export default function Home() { // [!code --]
+ export const Route = createFileRoute('/')({ // [!code ++]
+   component: Home, // [!code ++]
+ }) // [!code ++]

+ function Home() { // [!code ++]
  return (
    <main className="min-h-dvh w-screen flex items-center justify-center flex-col gap-y-4 p-4">
      <img
        className="max-w-sm w-full"
        src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanstack/tanstack.com/main/src/images/splash-dark.png"
        alt="TanStack Logo"
      />
      <h1>
        <span className="line-through">Next.js</span> TanStack Start
      </h1>
      <a
        className="bg-foreground text-background rounded-full px-4 py-1 hover:opacity-90"
        href="https://tanstack.com/start/latest"
        target="_blank"
      >
        Docs
      </a>
    </main>
  )
}
```

### 6. Are we migrated yet?

Before you can run the development server, you need to create a router file that will define the behavior of TanStack Router within TanStack Start.

- `src/router.tsx`

```tsx
import { createRouter as createTanStackRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

export function createRouter() {
  const router = createTanStackRouter({
    routeTree,
    scrollRestoration: true,
  });

  return router;
}

declare module "@tanstack/react-router" {
  interface Register {
    router: ReturnType<typeof createRouter>;
  }
}
```

> 🧠 Here you can configure everything from the default [preloading functionality](/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/preloading) to [caching staleness](/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-loading).

Don't worry if you see some TypeScript errors at this point; the next step will resolve them.

### 7. Verify the Migration

Run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Then, visit `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the TanStack Start welcome page with its logo and a documentation link.

> If you encounter issues, review the steps above and ensure that file names and paths match exactly. For a reference implementation, see the [post-migration repository](https://github.com/nrjdalal/next-to-start).

## Next Steps (Advanced)

Now that you have migrated the basic structure of your Next.js application to TanStack Start, you can explore more advanced features and concepts.

### Routing Concepts

| Route Example                  | Next.js                            | TanStack Start            |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Root Layout                    | `src/app/layout.tsx`               | `src/app/__root.tsx`      |
| `/` (Home Page)                | `src/app/page.tsx`                 | `src/app/index.tsx`       |
| `/posts` (Static Route)        | `src/app/posts/page.tsx`           | `src/app/posts.tsx`       |
| `/posts/[slug]` (Dynamic)      | `src/app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx`    | `src/app/posts/$slug.tsx` |
| `/posts/[...slug]` (Catch-All) | `src/app/posts/[...slug]/page.tsx` | `src/app/posts/$.tsx`     |
| `/api/endpoint` (API Route)    | `src/app/api/endpoint/route.ts`    | `src/app/api/endpoint.ts` |

Learn more about the [Routing Concepts](/router/latest/docs/framework/react/routing/routing-concepts).

### Dynamic and Catch-All Routes

Retrieving dynamic route parameters in TanStack Start is straightforward.

```tsx
- export default async function Page({ // [!code --]
-   params, // [!code --]
- }: { // [!code --]
-   params: Promise<{ slug: string }> // [!code --]
- }) { // [!code --]
+ export const Route = createFileRoute('/app/posts/$slug')({ // [!code ++]
+   component: Page, // [!code ++]
+ }) // [!code ++]

+ function Page() { // [!code ++]
-   const { slug } = await params // [!code --]
+   const { slug } = Route.useParams() // [!code ++]
  return <div>My Post: {slug}</div>
}
```

> Note: If you've made a catch-all route (like `src/app/posts/$.tsx`), you can access the parameters via `const { _splat } = Route.useParams()`.

Similarly, you can access `searchParams` using `const { page, filter, sort } = Route.useSearch()`.

Learn more about the [Dynamic and Catch-All Routes](/router/latest/docs/framework/react/routing/routing-concepts#dynamic-route-segments).

### Links

```tsx
- import Link from "next/link" // [!code --]
+ import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router" // [!code ++]

function Component() {
-   return <Link href="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link> // [!code --]
+   return <Link to="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link> // [!code ++]
}
```

Learn more about the [Links](../learn-the-basics.md#navigation).

### Server ~Actions~ Functions

```tsx
- 'use server' // [!code --]
+ import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start" // [!code ++]

- export const create = async () => { // [!code --]
+ export const create = createServerFn().handler(async () => { // [!code ++]
  return true
- } // [!code --]
+ }) // [!code ++]
```

Learn more about the [Server Functions](../server-functions.md).

### Server Routes ~Handlers~

```ts
- export async function GET() { // [!code --]
+ export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({ // [!code ++]
+   GET: async () => { // [!code ++]
    return Response.json("Hello, World!")
  }
+ }) // [!code ++]
```

Learn more about the [Server Routes](../server-routes.md).

### Fonts

```tsx
- import { Inter } from "next/font/google" // [!code --]

- const inter = Inter({ // [!code --]
-   subsets: ["latin"], // [!code --]
-   display: "swap", // [!code --]
- }) // [!code --]

- export default function Page() { // [!code --]
-   return <p className={inter.className}>Font Sans</p> // [!code --]
- } // [!code --]
```

Instead of `next/font`, use Tailwind CSS’s CSS-first approach. Install fonts (for example, from [Fontsource](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource)):

```sh
npm i -D @fontsource-variable/dm-sans @fontsource-variable/jetbrains-mono
```

Add the following to `src/app/globals.css`:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";

@import "@fontsource-variable/dm-sans"; /* [!code ++] */
@import "@fontsource-variable/jetbrains-mono"; /* [!code ++] */

@theme inline {
  --font-sans: "DM Sans Variable", sans-serif; /* [!code ++] */
  --font-mono: "JetBrains Mono Variable", monospace; /* [!code ++] */
  /* ... */
}

/* ... */
```

### Fetching Data

```tsx
- export default async function Page() { // [!code --]
+ export const Route = createFileRoute('/')({ // [!code ++]
+   component: Page, // [!code ++]
+   loader: async () => { // [!code ++]
+     const res = await fetch('https://api.vercel.app/blog') // [!code ++]
+     return res.json() // [!code ++]
+   }, // [!code ++]
+ }) // [!code ++]

+ function Page() { // [!code ++]
-   const data = await fetch('https://api.vercel.app/blog') // [!code --]
-   const posts = await data.json() // [!code --]
+   const posts = Route.useLoaderData() // [!code ++]

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

id: path-aliases
title: Path Aliases
---

Path aliases are a useful feature of TypeScript that allows you to define a shortcut for a path that could be distant in your project's directory structure. This can help you avoid long relative imports in your code and make it easier to refactor your project's structure. This is especially useful for avoiding long relative imports in your code.

By default, TanStack Start does not include path aliases. However, you can easily add them to your project by updating your `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your project and adding the following configuration:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "~/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we've defined the path alias `~/*` that maps to the `./src/*` directory. This means that you can now import files from the `src` directory using the `~` prefix.

After updating your `tsconfig.json` file, you'll need to install the `vite-tsconfig-paths` plugin to enable path aliases in your TanStack Start project. You can do this by running the following command:

```sh
npm install -D vite-tsconfig-paths
```

Now, you'll need to update your `app.config.ts` file to include the following:

```ts
// app.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@tanstack/react-start/config";
import viteTsConfigPaths from "vite-tsconfig-paths";

export default defineConfig({
  vite: {
    plugins: [
      // this is the plugin that enables path aliases
      viteTsConfigPaths({
        projects: ["./tsconfig.json"],
      }),
    ],
  },
});
```

Once this configuration has completed, you'll now be able to import files using the path alias like so:

```ts
// app/routes/posts/$postId/edit.tsx
import { Input } from "~/components/ui/input";

// instead of

import { Input } from "../../../components/ui/input";
```
</file>

title: Building a Full Stack DevJokes App with TanStack Start
---

This tutorial will guide you through building a complete full-stack application using TanStack Start. You'll create a DevJokesapp where users can view and add developer-themed jokes, demonstrating key concepts of TanStack Start including server functions, file-based data storage, and React components.

Here's a demo of the app in action:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zd0rtKbtlgU?si=7W1Peoo0W0WvZmAd" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The complete code for this tutorial is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/shrutikapoor08/devjokes).

## What You'll Learn

1. Setting up a TanStack Start project
2. Implementing server functions
3. Reading and writing data to files
4. Building a complete UI with React components
5. Using TanStack Router for data fetching and navigation

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of React and TypeScript.
- Node.js and `pnpm` installed on your machine

## Nice to know

- [Server Side Rendering (SSR)](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/ssr)
- [TanStack Router concepts](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/routing/routing-concepts)
- [React Query concepts](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview)

## Setting up a TanStack Start Project

First, let's create a new TanStack Start project:

```bash
pnpx create-start-app devjokes
cd devjokes
```

When this script runs, it will ask you a few setup questions. You can either pick choices that work for you or just press enter to accept the defaults.

Optionally, you can pass in a `--add-on` flag to get options such as Shadcn, Clerk, Convex, TanStack Query, etc.

Once setup is complete, install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

For this project, we'll need a few additional packages:

```bash
# Install uuid for generating unique IDs
pnpm add uuid
pnpm add -D @types/uuid
```

## Understanding the project structure

At this point, the project structure should look like this -

```
/devjokes
├── src/
│   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── __root.tsx                    # Root layout
│   │   ├── index.tsx                     # Home page
│   │   ├── demo.start.server-funcs.tsx   # Demo server functions
│   │   └── demo.start.api-request.tsx    # Demo API request
│   ├── api/                              # API endpoints
│   ├── components/                       # React components
│   ├── api.ts                            # API handler.
│   ├── client.tsx                        # Client entry point
│   ├── router.tsx                        # Router configuration
│   ├── routeTree.gen.ts                  # Generated route tree
│   ├── ssr.tsx                           # Server-side rendering
│   └── styles.css                        # Global styles
├── public/                               # Static assets
├── app.config.ts                         # TanStack Start configuration
├── package.json                          # Project dependencies
└── tsconfig.json                         # TypeScript configuration
```

This structure might seem overwhelming at first, but here are the key files you need to focus on:

1. `router.tsx` - Sets up routing for your application
2. `src/routes/__root.tsx` - The root layout component where you can add global styles and components
3. `src/routes/index.tsx` - Your home page
4. `client.tsx` - Client-side entry point
5. `ssr.tsx` - Handles server-side rendering

Once your project is set up, you can access your app at `localhost:3000`. You should see the default TanStack Start welcome page.

At this point, your app will look like this -

![TanStack Start Welcome Page After Setup](https://res.cloudinary.com/dubc3wnbv/image/upload/v1746312482/Photo-1_lpechn.png)

## Step 1: Reading Data From a File

Let's start by creating a file-based storage system for our jokes.

### Step 1.1: Create a JSON File with Jokes

Let's set up a list of jokes that we can use to render on the page. Create a `data` directory in your project root and a `jokes.json` file within it:

```bash
mkdir -p src/data
touch src/data/jokes.json
```

Now, let's add some sample jokes to this file:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "question": "Why don't keyboards sleep?",
    "answer": "Because they have two shifts"
  },
  {
    "id": "2",
    "question": "Are you a RESTful API?",
    "answer": "Because you GET my attention, PUT some love, POST the cutest smile, and DELETE my bad day"
  },
  {
    "id": "3",
    "question": "I used to know a joke about Java",
    "answer": "But I ran out of memory."
  },
  {
    "id": "4",
    "question": "Why do Front-End Developers eat lunch alone?",
    "answer": "Because, they don't know how to join tables."
  },
  {
    "id": "5",
    "question": "I am declaring a war.",
    "answer": "var war;"
  }
]
```

### Step 1.2: Create Types for Our Data

Let's create a file to define our data types. Create a new file at `src/types/index.ts`:

```typescript
// src/types/index.ts
export interface Joke {
  id: string;
  question: string;
  answer: string;
}

export type JokesData = Joke[];
```

### Step 1.3: Create Server Functions to Read the File

Let's create a new file `src/serverActions/jokesActions.ts` to create a server function to perform a read-write operation. We will be creating a server function using [`createServerFn`](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/server-functions).

```tsx
// src/serverActions/jokesActions.ts

import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import * as fs from "node:fs";
import type { JokesData } from "../types";

const JOKES_FILE = "src/data/jokes.json";

export const getJokes = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(async () => {
  const jokes = await fs.promises.readFile(JOKES_FILE, "utf-8");
  return JSON.parse(jokes) as JokesData;
});
```

In this code, we are using `createServerFn` to create a server function that reads the jokes from the JSON file. The `handler` function is where we are using the `fs` module to read the file.

### Step 1.4: Consume Server Function on the Client Side

Now to consume this server function, we can simply call it in our code using TanStack Router which already comes with TanStack Start!

Now let's create a new component `JokesList` to render the jokes on the page with a little Tailwind styling sprinkle.

```tsx
// src/components/JokesList.tsx
import { Joke } from "../types";

interface JokesListProps {
  jokes: Joke[];
}

export function JokesList({ jokes }: JokesListProps) {
  if (!jokes || jokes.length === 0) {
    return <p className="text-gray-500 italic">No jokes found. Add some!</p>;
  }

  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Jokes Collection</h2>
      {jokes.map((joke) => (
        <div
          key={joke.id}
          className="rounded-lg border border-gray-200 bg-white p-4 shadow-md"
        >
          <p className="mb-2 text-lg font-bold">{joke.question}</p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">{joke.answer}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now let's call our server function inside `App.jsx` using TanStack Router which already comes with TanStack Start!

```jsx
// App.jsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { getJokes } from "./serverActions/jokesActions";
import { JokesList } from "./JokesList";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  loader: async () => {
    // Load jokes data when the route is accessed
    return getJokes();
  },
  component: App,
});

const App = () => {
  const jokes = Route.useLoaderData() || [];

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col p-4">
      <h1 className="text-2xl">DevJokes</h1>
      <JokesList jokes={jokes} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

When the page loads, `jokes` will have data from the `jokes.json` file already!

With a little Tailwind styling, the app should look like this:

![DevJoke App with 5 DevJokes](https://res.cloudinary.com/dubc3wnbv/image/upload/v1746313558/Screenshot_2025-05-03_at_4.04.50_PM_w0eern.png)

## Step 2: Writing Data to a File

So far, we have been able to read from the file successfully! We can use the same approach to write to the `jokes.json` file using `createServerFunction`.

### Step 2.1: Create Server Function to Write to the File

It's time to modify the `jokes.json` file so that we can add new jokes to it. Let's create another server function but this time with a `POST` method to write to the same file.

```tsx
// src/serverActions/jokesActions.ts
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import * as fs from "node:fs";
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from "uuid"; // Add this import
import type { Joke, JokesData } from "../types";

export const addJoke = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
  .validator((data: { question: string; answer: string }) => {
    // Validate input data
    if (!data.question || !data.question.trim()) {
      throw new Error("Joke question is required");
    }
    if (!data.answer || !data.answer.trim()) {
      throw new Error("Joke answer is required");
    }
    return data;
  })
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    try {
      // Read the existing jokes from the file
      const jokesData = await getJokes();

      // Create a new joke with a unique ID
      const newJoke: Joke = {
        id: uuidv4(),
        question: data.question,
        answer: data.answer,
      };

      // Add the new joke to the list
      const updatedJokes = [...jokesData, newJoke];

      // Write the updated jokes back to the file
      await fs.promises.writeFile(
        JOKES_FILE,
        JSON.stringify(updatedJokes, null, 2),
        "utf-8",
      );

      return newJoke;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Failed to add joke:", error);
      throw new Error("Failed to add joke");
    }
  });
```

In this code:

- We are using `createServerFn` to create server functions that run on the server but can be called from the client. This server function is used to write data to the file.
- We are going to first use `validator` to validate the input data. This is a good practice to ensure that the data we are receiving is in the correct format.
- We are going to perform the actual write operation in the `handler` function.
- `getJokes` reads the jokes from our JSON file.
- `addJoke` validates the input data and adds a new joke to our file.
- We're using `uuidv4()` to generate unique IDs for our jokes.

### Step 2.2: Adding a Form to Add Jokes to our JSON File

Now, let's modify our home page to display jokes and provide a form to add new ones. Let's create a new component called `JokeForm.jsx` and add the following form to it:

```tsx
// src/components/JokeForm.tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { useRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { addJoke } from "../serverActions/jokesActions";

export function JokeForm() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const [question, setQuestion] = useState("");
  const [answer, setAnswer] = useState("");
  const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="mb-6 flex flex-row gap-2">
      {error && <div className="mb-4 rounded bg-red-100 p-2 text-red-700">{error}</div>}

      <div className="mb-8 flex flex-col gap-4 sm:flex-row">
        <input
          id="question"
          type="text"
          placeholder="Enter joke question"
          className="w-full flex-1 rounded border p-2 focus:ring focus:ring-blue-300"
          value={question}
          onChange={(e) => setQuestion(e.target.value)}
          required
        />

        <input
          id="answer"
          type="text"
          placeholder="Enter joke answer"
          className="w-full flex-1 rounded border p-2 py-4 focus:ring focus:ring-blue-300"
          value={answer}
          onChange={(e) => setAnswer(e.target.value)}
          required
        />

        <button
          type="submit"
          disabled={isSubmitting}
          className="rounded bg-blue-500 px-4 font-medium text-white hover:bg-blue-600 disabled:opacity-50"
        >
          {isSubmitting ? "Adding..." : "Add Joke"}
        </button>
      </div>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Step 2.3: Wire Up the Form to the Server Function

Now, let's wire the form up to our `addJoke` server function in the `handleSubmit` function. Calling a server action is simple! It's just a function call.

```tsx
//JokeForm.tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { addJoke } from "../serverActions/jokesActions";
import { useRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export function JokeForm() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const [question, setQuestion] = useState("");
  const [answer, setAnswer] = useState("");
  const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const handleSubmit = async () => {
    if (!question || !answer || isSubmitting) return;
    try {
      setIsSubmitting(true);
      await addJoke({
        data: { question, answer },
      });

      // Clear form
      setQuestion("");
      setAnswer("");

      // Refresh data
      router.invalidate();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Failed to add joke:", error);
      setError("Failed to add joke");
    } finally {
      setIsSubmitting(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="mb-6 flex flex-row gap-2">
      {error && <div className="mb-4 rounded bg-red-100 p-2 text-red-700">{error}</div>}
      <input
        type="text"
        name="question"
        placeholder="Question"
        className="w-full rounded border p-1"
        required
        onChange={(e) => setQuestion(e.target.value)}
        value={question}
      />
      <input
        type="text"
        name="answer"
        placeholder="Answer"
        className="w-full rounded border p-1"
        required
        onChange={(e) => setAnswer(e.target.value)}
        value={answer}
      />
      <button
        className="rounded bg-blue-500 p-1 text-white hover:bg-blue-600"
        disabled={isSubmitting}
      >
        {isSubmitting ? "Adding..." : "Add Joke"}
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

With this, our UI should look like this:

## Understanding How It All Works Together

Let's break down how the different parts of our application work together:

1. **Server Functions**: These run on the server and handle data operations
   - `getJokes`: Reads the jokes from our JSON file
   - `addJoke`: Adds a new joke to our JSON file

2. **TanStack Router**: Handles routing and data loading
   - The loader function fetches jokes data when the route is accessed
   - `useLoaderData` makes this data available in our component
   - `router.invalidate()` refreshes the data when we add a new joke

3. **React Components**: Build the UI of our application
   - `JokesList`: Displays the list of jokes
   - `JokeForm`: Provides a form for adding new jokes

4. **File-Based Storage**: Stores our jokes in a JSON file
   - Reading and writing are handled by Node.js `fs` module
   - Data is persisted between server restarts

## How Data Flows Through the Application

### Data Flow

![Data Flow Diagram](https://res.cloudinary.com/dubc3wnbv/image/upload/v1746437057/Screenshot_2025-05-05_at_2.23.11_AM_wxfz2m.png)

When a user visits the home page:

1. The `loader` function in the route calls `getJokes()` server function
2. The server reads `jokes.json` and returns the jokes data
3. This data is passed to the `HomePage` component through `useLoaderData()`
4. The `HomePage` component passes the data to the `JokesList` component

When a user adds a new joke:

1. They fill out the form and submit it
2. The `handleSubmit` function calls the `addJoke()` server function
3. The server reads the current jokes, adds the new joke, and writes the updated data back to `jokes.json`
4. After the operation completes, we call `router.invalidate()` to refresh the data
5. This triggers the loader again, fetching the updated jokes
6. The UI updates to show the new joke in the list

Here's a demo of the app in action:

## Common Issues and Debugging

Here are some common issues you might encounter when building your TanStack Start application and how to resolve them:

### Server Functions Not Working

If your server functions aren't working as expected:

1. Check that you're using the correct HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)
2. Ensure file paths are correct and accessible to the server
3. Check the server console for error messages
4. Make sure you're not using client-only APIs in server functions

### Route Data Not Loading

If route data isn't loading properly:

1. Verify that your loader function is properly implemented
2. Check that you're using `useLoaderData()` correctly
3. Look for errors in the browser console
4. Make sure your server function is working correctly

### Form Submission Issues

If form submissions aren't working:

1. Check for validation errors in your server function
2. Verify that form event prevention (`e.preventDefault()`) is working
3. Make sure state updates are happening correctly
4. Look for network errors in the browser's Developer Tools

### File Reading/Writing Issues

When working with file-based storage:

1. Ensure file paths are correct
2. Check file permissions
3. Make sure you're handling async operations properly with `await`
4. Add proper error handling for file operations

id: selective-ssr
title: Selective Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
---

## What is Selective SSR?

In TanStack Start, routes matching the initial request are rendered on the server by default. This means `beforeLoad` and `loader` are executed on the server, followed by rendering the route components. The resulting HTML is sent to the client, which hydrates the markup into a fully interactive application.

However, there are cases where you might want to disable SSR for certain routes or all routes, such as:

- When `beforeLoad` or `loader` requires browser-only APIs (e.g., `localStorage`).
- When the route component depends on browser-only APIs (e.g., `canvas`).

TanStack Start's Selective SSR feature lets you configure:

- Which routes should execute `beforeLoad` or `loader` on the server.
- Which route components should be rendered on the server.

## How does this compare to SPA mode?

TanStack Start's [SPA mode](../spa-mode) completely disables server-side execution of `beforeLoad` and `loader`, as well as server-side rendering of route components. Selective SSR allows you to configure server-side handling on a per-route basis, either statically or dynamically.

## Configuration

You can control how a route is handled during the initial server request using the `ssr` property. If this property is not set, it defaults to `true`. You can change this default using the `defaultSsr` option in `createRouter`:

```tsx
// src/router.tsx
import { createRouter as createTanStackRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

export function createRouter() {
  const router = createTanStackRouter({
    routeTree,
    scrollRestoration: true,
    defaultPendingComponent: () => <div>Loading...</div>,
    // Disable SSR by default
    defaultSsr: false,
  });

  return router;
}
```

### `ssr: true`

This is the default behavior unless otherwise configured. On the initial request, it will:

- Run `beforeLoad` on the server and send the resulting context to the client.
- Run `loader` on the server and send the loader data to the client.
- Render the component on the server and send the HTML markup to the client.

```tsx
// src/routes/posts/$postId.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  ssr: true,
  beforeLoad: () => {
    console.log("Executes on the server during the initial request");
    console.log("Executes on the client for subsequent navigation");
  },
  loader: () => {
    console.log("Executes on the server during the initial request");
    console.log("Executes on the client for subsequent navigation");
  },
  component: () => <div>This component is rendered on the server</div>,
});
```

### `ssr: false`

This disables server-side:

- Execution of the route's `beforeLoad` and `loader`.
- Rendering of the route component.

```tsx
// src/routes/posts/$postId.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  ssr: false,
  beforeLoad: () => {
    console.log("Executes on the client during hydration");
  },
  loader: () => {
    console.log("Executes on the client during hydration");
  },
  component: () => <div>This component is rendered on the client</div>,
});
```

### `ssr: 'data-only'`

This hybrid option will:

- Run `beforeLoad` on the server and send the resulting context to the client.
- Run `loader` on the server and send the loader data to the client.
- Disable server-side rendering of the route component.

```tsx
// src/routes/posts/$postId.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  ssr: "data-only",
  beforeLoad: () => {
    console.log("Executes on the server during the initial request");
    console.log("Executes on the client for subsequent navigation");
  },
  loader: () => {
    console.log("Executes on the server during the initial request");
    console.log("Executes on the client for subsequent navigation");
  },
  component: () => <div>This component is rendered on the client</div>,
});
```

### Functional Form

For more flexibility, you can use the functional form of the `ssr` property to decide at runtime whether to SSR a route:

```tsx
// src/routes/docs/$docType/$docId.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/docs/$docType/$docId")({
  validateSearch: z.object({ details: z.boolean().optional() }),
  ssr: ({ params, search }) => {
    if (params.status === "success" && params.value.docType === "sheet") {
      return false;
    }
    if (search.status === "success" && search.value.details) {
      return "data-only";
    }
  },
  beforeLoad: () => {
    console.log("Executes on the server depending on the result of ssr()");
  },
  loader: () => {
    console.log("Executes on the server depending on the result of ssr()");
  },
  component: () => <div>This component is rendered on the client</div>,
});
```

The `ssr` function runs only on the server during the initial request and is stripped from the client bundle.

`search` and `params` are passed in after validation as a discriminated union:

```tsx
params:
    | { status: 'success'; value: Expand<ResolveAllParamsFromParent<TParentRoute, TParams>> }
    | { status: 'error'; error: unknown }
search:
    | { status: 'success'; value: Expand<ResolveFullSearchSchema<TParentRoute, TSearchValidator>> }
    | { status: 'error'; error: unknown }
```

If validation fails, `status` will be `error` and `error` will contain the failure details. Otherwise, `status` will be `success` and `value` will contain the validated data.

### Inheritance

At runtime, a child route inherits the Selective SSR configuration of its parent. However, the inherited value can only be changed to be more restrictive (i.e. `true` to `data-only` or `false` and `data-only` to `false`). For example:

```tsx
root { ssr: undefined }
  posts { ssr: false }
     $postId { ssr: true }
```

- `root` defaults to `ssr: true`.
- `posts` explicitly sets `ssr: false`, so neither `beforeLoad` nor `loader` will run on the server, and the route component won't be rendered on the server.
- `$postId` sets `ssr: true`, but inherits `ssr: false` from its parent. Because the inherited value can only be changed to be more restrictive, `ssr: true` has no effect and the inherited `ssr: false` will remain.

Another example:

```tsx
root { ssr: undefined }
  posts { ssr: 'data-only' }
     $postId { ssr: true }
       details { ssr: false }
```

- `root` defaults to `ssr: true`.
- `posts` sets `ssr: 'data-only'`, so `beforeLoad` and `loader` run on the server, but the route component isn't rendered on the server.
- `$postId` sets `ssr: true`, but inherits `ssr: 'data-only'` from its parent.
- `details` sets `ssr: false`, so neither `beforeLoad` nor `loader` will run on the server, and the route component won't be rendered on the server. Here the inherited value is changed to be more restrictive, and therefore, the `ssr: false` will override the inherited value.

## Fallback Rendering

For the first route with `ssr: false` or `ssr: 'data-only'`, the server will render the route's `pendingComponent` as a fallback. If `pendingComponent` isn't configured, the `defaultPendingComponent` will be rendered. If neither is configured, no fallback will be rendered.

On the client during hydration, this fallback will be displayed for at least `minPendingMs` (or `defaultPendingMinMs` if not configured), even if the route doesn't have `beforeLoad` or `loader` defined.

title: Server Functions

## What are Server Functions?

Server functions allow you to specify logic that can be invoked almost anywhere (even the client), but run **only** on the server. In fact, they are not so different from an API Route, but with a few key differences:

- They do not have stable public URL.
- They can be called from anywhere in your application, including loaders, hooks, components, server routes etc.

However, they are similar to regular API Routes in that:

- They have access to the request context, allowing you to read headers, set cookies, and more
- They can access sensitive information, such as environment variables, without exposing them to the client
- They can be used to perform any kind of server-side logic, such as fetching data from a database, sending emails, or interacting with other services
- They can return any value, including primitives, JSON-serializable objects, and even raw Response objects
- They can throw errors, including redirects and notFounds, which can be handled automatically by the router

> How are server functions different from "React Server Functions"?
>
> - TanStack Server Functions are not tied to a specific front-end framework, and can be used with any front-end framework or none at all.
> - TanStack Server Functions are backed by standard HTTP requests and can be called as often as you like without suffering from serial-execution bottlenecks.

## How do they work?

Server functions can be defined anywhere in your application, but must be defined at the top level of a file. They can be called throughout your application, including loaders, hooks, etc. Traditionally, this pattern is known as a Remote Procedure Call (RPC), but due to the isomorphic nature of these functions, we refer to them as server functions.

- On the server bundle, server functions logic is left alone. Nothing needs to be done since they are already in the correct place.
- On the client, server functions will be removed; they exist only on the server. Any calls to the server function on the client will be replaced with a `fetch` request to the server to execute the server function, and send the response back to the client.

## Server Function Middleware

Server functions can use middleware to share logic, context, common operations, prerequisites, and much more. To learn more about server function middleware, be sure to read about them in the [Middleware guide](../middleware.md).

## Defining Server Functions

> We'd like to thank the [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) team for both the inspiration of TanStack Start's server function design and guidance while implementing it. We love (and recommend) using tRPC for API Routes so much that we insisted on server functions getting the same 1st class treatment and developer experience. Thank you!

Server functions are defined with the `createServerFn` function, from the `@tanstack/react-start` package. This function takes an optional `options` argument for specifying configuration like the HTTP method and response type, and allows you to chain off the result to define things like the body of the server function, input validation, middleware, etc. Here's a simple example:

```tsx
// getServerTime.ts
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

export const getServerTime = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
  // Wait for 1 second
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  // Return the current time
  return new Date().toISOString();
});
```

### Configuration Options

When creating a server function, you can provide configuration options to customize its behavior:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

export const getData = createServerFn({
  method: "GET", // HTTP method to use
  response: "data", // Response handling mode
}).handler(async () => {
  // Function implementation
});
```

#### Available Options

**`method`**

Specifies the HTTP method for the server function request:

```tsx
method?: 'GET' | 'POST'
```

By default, server functions use `GET` if not specified.

**`response`**

Controls how responses are processed and returned:

```tsx
response?: 'data' | 'full' | 'raw'
```

- `'data'` (default): Automatically parses JSON responses and returns just the data
- `'full'`: Returns a response object with result data, error information, and context
- `'raw'`: Returns the raw Response object directly, enabling streaming responses and custom headers

## Where can I call server functions?

- From server-side code
- From client-side code
- From other server functions

> [!WARNING]
> Server functions cannot be called from API Routes. If you need to share business logic between server functions and API Routes, extract the shared logic into utility functions that can be imported by both.

## Accepting Parameters

Server functions accept a single parameter, which can be a variety of types:

- Standard JavaScript types
  - `string`
  - `number`
  - `boolean`
  - `null`
  - `Array`
  - `Object`
- FormData
- ReadableStream (of any of the above)
- Promise (of any of the above)

Here's an example of a server function that accepts a simple string parameter:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

export const greet = createServerFn({
  method: "GET",
})
  .validator((data: string) => data)
  .handler(async (ctx) => {
    return `Hello, ${ctx.data}!`;
  });

greet({
  data: "John",
});
```

## Runtime Input Validation / Type Safety

Server functions can be configured to validate their input data at runtime, while adding type safety. This is useful for ensuring the input is of the correct type before executing the server function, and providing more friendly error messages.

This is done with the `validator` method. It will accept whatever input is passed to the server function. The value (and type) you return from this function will become the input passed to the actual server function handler.

Validators also integrate seamlessly with external validators, if you want to use something like Zod.

### Basic Validation

Here's a simple example of a server function that validates the input parameter:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

type Person = {
  name: string;
};

export const greet = createServerFn({ method: "GET" })
  .validator((person: unknown): Person => {
    if (typeof person !== "object" || person === null) {
      throw new Error("Person must be an object");
    }

    if ("name" in person && typeof person.name !== "string") {
      throw new Error("Person.name must be a string");
    }

    return person as Person;
  })
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    return `Hello, ${data.name}!`;
  });
```

### Using a Validation Library

Validation libraries like Zod can be used like so:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

import { z } from "zod";

const Person = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
});

export const greet = createServerFn({ method: "GET" })
  .validator((person: unknown) => {
    return Person.parse(person);
  })
  .handler(async (ctx) => {
    return `Hello, ${ctx.data.name}!`;
  });

greet({
  data: {
    name: "John",
  },
});
```

## Type Safety

Since server-functions cross the network boundary, it's important to ensure the data being passed to them is not only the right type, but also validated at runtime. This is especially important when dealing with user input, as it can be unpredictable. To ensure developers validate their I/O data, types are reliant on validation. The return type of the `validator` function will be the input to the server function's handler.

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

type Person = {
  name: string;
};

export const greet = createServerFn({ method: "GET" })
  .validator((person: unknown): Person => {
    if (typeof person !== "object" || person === null) {
      throw new Error("Person must be an object");
    }

    if ("name" in person && typeof person.name !== "string") {
      throw new Error("Person.name must be a string");
    }

    return person as Person;
  })
  .handler(
    async ({
      data, // Person
    }) => {
      return `Hello, ${data.name}!`;
    },
  );

function test() {
  greet({ data: { name: "John" } }); // OK
  greet({ data: { name: 123 } }); // Error: Argument of type '{ name: number; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Person'.
}
```

## Inference

Server functions infer their input, and output types based on the input to the `validator`, and return value of `handler` functions, respectively. In fact, the `validator` you define can even have its own separate input/output types, which can be useful if your validator performs transformations on the input data.

To illustrate this, let's take a look at an example using the `zod` validation library:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { z } from "zod";

const transactionSchema = z.object({
  amount: z.string().transform((val) => parseInt(val, 10)),
});

const createTransaction = createServerFn()
  .validator(transactionSchema)
  .handler(({ data }) => {
    return data.amount; // Returns a number
  });

createTransaction({
  data: {
    amount: "123", // Accepts a string
  },
});
```

## Non-Validated Inference

While we highly recommend using a validation library to validate your network I/O data, you may, for whatever reason _not_ want to validate your data, but still have type safety. To do this, provide type information to the server function using an identity function as the `validator`, that types the input, and or output to the correct types:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

type Person = {
  name: string;
};

export const greet = createServerFn({ method: "GET" })
  .validator((d: Person) => d)
  .handler(async (ctx) => {
    return `Hello, ${ctx.data.name}!`;
  });

greet({
  data: {
    name: "John",
  },
});
```

## JSON Parameters

Server functions can accept JSON-serializable objects as parameters. This is useful for passing complex data structures to the server:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

export const greet = createServerFn({ method: "GET" })
  .validator((data: Person) => data)
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    return `Hello, ${data.name}! You are ${data.age} years old.`;
  });

greet({
  data: {
    name: "John",
    age: 34,
  },
});
```

## FormData Parameters

Server functions can accept `FormData` objects as parameters

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

export const greetUser = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
  .validator((data) => {
    if (!(data instanceof FormData)) {
      throw new Error("Invalid form data");
    }
    const name = data.get("name");
    const age = data.get("age");

    if (!name || !age) {
      throw new Error("Name and age are required");
    }

    return {
      name: name.toString(),
      age: parseInt(age.toString(), 10),
    };
  })
  .handler(async ({ data: { name, age } }) => {
    return `Hello, ${name}! You are ${age} years old.`;
  });

// Usage
function Test() {
  return (
    <form
      onSubmit={async (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget);
        const response = await greetUser({ data: formData });
        console.log(response);
      }}
    >
      <input name="name" />
      <input name="age" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

## Server Function Context

In addition to the single parameter that server functions accept, you can also access server request context from within any server function using utilities from `@tanstack/react-start/server`. Under the hood, we use [Unjs](https://unjs.io/)'s `h3` package to perform cross-platform HTTP requests.

There are many context functions available to you for things like:

- Accessing the request context
- Accessing/setting headers
- Accessing/setting sessions/cookies
- Setting response status codes and status messages
- Dealing with multi-part form data
- Reading/Setting custom server context properties

For a full list of available context functions, see all of the available [h3 Methods](https://h3.unjs.io/utils/request) or inspect the [@tanstack/start-server-core Source Code](https://github.com/TanStack/router/tree/main/packages/start-server-core/src).

For starters, here are a few examples:

## Accessing the Request Context

Let's use the `getWebRequest` function to access the request itself from within a server function:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { getWebRequest } from "@tanstack/react-start/server";

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(async () => {
  const request = getWebRequest();

  console.log(request.method); // GET

  console.log(request.headers.get("User-Agent")); // Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3
});
```

## Accessing Headers

Use the `getHeaders` function to access all headers from within a server function:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { getHeaders } from "@tanstack/react-start/server";

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(async () => {
  console.log(getHeaders());
  // {
  //   "accept": "*/*",
  //   "accept-encoding": "gzip, deflate, br",
  //   "accept-language": "en-US,en;q=0.9",
  //   "connection": "keep-alive",
  //   "host": "localhost:3000",
  //   ...
  // }
});
```

You can also access individual headers using the `getHeader` function:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { getHeader } from "@tanstack/react-start/server";

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(async () => {
  console.log(getHeader("User-Agent")); // Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3
});
```

## Returning Values

Server functions can return a few different types of values:

- Primitives
- JSON-serializable objects
- `redirect` errors (can also be thrown)
- `notFound` errors (can also be thrown)
- Raw Response objects

## Returning Primitives and JSON

To return any primitive or JSON-serializable object, simply return the value from the server function:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(async () => {
  return new Date().toISOString();
});

export const getServerData = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(async () => {
  return {
    message: "Hello, World!",
  };
});
```

By default, server functions assume that any non-Response object returned is either a primitive or JSON-serializable object.

## Responding with Custom Headers

To respond with custom headers, you can use the `setHeader` function:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { setHeader } from "@tanstack/react-start/server";

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(async () => {
  setHeader("X-Custom-Header", "value");
  return new Date().toISOString();
});
```

## Responding with Custom Status Codes

To respond with a custom status code, you can use the `setResponseStatus` function:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { setResponseStatus } from "@tanstack/react-start/server";

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(async () => {
  setResponseStatus(201);
  return new Date().toISOString();
});
```

## Returning Raw Response objects

To return a raw Response object, return a Response object from the server function and set `response: 'raw'`:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({
  method: "GET",
  response: "raw",
}).handler(async () => {
  // Read a file from s3
  return fetch("https://example.com/time.txt");
});
```

The response: 'raw' option also allows for streaming responses among other things:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

export const streamEvents = createServerFn({
  method: "GET",
  response: "raw",
}).handler(async ({ signal }) => {
  // Create a ReadableStream to send chunks of data
  const stream = new ReadableStream({
    async start(controller) {
      // Send initial response immediately
      controller.enqueue(new TextEncoder().encode("Connection established\n"));

      let count = 0;
      const interval = setInterval(() => {
        // Check if the client disconnected
        if (signal.aborted) {
          clearInterval(interval);
          controller.close();
          return;
        }

        // Send a data chunk
        controller.enqueue(
          new TextEncoder().encode(`Event ${++count}: ${new Date().toISOString()}\n`),
        );

        // End after 10 events
        if (count >= 10) {
          clearInterval(interval);
          controller.close();
        }
      }, 1000);

      // Ensure we clean up if the request is aborted
      signal.addEventListener("abort", () => {
        clearInterval(interval);
        controller.close();
      });
    },
  });

  // Return a streaming response
  return new Response(stream, {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "text/event-stream",
      "Cache-Control": "no-cache",
      Connection: "keep-alive",
    },
  });
});
```

The `response: 'raw'` option is particularly useful for:

- Streaming APIs where data is sent incrementally
- Server-sent events
- Long-polling responses
- Custom content types and binary data

## Throwing Errors

Aside from special `redirect` and `notFound` errors, server functions can throw any custom error. These errors will be serialized and sent to the client as a JSON response along with a 500 status code.

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

export const doStuff = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(async () => {
  throw new Error("Something went wrong!");
});

// Usage
function Test() {
  try {
    await doStuff();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    // {
    //   message: "Something went wrong!",
    //   stack: "Error: Something went wrong!\n    at doStuff (file:///path/to/file.ts:3:3)"
    // }
  }
}
```

## Cancellation

On the client, server function calls can be cancelled via an `AbortSignal`.
On the server, an `AbortSignal` will notify if the request closed before execution finished.

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

export const abortableServerFn = createServerFn().handler(async ({ signal }) => {
  return new Promise<string>((resolve, reject) => {
    if (signal.aborted) {
      return reject(new Error("Aborted before start"));
    }
    const timerId = setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("server function finished");
      resolve("server function result");
    }, 1000);
    const onAbort = () => {
      clearTimeout(timerId);
      console.log("server function aborted");
      reject(new Error("Aborted"));
    };
    signal.addEventListener("abort", onAbort, { once: true });
  });
});

// Usage
function Test() {
  const controller = new AbortController();
  const serverFnPromise = abortableServerFn({
    signal: controller.signal,
  });
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
  controller.abort();
  try {
    const serverFnResult = await serverFnPromise;
    console.log(serverFnResult); // should never get here
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error); // "signal is aborted without reason"
  }
}
```

## Calling server functions from within route lifecycles

Server functions can be called normally from route `loader`s, `beforeLoad`s, or any other router-controlled APIs. These APIs are equipped to handle errors, redirects, and notFounds thrown by server functions automatically.

```tsx
import { getServerTime } from "./getServerTime";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/time")({
  loader: async () => {
    const time = await getServerTime();

    return {
      time,
    };
  },
});
```

## Calling server functions from hooks and components

Server functions can throw `redirect`s or `notFound`s and while not required, it is recommended to catch these errors and handle them appropriately. To make this easier, the `@tanstack/react-start` package exports a `useServerFn` hook that can be used to bind server functions to components and hooks:

```tsx
import { useServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { getServerTime } from "./getServerTime";

export function Time() {
  const getTime = useServerFn(getServerTime);

  const timeQuery = useQuery({
    queryKey: "time",
    queryFn: () => getTime(),
  });
}
```

## Calling server functions anywhere else

When using server functions, be aware that redirects and notFounds they throw will only be handled automatically when called from:

- Route lifecycles
- Components using the useServerFn hook

For other usage locations, you'll need to handle these cases manually.

## Redirects

Server functions can throw a `redirect` error to redirect the user to a different URL. This is useful for handling authentication, authorization, or other scenarios where you need to redirect the user to a different page.

- During SSR, redirects are handled by sending a 302 response to the client with the new location
- On the client, redirects are handled by the router automatically from within a route lifecycle or a component that uses the `useServerFn` hook. If you call a server function from anywhere else, redirects will not be handled automatically.

To throw a redirect, you can use the `redirect` function exported from the `@tanstack/react-router` package:

```tsx
import { redirect } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

export const doStuff = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(async () => {
  // Redirect the user to the home page
  throw redirect({
    to: "/",
  });
});
```

Redirects can utilize all of the same options as `router.navigate`, `useNavigate()` and `<Link>` components. So feel free to also pass:

- Path Params
- Search Params
- Hash

Redirects can also set the status code of the response by passing a `status` option:

```tsx
import { redirect } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

export const doStuff = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(async () => {
  // Redirect the user to the home page with a 301 status code
  throw redirect({
    to: "/",
    status: 301,
  });
});
```

You can also redirect to an external target using `href`:

```tsx
import { redirect } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

export const auth = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(async () => {
  // Redirect the user to the auth provider
  throw redirect({
    href: "https://authprovider.com/login",
  });
});
```

> ⚠️ Do not use `@tanstack/react-start/server`'s `sendRedirect` function to send soft redirects from within server functions. This will send the redirect using the `Location` header and will force a full page hard navigation on the client.

## Redirect Headers

You can also set custom headers on a redirect by passing a `headers` option:

```tsx
import { redirect } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

export const doStuff = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(async () => {
  // Redirect the user to the home page with a custom header
  throw redirect({
    to: "/",
    headers: {
      "X-Custom-Header": "value",
    },
  });
});
```

## Not Found

While calling a server function from a `loader` or `beforeLoad` route lifecycle, a special `notFound` error can be thrown to indicate to the router that the requested resource was not found. This is more useful than a simple 404 status code, as it allows you to render a custom 404 page, or handle the error in a custom way. If notFound is thrown from a server function used outside of a route lifecycle, it will not be handled automatically.

To throw a notFound, you can use the `notFound` function exported from the `@tanstack/react-router` package:

```tsx
import { notFound } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

const getStuff = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(async () => {
  // Randomly return a not found error
  if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
    throw notFound();
  }

  // Or return some stuff
  return {
    stuff: "stuff",
  };
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/stuff")({
  loader: async () => {
    const stuff = await getStuff();

    return {
      stuff,
    };
  },
});
```

Not found errors are a core feature of TanStack Router,

## Handling Errors

If a server function throws a (non-redirect/non-notFound) error, it will be serialized and sent to the client as a JSON response along with a 500 status code. This is useful for debugging, but you may want to handle these errors in a more user-friendly way. You can do this by catching the error and handling it in your route lifecycle, component, or hook as you normally would.

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

export const doStuff = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(async () => {
  undefined.foo();
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/stuff")({
  loader: async () => {
    try {
      await doStuff();
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle the error:
      // error === {
      //   message: "Cannot read property 'foo' of undefined",
      //   stack: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'foo' of undefined\n    at doStuff (file:///path/to/file.ts:3:3)"
    }
  },
});
```

## No-JS Server Functions

Without JavaScript enabled, there's only one way to execute server functions: by submitting a form.

This is done by adding a `form` element to the page
with [the HTML attribute `action`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/action).

> Notice that we mentioned the **HTML** attribute `action`. This attribute only accepts a string in HTML, just like all
> other attributes.
>
> While React 19
> [added support for passing a function to `action`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/form#form),
> it's
> a React-specific feature and not part of the HTML standard.

The `action` attribute tells the browser where to send the form data when the form is submitted. In this case, we want
to send the form data to the server function.

To do this, we can utilize the `url` property of the server function:

```ts
const yourFn = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
  .validator((formData) => {
    if (!(formData instanceof FormData)) {
      throw new Error("Invalid form data");
    }

    const name = formData.get("name");

    if (!name) {
      throw new Error("Name is required");
    }

    return name;
  })
  .handler(async ({ data: name }) => {
    console.log(name); // 'John'
  });

console.info(yourFn.url);
```

And pass this to the `action` attribute of the form:

```tsx
function Component() {
  return (
    <form action={yourFn.url} method="POST">
      <input name="name" defaultValue="John" />
      <button type="submit">Click me!</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

When the form is submitted, the server function will be executed.

### No-JS Server Function Arguments

To pass arguments to a server function when submitting a form, you can use the `input` element with the `name` attribute
to attach the argument to the [`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) passed to your
server function:

```tsx
const yourFn = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
  .validator((formData) => {
    if (!(formData instanceof FormData)) {
      throw new Error("Invalid form data");
    }

    const age = formData.get("age");

    if (!age) {
      throw new Error("age is required");
    }

    return age.toString();
  })
  .handler(async ({ data: formData }) => {
    // `age` will be '123'
    const age = formData.get("age");
    // ...
  });

function Component() {
  return (
    //  We need to tell the server that our data type is `multipart/form-data` by setting the `encType` attribute on the form.
    <form action={yourFn.url} method="POST" encType="multipart/form-data">
      <input name="age" defaultValue="34" />
      <button type="submit">Click me!</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

When the form is submitted, the server function will be executed with the form's data as an argument.

### No-JS Server Function Return Value

Regardless of whether JavaScript is enabled, the server function will return a response to the HTTP request made from
the client.

When JavaScript is enabled, this response can be accessed as the return value of the server function in the client's
JavaScript code.

```ts
const yourFn = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
  return "Hello, world!";
});

// `.then` is not available when JavaScript is disabled
yourFn().then(console.log);
```

However, when JavaScript is disabled, there is no way to access the return value of the server function in the client's
JavaScript code.

Instead, the server function can provide a response to the client, telling the browser to navigate in a certain way.

When combined with a `loader` from TanStack Router, we're able to provide an experience similar to a single-page application, even when
JavaScript is disabled;
all by telling the browser to reload the current page with new data piped through the `loader`:

```tsx
import * as fs from "fs";
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

const filePath = "count.txt";

async function readCount() {
  return parseInt(await fs.promises.readFile(filePath, "utf-8").catch(() => "0"));
}

const getCount = createServerFn({
  method: "GET",
}).handler(() => {
  return readCount();
});

const updateCount = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
  .validator((formData) => {
    if (!(formData instanceof FormData)) {
      throw new Error("Invalid form data");
    }

    const addBy = formData.get("addBy");

    if (!addBy) {
      throw new Error("addBy is required");
    }

    return parseInt(addBy.toString());
  })
  .handler(async ({ data: addByAmount }) => {
    const count = await readCount();
    await fs.promises.writeFile(filePath, `${count + addByAmount}`);
    // Reload the page to trigger the loader again
    return new Response("ok", { status: 301, headers: { Location: "/" } });
  });

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  component: Home,
  loader: async () => await getCount(),
});

function Home() {
  const state = Route.useLoaderData();

  return (
    <div>
      <form action={updateCount.url} method="POST" encType="multipart/form-data">
        <input type="number" name="addBy" defaultValue="1" />
        <button type="submit">Add</button>
      </form>
      <pre>{state}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Static Server Functions

When using prerendering/static-generation, server functions can also be "static", which enables their results to be cached at build time and served as static assets.

Learn all about this pattern on the [Static Server Functions](../static-server-functions) page.

## How are server functions compiled?

Under the hood, server functions are extracted out of the client bundle and into a separate server bundle. On the server, they are executed as-is, and the result is sent back to the client. On the client, server functions proxy the request to the server, which executes the function and sends the result back to the client, all via `fetch`.

The process looks like this:

- When `createServerFn` is found in a file, the inner function is checked for a `use server` directive
- If the `use server` directive is missing, it is added to the top of the function
- On the client, the inner function is extracted out of the client bundle and into a separate server bundle
- The client-side server function is replaced with a proxy function that sends a request to the server to execute the function that was extracted
- On the server, the server function is not extracted, and is executed as-is
- After extraction occurs, each bundle applies a dead-code elimination process to remove any unused code from each bundle.

title: Server Routes
---

Server routes are a powerful feature of TanStack Start that allow you to create server-side endpoints in your application and are useful for handling raw HTTP requests, form submissions, user authentication, and much more.

Server routes can be defined in your `./src/routes` directory of your project **right alongside your TanStack Router routes** and are automatically handled by the TanStack Start server.

Here's what a simple server route looks like:

```ts
// routes/hello.ts

export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
  GET: async ({ request }) => {
    return new Response("Hello, World!");
  },
});
```

## Server Routes and App Routes

Because server routes can be defined in the same directory as your app routes, you can even use the same file for both!

```tsx
// routes/hello.tsx

export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
  POST: async ({ request }) => {
    const body = await request.json();
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ message: `Hello, ${body.name}!` }));
  },
});

export const Route = createFileRoute("/hello")({
  component: HelloComponent,
});

function HelloComponent() {
  const [reply, setReply] = useState("");

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          fetch("/hello", {
            method: "POST",
            headers: {
              "Content-Type": "application/json",
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({ name: "Tanner" }),
          })
            .then((res) => res.json())
            .then((data) => setReply(data.message));
        }}
      >
        Say Hello
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## File Route Conventions

Server routes in TanStack Start, follow the same file-based routing conventions as TanStack Router. This means that each file in your `routes` directory with a `ServerRoute` export will be treated as an API route. Here are a few examples:

- `/routes/users.ts` will create an API route at `/users`
- `/routes/users.index.ts` will **also** create an API route at `/users` (but will error if duplicate methods are defined)
- `/routes/users/$id.ts` will create an API route at `/users/$id`
- `/routes/users/$id/posts.ts` will create an API route at `/users/$id/posts`
- `/routes/users.$id.posts.ts` will create an API route at `/users/$id/posts`
- `/routes/api/file/$.ts` will create an API route at `/api/file/$`
- `/routes/my-script[.]js.ts` will create an API route at `/my-script.js`

## Unique Route Paths

Each route can only have a single handler file associated with it. So, if you have a file named `routes/users.ts` which'd equal the request path of `/users`, you cannot have other files that'd also resolve to the same route. For example, the following files would all resolve to the same route and would error:

- `/routes/users.index.ts`
- `/routes/users.ts`
- `/routes/users/index.ts`

## Escaped Matching

Just as with normal routes, server routes can match on escaped characters. For example, a file named `routes/users[.]json.ts` will create an API route at `/users.json`.

## Pathless Layout Routes and Break-out Routes

Because of the unified routing system, pathless layout routes and break-out routes are supported for similar functionality around server route middleware.

- Pathless layout routes can be used to add middleware to a group of routes
- Break-out routes can be used to "break out" of parent middleware

## Nested Directories vs File-names

In the examples above, you may have noticed that the file naming conventions are flexible and allow you to mix and match directories and file names. This is intentional and allows you to organize your Server routes in a way that makes sense for your application. You can read more about this in the [TanStack Router File-based Routing Guide](/router/latest/docs/framework/react/routing/file-based-routing#s-or-s).

## Handling Server Route Requests

Server route requests are handled by Start's `createStartHandler` in your `server.ts` entry file.

```tsx
// server.ts
import { createStartHandler, defaultStreamHandler } from "@tanstack/react-start/server";
import { createRouter } from "./router";

export default createStartHandler({
  createRouter,
})(defaultStreamHandler);
```

The start handler is responsible for matching an incoming request to a server route and executing the appropriate middleware and handler.

Remember, if you need to customize the server handler, you can do so by creating a custom handler and then passing the event to the start handler:

```tsx
// server.ts
import { createStartHandler } from "@tanstack/react-start/server";

export default defineHandler((event) => {
  const startHandler = createStartHandler({
    createRouter,
  })(defaultStreamHandler);

  return startHandler(event);
});
```

## Defining a Server Route

Server routes are created by exporting a `ServerRoute` from a route file. The `ServerRoute` export should be created by calling the `createServerFileRoute` function. The resulting builder object can then be used to:

- Add route-level middleware
- Define handlers for each HTTP method

```ts
// routes/hello.ts
export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
  GET: async ({ request }) => {
    return new Response("Hello, World! from " + request.url);
  },
});
```

## Defining a Server Route Handler

There are two ways to define a handler for a server route.

- Provide a handler function directly to the method
- By calling the `handler` method on the method builder object for more advanced use cases

### Providing a handler function directly to the method

For simple use cases, you can provide a handler function directly to the method.

```ts
// routes/hello.ts
export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
  GET: async ({ request }) => {
    return new Response("Hello, World! from " + request.url);
  },
});
```

### Providing a handler function via the method builder object

For more complex use cases, you can provide a handler function via the method builder object. This allows you to add middleware to the method.

```tsx
// routes/hello.ts
export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods((api) => ({
  GET: api.middleware([loggerMiddleware]).handler(async ({ request }) => {
    return new Response("Hello, World! from " + request.url);
  }),
}));
```

## Handler Context

Each HTTP method handler receives an object with the following properties:

- `request`: The incoming request object. You can read more about the `Request` object in the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request).
- `params`: An object containing the dynamic path parameters of the route. For example, if the route path is `/users/$id`, and the request is made to `/users/123`, then `params` will be `{ id: '123' }`. We'll cover dynamic path parameters and wildcard parameters later in this guide.
- `context`: An object containing the context of the request. This is useful for passing data between middleware.

Once you've processed the request, you can return a `Response` object or `Promise<Response>` or even use any of the helpers from `@tanstack/react-start` to manipulate the response.

## Dynamic Path Params

Server routes support dynamic path parameters in the same way as TanStack Router. For example, a file named `routes/users/$id.ts` will create an API route at `/users/$id` that accepts a dynamic `id` parameter.

```ts
// routes/users/$id.ts
export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
  GET: async ({ params }) => {
    const { id } = params;
    return new Response(`User ID: ${id}`);
  },
});

// Visit /users/123 to see the response
// User ID: 123
```

You can also have multiple dynamic path parameters in a single route. For example, a file named `routes/users/$id/posts/$postId.ts` will create an API route at `/users/$id/posts/$postId` that accepts two dynamic parameters.

```ts
// routes/users/$id/posts/$postId.ts
export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
  GET: async ({ params }) => {
    const { id, postId } = params;
    return new Response(`User ID: ${id}, Post ID: ${postId}`);
  },
});

// Visit /users/123/posts/456 to see the response
// User ID: 123, Post ID: 456
```

## Wildcard/Splat Param

Server routes also support wildcard parameters at the end of the path, which are denoted by a `$` followed by nothing. For example, a file named `routes/file/$.ts` will create an API route at `/file/$` that accepts a wildcard parameter.

```ts
// routes/file/$.ts
export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
  GET: async ({ params }) => {
    const { _splat } = params;
    return new Response(`File: ${_splat}`);
  },
});

// Visit /file/hello.txt to see the response
// File: hello.txt
```

## Handling requests with a body

To handle POST requests,you can add a `POST` handler to the route object. The handler will receive the request object as the first argument, and you can access the request body using the `request.json()` method.

```ts
// routes/hello.ts
export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
  POST: async ({ request }) => {
    const body = await request.json();
    return new Response(`Hello, ${body.name}!`);
  },
});

// Send a POST request to /hello with a JSON body like { "name": "Tanner" }
// Hello, Tanner!
```

This also applies to other HTTP methods like `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`. You can add handlers for these methods in the route object and access the request body using the appropriate method.

It's important to remember that the `request.json()` method returns a `Promise` that resolves to the parsed JSON body of the request. You need to `await` the result to access the body.

This is a common pattern for handling POST requests in Server routes/ You can also use other methods like `request.text()` or `request.formData()` to access the body of the request.

## Responding with JSON

When returning JSON using a Response object, this is a common pattern:

```ts
// routes/hello.ts
export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
  GET: async ({ request }) => {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ message: "Hello, World!" }), {
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
    });
  },
});

// Visit /hello to see the response
// {"message":"Hello, World!"}
```

## Using the `json` helper function

Or you can use the `json` helper function to automatically set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json` and serialize the JSON object for you.

```ts
// routes/hello.ts
import { json } from "@tanstack/react-start";

export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
  GET: async ({ request }) => {
    return json({ message: "Hello, World!" });
  },
});

// Visit /hello to see the response
// {"message":"Hello, World!"}
```

## Responding with a status code

You can set the status code of the response by either:

- Passing it as a property of the second argument to the `Response` constructor

  ```ts
  // routes/hello.ts
  import { json } from "@tanstack/react-start";

  export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
    GET: async ({ request, params }) => {
      const user = await findUser(params.id);
      if (!user) {
        return new Response("User not found", {
          status: 404,
        });
      }
      return json(user);
    },
  });
  ```

- Using the `setResponseStatus` helper function from `@tanstack/react-start/server`

  ```ts
  // routes/hello.ts
  import { json } from "@tanstack/react-start";
  import { setResponseStatus } from "@tanstack/react-start/server";

  export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
    GET: async ({ request, params }) => {
      const user = await findUser(params.id);
      if (!user) {
        setResponseStatus(404);
        return new Response("User not found");
      }
      return json(user);
    },
  });
  ```

In this example, we're returning a `404` status code if the user is not found. You can set any valid HTTP status code using this method.

## Setting headers in the response

Sometimes you may need to set headers in the response. You can do this by either:

- Passing an object as the second argument to the `Response` constructor.

  ```ts
  // routes/hello.ts
  export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
    GET: async ({ request }) => {
      return new Response("Hello, World!", {
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "text/plain",
        },
      });
    },
  });

  // Visit /hello to see the response
  // Hello, World!
  ```

- Or using the `setHeaders` helper function from `@tanstack/react-start/server`.

  ```ts
  // routes/hello.ts
  import { setHeaders } from "@tanstack/react-start/server";

  export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
    GET: async ({ request }) => {
      setHeaders({
        "Content-Type": "text/plain",
      });
      return new Response("Hello, World!");
    },
  });
  ```

## What the heck is SPA mode?

For applications that do not require SSR for either SEO, crawlers, or performance reasons, it may be desirable to ship static HTML to your users containing the "shell" of your application (or even prerendered HTML for specific routes) that contain the necessary `html`, `head`, and `body` tags to bootstrap your application only on the client.

## Why use Start without SSR?

**No SSR doesn't mean giving up server-side features!** SPA modes actually pair very nicely with server-side features like server functions and/or server routes or even other external APIs. It **simply means that the initial document will not contain the fully rendered HTML of your application until it has been rendered on the client using JavaScript**.

## Benefits of SPA mode

- **Easier to deploy** - A CDN that can serve static assets is all you need.
- **Cheaper** to host - CDNs are cheap compared to Lambda functions or long-running processes.
- **Client-side Only is simpler** - No SSR means less to go wrong with hydration, rendering, and routing.

## Caveats of SPA mode

- **Slower time to full content** - Time to full content is longer since all JS must download and execute before anything below the shell can be rendered.
- **Less SEO friendly** - Robots, crawlers and link unfurlers _may_ have a harder time indexing your application unless they are configured to execute JS and your application can render within a reasonable amount of time.

## How does it work?

After enabling the SPA mode, running a Start build will have an additional prerendering step afterwards to generate the shell. This is done by:

- **Prerendering** your application's **root route only**
- Where your application would normally render your matched routes, your router's configured **pending fallback component is rendered instead**.
- The resulting HTML is stored to a static HTML page called `/_shell.html` (configurable)
- Default rewrites are configured to redirect all 404 requests to the SPA mode shell

> [!NOTE]
> Other routes may also be prerendered and it is recommended to prerender as much as you can in SPA mode, but this is not required for SPA mode to work.

## Configuring SPA mode

To configure SPA mode, there are a few options you can add to your Start plugin's options:

```tsx
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    TanStackStart({
      spa: {
        enabled: true,
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Use Necessary Redirects

Deploying a purely client-side SPA to a host or CDN often requires the use of redirects to ensure that urls are properly rewritten to the SPA shell. The goal of any deployment should include these priorities in this order:

1. Ensure that static assets will always be served if they exist, e.g. /about.html. This is usually the default behavior for most CDNs
2. (Optional) Allow-list specific subpaths to be routed through to any dynamic server handlers, e.g. /api/\*\* (More on this below)
3. Ensure that all 404 requests are rewritten to the SPA shell, e.g. a catch-all redirect to /\_shell.html (or if you have configured your shell output path to be something custom, use that instead)

## Basic Redirects Example

Let's use Netlify's `_redirects` file to rewrite all 404 requests to the SPA shell.

```
# Catch all other 404 requests and rewrite them to the SPA shell
/* /_shell.html 200
```

## Allowing Server Functions and Server Routes

Again, using Netlify's `_redirects` file, we can allow-list specific subpaths to be routed through to the server.

```
# Allow requests to /_serverFn/* to be routed through to the server (If you have configured your server function base path to be something other than /_serverFn, use that instead)
/_serverFn/* /_serverFn/:splat 200

# Allow any requests to /api/* to be routed through to the server (Server routes can be created at any path, so you must ensure that any server routes you want to use are under this path, or simply add additional redirects for each server route base you want to expose)
/api/* /api/:splat 200

# Catch all other 404 requests and rewrite them to the SPA shell
/* /_shell.html 200
```

## Shell Mask Path

The default pathname used to generate the SPA shell is `/`. We call this the **shell mask path**. Since matched routes are not included, the pathname used to generate the shell is mostly irrelevant, but it's still configurable.

> [!NOTE]
> It's recommended to keep the default value of `/` as the shell mask path.

```tsx
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tanstackStart({
      spa: {
        maskPath: "/app",
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Prerendering Options

The prerender option is used to configure the prerendering behavior of the SPA shell, and accepts the same prerender options as found in our prerendering guide.

**By default, the following `prerender` options are set:**

- `outputPath`: `/_shell.html`
- `crawlLinks`: `false`
- `retryCount`: `0`

This means that by default, the shell will not be crawled for links to follow for additional prerendering, and will not retry prerendering fails.

You can always override these options by providing your own prerender options:

```tsx
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    TanStackStart({
      spa: {
        prerender: {
          outputPath: "/custom-shell",
          crawlLinks: true,
          retryCount: 3,
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Customized rendering in SPA mode

Customizing the HTML output of the SPA shell can be useful if you want to:

- Provide generic head tags for SPA routes
- Provide a custom pending fallback component
- Change literally anything about the shell's HTML, CSS, and JS

To make this process simple, an `isShell()` function can be found on the `router` instance:

```tsx
// src/routes/root.tsx
export default function Root() {
  const isShell = useRouter().isShell();

  if (isShell) console.log("Rendering the shell!");
}
```

You can use this boolean to conditionally render different UI based on whether the current route is a shell or not, but keep in mind that after hydrating the shell, the router will immediately navigate to the first route and `isShell()` will return `false`. **This could produce flashes of unstyled content if not handled properly.**

## Dynamic Data in your Shell

Since the shell is prerendered using the SSR build of your application, any `loader`s, or server-specific functionality defined on your **Root Route** will run during the prerendering process and the data will be included in the shell.

This means that you can use dynamic data in your shell by using a `loader` or server-specific functionality.

```tsx
// src/routes/__root.tsx

export const RootRoute = createRootRoute({
  loader: async () => {
    return {
      name: "Tanner",
    };
  },
  component: Root,
});

export default function Root() {
  const { name } = useLoaderData();

  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
        <Outlet />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

title: Static Prerendering

Static prerendering is the process of generating static HTML files for your application. This can be useful for either improving the performance of your application, as it allows you to serve pre-rendered HTML files to users without having to generate them on the fly or for deploying static sites to platforms that do not support server-side rendering.

## Prerendering

TanStack Start can prerender your application to static HTML files, which can then be served to users without having to generate them on the fly. To prerender your application, you can add the `prerender` option to your tanstackStart configuration in `vite.config.ts` file:

```ts
// vite.config.ts

import { tanstackStart } from "@tanstack/react-start/plugin/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tanstackStart({
      prerender: {
        // Enable prerendering
        enabled: true,

        // Enable if you need pages to be at `/page/index.html` instead of `/page.html`
        autoSubfolderIndex: true,

        // How many prerender jobs to run at once
        concurrency: 14,

        // Whether to extract links from the HTML and prerender them also
        crawlLinks: true,

        // Filter function takes the page object and returns whether it should prerender
        filter: ({ path }) => !path.startsWith("/do-not-render-me"),

        // Number of times to retry a failed prerender job
        retryCount: 2,

        // Delay between retries in milliseconds
        retryDelay: 1000,

        // Callback when page is successfully rendered
        onSuccess: (page) => {
          console.log(`Rendered ${page.path}!`);
        },
      },
      // Optional configuration for specific pages (without this it will still automatically
      // prerender all routes)
      pages: [
        {
          path: "/my-page",
          prerender: { enabled: true, outputPath: "/my-page/index.html" },
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

title: Static Server Functions

## What are Static Server Functions?

Static server functions are server functions that are executed at build time and cached as static assets when using prerendering/static-generation. They can be set to "static" mode by passing the `type: 'static'` option to `createServerFn`:

```tsx
const myServerFn = createServerFn({ type: "static" }).handler(async () => {
  return "Hello, world!";
});
```

This pattern goes as follows:

- Build-time
  - During build-time prerendering, a server function with `type: 'static'` is executed
  - The result is cached with your build output as a static JSON file under a derived key (function ID + params/payload hash)
  - The result is returned as normal during prerendering/static-generation and used to prerender the page
- Runtime
  - Initially, the prerendered page's html is served and the server function data is embedded in the html
  - When the client mounts, the embedded server function data is hydrated
  - For future client-side invocations, the server function is replaced with a fetch call to the static JSON file

## Customizing the Server Functions Static Cache

By default, the static server function cache implementation stores and retrieves static data in the build output directory via node's `fs` module and likewise fetches the data at runtime using a `fetch` call to the same static file.

This interface can be customized by importing and calling the `createServerFnStaticCache` function to create a custom cache implementation and then calling `setServerFnStaticCache` to set it:

```tsx
import {
  createServerFnStaticCache,
  setServerFnStaticCache,
} from "@tanstack/react-start/client";

const myCustomStaticCache = createServerFnStaticCache({
  setItem: async (ctx, data) => {
    // Store the static data in your custom cache
  },
  getItem: async (ctx) => {
    // Retrieve the static data from your custom cache
  },
  fetchItem: async (ctx) => {
    // During runtime, fetch the static data from your custom cache
  },
});

setServerFnStaticCache(myCustomStaticCache);
```

id: tailwind-integration
title: Tailwind CSS Integration
---

_So you want to use Tailwind CSS in your TanStack Start project?_

This guide will help you use Tailwind CSS in your TanStack Start project.

## Tailwind CSS Version 4 (Latest)

The latest version of Tailwind CSS is 4. And it has some configuration changes that majorly differ from Tailwind CSS Version 3. It's **easier and recommended** to set up Tailwind CSS Version 4 in a TanStack Start project, as TanStack Start uses Vite as its build tool.

### Install Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind CSS and it's Vite plugin.

```shell
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
```

### Configure The Vite Plugin

Add the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin to your Vite configuration.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import tsConfigPaths from "vite-tsconfig-paths";
import { tanstackStart } from "@tanstack/react-start/plugin/vite";
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    port: 3000,
  },
  plugins: [tsConfigPaths(), tanstackStart(), tailwindcss()],
});
```

### Import Tailwind in your CSS file

You need to create a CSS file to configure Tailwind CSS instead of the configuration file in version 4. You can do this by creating a `src/styles/app.css` file or name it whatever you want.

```css
/* src/styles/app.css */
@import "tailwindcss";
```

## Import the CSS file in your `__root.tsx` file

Import the CSS file in your `__root.tsx` file with the `?url` query and make sure to add the **triple slash** directive to the top of the file.

```tsx
// src/routes/__root.tsx
/// <reference types="vite/client" />
// other imports...

import appCss from "../styles/app.css?url";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  head: () => ({
    meta: [
      // your meta tags and site config
    ],
    links: [{ rel: "stylesheet", href: appCss }],
    // other head config
  }),
  component: RootComponent,
});
```

## Use Tailwind CSS anywhere in your project

You can now use Tailwind CSS anywhere in your project.

```tsx
// src/routes/index.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  component: Home,
});

function Home() {
  return <div className="bg-red-500 p-4 text-white">Hello World</div>;
}
```

That's it! You can now use Tailwind CSS anywhere in your project 🎉.

## Tailwind CSS Version 3 (Legacy)

If you are want to use Tailwind CSS Version 3, you can use the following steps.

### Install Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind CSS and it's peer dependencies.

```shell
npm install -D tailwindcss@3 postcss autoprefixer
```

Then generate the Tailwind and PostCSS configuration files.

```shell
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

### Configure your template paths

Add the paths to all of your template files in the `tailwind.config.js` file.

```js
// tailwind.config.js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

### Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS file

Add the `@tailwind` directives for each of Tailwind's layers to your `src/styles/app.css` file.

```css
/* src/styles/app.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

id: build-from-scratch
title: Build a Project from Scratch
---

> [!NOTE]
> If you chose to quick start with an example or cloned project, you can skip this guide and move on to the [Learn the Basics](../learn-the-basics.md) guide.

_So you want to build a TanStack Start project from scratch?_

This guide will help you build a **very** basic TanStack Start web application. Together, we will use TanStack Start to:

- Serve an index page...
- Which displays a counter...
- With a button to increment the counter persistently.

[Here is what that will look like](https://stackblitz.com/github/tanstack/router/tree/main/examples/solid/start-bare)

Let's create a new project directory and initialize it.

```shell
mkdir myApp
cd myApp
npm init -y
```

> [!NOTE] > We use `npm` in all of these examples, but you can use your package manager of choice instead.

## TypeScript Configuration

We highly recommend using TypeScript with TanStack Start. Create a `tsconfig.json` file with at least the following settings:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "jsxImportSource": "solid-js",
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "target": "ES2022",
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE] > Enabling `verbatimModuleSyntax` can result in server bundles leaking into client bundles. It is recommended to keep this option disabled.

## Install Dependencies

TanStack Start is powered by [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) and requires them as dependencies.

To install them, run:

```shell
npm i @tanstack/solid-start @tanstack/solid-router vite
```

You'll also need Solid:

```shell
npm i solid-js
```

and some TypeScript:

```shell
npm i -D typescript vite-tsconfig-paths
```

## Update Configuration Files

We'll then update our `package.json` to use Vite's CLI and set `"type": "module"`:

```json
{
  // ...
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite dev",
    "build": "vite build"
  }
}
```

Then configure TanStack Start's Vite plugin in `vite.config.ts`:

> [!NOTE]
> TanStack Start will stop auto-configuring React/Solid Vite plugins. You’ll get full control - choose `vite-plugin-solid`. Set `customViteSolidPlugin: true` to opt in to this feature right now!

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import tsConfigPaths from "vite-tsconfig-paths";
import { tanstackStart } from "@tanstack/solid-start/plugin/vite";
import viteSolid from "vite-plugin-solid";

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    port: 3000,
  },
  plugins: [
    tsConfigPaths(),
    tanstackStart({ customViteSolidPlugin: true }),
    viteSolid({ ssr: true }),
  ],
});
```

## Add the Basic Templating

There are 2 required files for TanStack Start usage:

1. The router configuration
2. The root of your application

Once configuration is done, we'll have a file tree that looks like the following:

```
.
├── src/
│   ├── routes/
│   │   └── `__root.tsx`
│   ├── `router.tsx`
│   ├── `routeTree.gen.ts`
├── `.gitignore`
├── `vite.config.ts`
├── `package.json`
└── `tsconfig.json`
```

## The Router Configuration

This is the file that will dictate the behavior of TanStack Router used within Start. Here, you can configure everything
from the default [preloading functionality](/router/latest/docs/framework/solid/guide/preloading) to [caching staleness](/router/latest/docs/framework/solid/guide/data-loading).

> [!NOTE]
> You won't have a `routeTree.gen.ts` file yet. This file will be generated when you run TanStack Start for the first time.

```tsx
// src/router.tsx
import { createRouter as createTanStackRouter } from "@tanstack/solid-router";
import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

export function createRouter() {
  const router = createTanStackRouter({
    routeTree,
    scrollRestoration: true,
  });

  return router;
}

declare module "@tanstack/solid-router" {
  interface Register {
    router: ReturnType<typeof createRouter>;
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> TanStack Start provides **default server and client entry points** to handle requests and client-entry + hydration. You can customize these entry points by adding a `server.ts` and/or `client.tsx` file in the root of your project, but for now, we'll use the defaults.

## The Root of Your Application

Finally, we need to create the root of our application. This is the entry point for all other routes. The code in this file will wrap all other routes in the application.

```tsx
// src/routes/__root.tsx
import { Outlet, createRootRoute, HeadContent, Scripts } from "@tanstack/solid-router";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  head: () => ({
    meta: [
      {
        charset: "utf-8",
      },
      {
        name: "viewport",
        content: "width=device-width, initial-scale=1",
      },
      {
        title: "TanStack Start Starter",
      },
    ],
  }),
  component: RootComponent,
});

function RootComponent() {
  return <Outlet />;
}
```

## Writing Your First Route

Now that we have the basic templating setup, we can write our first route. This is done by creating a new file in the `app/routes` directory.

```tsx
// src/routes/index.tsx
import * as fs from "node:fs";
import { createFileRoute, useRouter } from "@tanstack/solid-router";
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/solid-start";

const filePath = "count.txt";

async function readCount() {
  return parseInt(await fs.promises.readFile(filePath, "utf-8").catch(() => "0"));
}

const getCount = createServerFn({
  method: "GET",
}).handler(() => {
  return readCount();
});

const updateCount = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
  .validator((d: number) => d)
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    const count = await readCount();
    await fs.promises.writeFile(filePath, `${count + data}`);
  });

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  component: Home,
  loader: async () => await getCount(),
});

function Home() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const state = Route.useLoaderData();

  return (
    <button
      type="button"
      onClick={() => {
        updateCount({ data: 1 }).then(() => {
          router.invalidate();
        });
      }}
    >
      Add 1 to {state()}?
    </button>
  );
}
```

That's it! 🤯 You've now set up a TanStack Start project and written your first route. 🎉

You can now run `npm run dev` to start your server and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your route in action.

## Deployment

> [!WARNING]
> The page is still a work in progress. We'll keep updating this page with guides on deployment to different hosting providers soon!

When a TanStack Start application is being deployed, the `target` value in the `vite.config.ts` file determines the deployment target. The deployment target can be set to one of the following values:

- [`netlify`](#netlify): Deploy to Netlify
- [`vercel`](#vercel): Deploy to Vercel
- [`cloudflare-pages`](#cloudflare-pages): Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
- [`node-server`](#nodejs): Deploy to a Node.js server
- [`bun`](#bun): Deploy to a Bun server
- ... and more to come!

Once you've chosen a deployment target, you can follow the deployment guidelines below to deploy your TanStack Start application to the hosting provider of your choice.

### Netlify

Set the `target` value to `netlify` in your `vite.config.ts` file.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { tanstackStart } from "@tanstack/solid-start/plugin/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tanstackStart({ target: "netlify" })],
});
```

Deploy your application to Netlify using their one-click deployment process, and you're ready to go!

### Vercel

Deploying your TanStack Start application to Vercel is easy and straightforward. Just set the `target` value to `vercel` in your `vite.config.ts` file, and you're ready to deploy your application to Vercel.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { tanstackStart } from "@tanstack/solid-start/plugin/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tanstackStart({ target: "vercel" })],
});
```

Deploy you application to Vercel using their one-click deployment process, and you're ready to go!

### Cloudflare Pages

When deploying to Cloudflare Pages, you'll need to complete a few extra steps before your users can start using your app.

1. Update `vite.config.ts`

Set the `target` value to `cloudflare-pages` in your `vite.config.ts` file.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { tanstackStart } from "@tanstack/solid-start/plugin/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tanstackStart({ target: "cloudflare-module" })],
});
```

2. Add a `wrangler.toml` config file

```toml
# wrangler.toml
name = "your-cloudflare-project-name"
pages_build_output_dir = "./dist"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
compatibility_date = "2024-11-13"
```

Deploy you application to Cloudflare Pages using their one-click deployment process, and you're ready to go!

### Node.js

Set the `target` value to `node-server` in your `vite.config.ts` file.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { tanstackStart } from "@tanstack/solid-start/plugin/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tanstackStart({ target: "node-server" })],
});
```

Then you can run the following command to build and start your application:

```sh
npm run build
```

You're now ready to deploy your application to a Node.js server. You can start your application by running:

```sh
node .output/server/index.mjs
```

### Bun

Make sure that your `solid-js` in your `package.json` file. If not, run the following command to upgrade the packages:

```sh
npm install solid-js
```

Set the `target` value to `bun` in your `vite.config.ts` file.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { tanstackStart } from "@tanstack/solid-start/plugin/vite";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tanstackStart({ target: "bun" })],
});
```

Then you can run the following command to build and start your application:

```sh
bun run build
```

You're now ready to deploy your application to a Bun server. You can start your application by running:

```sh
bun run .output/server/index.mjs
```

id: learn-the-basics
title: Learn the Basics
---

This guide will help you learn the basics behind how TanStack Start works, regardless of how you set up your project.

## Dependencies

TanStack Start is powered by [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router).

- **TanStack Router**: A router for building web applications.
- **Vite**: A build tool for bundling your application.

## It all "Starts" with the Router

This is the file that will dictate the behavior of TanStack Router used within Start. Here, you can configure everything
from the default [preloading functionality](/router/latest/docs/framework/solid/guide/preloading) to [caching staleness](/router/latest/docs/framework/solid/guide/data-loading).

```tsx
// app/router.tsx
import { createRouter as createTanStackRouter } from "@tanstack/solid-router";
import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

export function createRouter() {
  const router = createTanStackRouter({
    routeTree,
    scrollRestoration: true,
  });

  return router;
}

declare module "@tanstack/solid-router" {
  interface Register {
    router: ReturnType<typeof createRouter>;
  }
}
```

- Notice the `scrollRestoration` property. This is used to restore the scroll position of the page when navigating between routes.

## Route Generation

The `routeTree.gen.ts` file is generated when you run TanStack Start (via `npm run dev` or `npm run start`) for the first time. This file contains the generated route tree and a handful of TS utilities that make TanStack Start fully type-safe.

## The Server Entry Point (Optional)

> [!NOTE]
> The server entry point is **optional** out of the box. If not provided, TanStack Start will automatically handle the server entry point for you using the below as a default.

This is done via the `src/server.ts` file:

```tsx
// src/server.ts
import { createStartHandler, defaultStreamHandler } from "@tanstack/solid-start/server";

import { createRouter } from "./router";

export default createStartHandler({
  createRouter,
})(defaultStreamHandler);
```

Whether we are statically generating our app or serving it dynamically, the `server.ts` file is the entry point for doing all SSR-related work.

- It's important that a new router is created for each request. This ensures that any data handled by the router is unique to the request.
- The `defaultStreamHandler` function is used to render our application to a stream, allowing us to take advantage of streaming HTML to the client. (This is the default handler, but you can also use other handlers like `defaultRenderHandler`, or even build your own)

## The Client Entry Point (Optional)

> [!NOTE]
> The client entry point is **optional** out of the box. If not provided, TanStack Start will automatically handle the client entry point for you using the below as a default.

Getting our html to the client is only half the battle. Once there, we need to hydrate our client-side JavaScript once the route resolves to the client. We do this by hydrating the root of our application with the `StartClient` component:

```tsx
// app/client.tsx
import { hydrate } from "solid-js/web";
import { StartClient } from "@tanstack/solid-start";
import { createRouter } from "./router";

const router = createRouter();

hydrate(() => <StartClient router={router} />, document);
```

This enables us to kick off client-side routing once the user's initial server request has fulfilled.

## The Root of Your Application

Other than the client entry point (which is optional by default), the `__root` route of your application is the entry point for your application. The code in this file will wrap all other routes in the app, including your home page. It behaves like a pathless layout route for your whole application.

Because it is **always rendered**, it is the perfect place to construct your application shell and take care of any global logic.

```tsx
// app/routes/__root.tsx
import { Outlet, createRootRoute, HeadContent, Scripts } from "@tanstack/solid-router";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  head: () => ({
    meta: [
      {
        charSet: "utf-8",
      },
      {
        name: "viewport",
        content: "width=device-width, initial-scale=1",
      },
      {
        title: "TanStack Start Starter",
      },
    ],
  }),
  component: RootComponent,
});

function RootComponent() {
  return <Outlet />;
}
```

- This layout may change in the future as we roll out SPA mode, which allows the root route to render the SPA shell without any page-specific content.
- Notice the `Scripts` component. This is used to load all of the client-side JavaScript for the application.

## Routes

Routes are an extensive feature of TanStack Router, and are covered thoroughly in the [Routing Guide](/router/latest/docs/framework/solid/routing/file-based-routing). As a summary:

- Routes are defined using the `createFileRoute` function.
- Routes are automatically code-split and lazy-loaded.
- Critical data fetching is coordinated from a Route's loader
- Much more!

```tsx
// app/routes/index.tsx
import * as fs from "node:fs";
import { createFileRoute, useRouter } from "@tanstack/solid-router";
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/solid-start";

const filePath = "count.txt";

async function readCount() {
  return parseInt(await fs.promises.readFile(filePath, "utf-8").catch(() => "0"));
}

const getCount = createServerFn({
  method: "GET",
}).handler(() => {
  return readCount();
});

const updateCount = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
  .validator((d: number) => d)
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    const count = await readCount();
    await fs.promises.writeFile(filePath, `${count + data}`);
  });

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  component: Home,
  loader: async () => await getCount(),
});

function Home() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const state = Route.useLoaderData();

  return (
    <button
      type="button"
      onClick={() => {
        updateCount({ data: 1 }).then(() => {
          router.invalidate();
        });
      }}
    >
      Add 1 to {state}?
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Navigation

TanStack Start builds 100% on top of TanStack Router, so all of the navigation features of TanStack Router are available to you. In summary:

- Use the `Link` component to navigate to a new route.
- Use the `useNavigate` hook to navigate imperatively.
- Use the `useRouter` hook anywhere in your application to access the router instance and perform invalidations.
- Every router hook that returns state is reactive, meaning it will automatically re-run when the appropriate state changes.

Here's a quick example of how you can use the `Link` component to navigate to a new route:

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/solid-router";

function Home() {
  return <Link to="/about">About</Link>;
}
```

For more in-depth information on navigation, check out the [navigation guide](/router/latest/docs/framework/solid/guide/navigation).

## Server Functions (RPCs)

You may have noticed the **server function** we created above using `createServerFn`. This is one of TanStack's most powerful features, allowing you to create server-side functions that can be called from both the server during SSR and the client!

Here's a quick overview of how server functions work:

- Server functions are created using the `createServerFn` function.
- They can be called from both the server during SSR and the client.
- They can be used to fetch data from the server, or to perform other server-side actions.

Here's a quick example of how you can use server functions to fetch and return data from the server:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/solid-start";
import * as fs from "node:fs";
import { z } from "zod";

const getUserById = createServerFn({ method: "GET" })
  // Always validate data sent to the function, here we use Zod
  .validator(z.string())
  // The handler function is where you perform the server-side logic
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    return db.query.users.findFirst({ where: eq(users.id, data) });
  });

// Somewhere else in your application
const user = await getUserById({ data: "1" });
```

To learn more about server functions, check out the [server functions guide](../server-functions).

### Mutations

Server Functions can also be used to perform mutations on the server. This is also done using the same `createServerFn` function, but with the additional requirement that you invalidate any data on the client that was affected by the mutation.

- If you're using TanStack Router only, you can use the `router.invalidate()` method to invalidate all router data and re-fetch it.
- If you're using TanStack Query, you can use the `queryClient.invalidateQueries()` method to invalidate data, among other more specific methods to target specific queries.

Here's a quick example of how you can use server functions to perform a mutation on the server and invalidate the data on the client:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/solid-start";

const UserSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  name: z.string(),
});

const updateUser = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
  .validator(UserSchema)
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    return db.update(users).set({ name: data.name }).where(eq(users.id, data.id));
  });

// Somewhere else in your application
await updateUser({ data: { id: "1", name: "John" } });
```

To learn more about mutations, check out the [mutations guide](/router/latest/docs/framework/solid/guide/data-mutations).

## Data Loading

Another powerful feature of TanStack Router is data loading. This allows you to fetch data for SSR and preload route data before it is rendered. This is done using the `loader` function of a route.

Here's a quick overview of how data loading works:

- Data loading is done using the `loader` function of a route.
- Data loaders are **isomorphic**, meaning they are executed on both the server and the client.
- For performing server-only logic, call a server function from within the loader.
- Similar to TanStack Query, data loaders are cached on the client and are re-used and even re-fetched in the background when the data is stale.

To learn more about data loading, check out the [data loading guide](/router/latest/docs/framework/solid/guide/data-loading).

id: selective-ssr
title: Selective Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
---

## What is Selective SSR?

In TanStack Start, routes matching the initial request are rendered on the server by default. This means `beforeLoad` and `loader` are executed on the server, followed by rendering the route components. The resulting HTML is sent to the client, which hydrates the markup into a fully interactive application.

However, there are cases where you might want to disable SSR for certain routes or all routes, such as:

- When `beforeLoad` or `loader` requires browser-only APIs (e.g., `localStorage`).
- When the route component depends on browser-only APIs (e.g., `canvas`).

TanStack Start's Selective SSR feature lets you configure:

- Which routes should execute `beforeLoad` or `loader` on the server.
- Which route components should be rendered on the server.

## How does this compare to SPA mode?

TanStack Start's [SPA mode](../spa-mode) completely disables server-side execution of `beforeLoad` and `loader`, as well as server-side rendering of route components. Selective SSR allows you to configure server-side handling on a per-route basis, either statically or dynamically.

## Configuration

You can control how a route is handled during the initial server request using the `ssr` property. If this property is not set, it defaults to `true`. You can change this default using the `defaultSsr` option in `createRouter`:

```tsx
// src/router.tsx
import { createRouter as createTanStackRouter } from "@tanstack/solid-router";
import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

export function createRouter() {
  const router = createTanStackRouter({
    routeTree,
    scrollRestoration: true,
    defaultPendingComponent: () => <div>Loading...</div>,
    // Disable SSR by default
    defaultSsr: false,
  });

  return router;
}
```

### `ssr: true`

This is the default behavior unless otherwise configured. On the initial request, it will:

- Run `beforeLoad` on the server and send the resulting context to the client.
- Run `loader` on the server and send the loader data to the client.
- Render the component on the server and send the HTML markup to the client.

```tsx
// src/routes/posts/$postId.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  ssr: true,
  beforeLoad: () => {
    console.log("Executes on the server during the initial request");
    console.log("Executes on the client for subsequent navigation");
  },
  loader: () => {
    console.log("Executes on the server during the initial request");
    console.log("Executes on the client for subsequent navigation");
  },
  component: () => <div>This component is rendered on the client</div>,
});
```

### `ssr: false`

This disables server-side:

- Execution of the route's `beforeLoad` and `loader`.
- Rendering of the route component.

```tsx
// src/routes/posts/$postId.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  ssr: false,
  beforeLoad: () => {
    console.log("Executes on the client during hydration");
  },
  loader: () => {
    console.log("Executes on the client during hydration");
  },
  component: () => <div>This component is rendered on the client</div>,
});
```

### `ssr: 'data-only'`

This hybrid option will:

- Run `beforeLoad` on the server and send the resulting context to the client.
- Run `loader` on the server and send the loader data to the client.
- Disable server-side rendering of the route component.

```tsx
// src/routes/posts/$postId.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts/$postId")({
  ssr: "data-only",
  beforeLoad: () => {
    console.log("Executes on the server during the initial request");
    console.log("Executes on the client for subsequent navigation");
  },
  loader: () => {
    console.log("Executes on the server during the initial request");
    console.log("Executes on the client for subsequent navigation");
  },
  component: () => <div>This component is rendered on the client</div>,
});
```

### Functional Form

For more flexibility, you can use the functional form of the `ssr` property to decide at runtime whether to SSR a route:

```tsx
// src/routes/docs/$docType/$docId.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/docs/$docType/$docId")({
  validateSearch: z.object({ details: z.boolean().optional() }),
  ssr: ({ params, search }) => {
    if (params.status === "success" && params.value.docType === "sheet") {
      return false;
    }
    if (search.status === "success" && search.value.details) {
      return "data-only";
    }
  },
  beforeLoad: () => {
    console.log("Executes on the server depending on the result of ssr()");
  },
  loader: () => {
    console.log("Executes on the server depending on the result of ssr()");
  },
  component: () => <div>This component is rendered on the client</div>,
});
```

The `ssr` function runs only on the server during the initial request and is stripped from the client bundle.

`search` and `params` are passed in after validation as a discriminated union:

```tsx
params:
    | { status: 'success'; value: Expand<ResolveAllParamsFromParent<TParentRoute, TParams>> }
    | { status: 'error'; error: unknown }
search:
    | { status: 'success'; value: Expand<ResolveFullSearchSchema<TParentRoute, TSearchValidator>> }
    | { status: 'error'; error: unknown }
```

If validation fails, `status` will be `error` and `error` will contain the failure details. Otherwise, `status` will be `success` and `value` will contain the validated data.

### Inheritance

At runtime, a child route inherits the Selective SSR configuration of its parent. For example:

```tsx
root { ssr: undefined }
  posts { ssr: false }
     $postId { ssr: true }
```

- `root` defaults to `ssr: true`.
- `posts` explicitly sets `ssr: false`, so neither `beforeLoad` nor `loader` will run on the server, and the route component won't be rendered on the server.
- `$postId` sets `ssr: true`, but inherits `ssr: false` from its parent.

Another example:

```tsx
root { ssr: undefined }
  posts { ssr: 'data-only' }
     $postId { ssr: true }
       details { ssr: false }
```

- `root` defaults to `ssr: true`.
- `posts` sets `ssr: 'data-only'`, so `beforeLoad` and `loader` run on the server, but the route component isn't rendered on the server.
- `$postId` sets `ssr: true`, but inherits `ssr: 'data-only'` from its parent.
- `details` sets `ssr: false`, so neither `beforeLoad` nor `loader` will run on the server, and the route component won't be rendered on the server.

## Fallback Rendering

For the first route with `ssr: false` or `ssr: 'data-only'`, the server will render the route's `pendingComponent` as a fallback. If `pendingComponent` isn't configured, the `defaultPendingComponent` will be rendered. If neither is configured, no fallback will be rendered.

On the client during hydration, this fallback will be displayed for at least `minPendingMs` (or `defaultPendingMinMs` if not configured), even if the route doesn't have `beforeLoad` or `loader` defined.

_So you want to use Tailwind CSS in your TanStack Start project?_

This guide will help you use Tailwind CSS in your TanStack Start project.

## Tailwind CSS Version 4 (Latest)

The latest version of Tailwind CSS is 4. And it has some configuration changes that majorly differ from Tailwind CSS Version 3. It's **easier and recommended** to set up Tailwind CSS Version 4 in a TanStack Start project, as TanStack Start uses Vite as its build tool.

### Install Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind CSS and it's Vite plugin.

```shell
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
```

### Configure The Vite Plugin

Add the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin to your Vite configuration.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import tsConfigPaths from "vite-tsconfig-paths";
import { tanstackStart } from "@tanstack/solid-start/plugin/vite";
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    port: 3000,
  },
  plugins: [tsConfigPaths(), tanstackStart(), tailwindcss()],
});
```

### Import Tailwind in your CSS file

You need to create a CSS file to configure Tailwind CSS instead of the configuration file in version 4. You can do this by creating a `src/styles/app.css` file or name it whatever you want.

```css
/* src/styles/app.css */
@import "tailwindcss";
```

## Import the CSS file in your `__root.tsx` file

Import the CSS file in your `__root.tsx` file with the `?url` query and make sure to add the **triple slash** directive to the top of the file.

```tsx
// src/routes/__root.tsx
/// <reference types="vite/client" />
// other imports...

import appCss from "../styles/app.css?url";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  head: () => ({
    meta: [
      // your meta tags and site config
    ],
    links: [{ rel: "stylesheet", href: appCss }],
    // other head config
  }),
  component: RootComponent,
});
```

## Use Tailwind CSS anywhere in your project

You can now use Tailwind CSS anywhere in your project.

```tsx
// src/routes/index.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/solid-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  component: Home,
});

function Home() {
  return <div className="bg-red-500 p-4 text-white">Hello World</div>;
}
```

That's it! You can now use Tailwind CSS anywhere in your project 🎉.

## Tailwind CSS Version 3 (Legacy)

If you are want to use Tailwind CSS Version 3, you can use the following steps.

### Install Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind CSS and it's peer dependencies.

```shell
npm install -D tailwindcss@3 postcss autoprefixer
```

Then generate the Tailwind and PostCSS configuration files.

```shell
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

### Configure your template paths

Add the paths to all of your template files in the `tailwind.config.js` file.

```js
// tailwind.config.js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

### Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS file

Add the `@tailwind` directives for each of Tailwind's layers to your `src/styles/app.css` file.

```css
/* src/styles/app.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

# Authentication Custom Fields Documentation

## Overview

This document explains how custom user fields are handled in the Solstice application, which uses Better Auth for authentication with custom profile fields stored in the database.

## The Challenge

Better Auth's session only returns a subset of user fields by default:

- `id`
- `name`
- `email`
- `emailVerified`
- `createdAt`
- `updatedAt`
- `image`

However, our application requires additional custom fields for user profiles:

- `profileComplete` - Track if user has completed onboarding
- `dateOfBirth` - Required profile field
- `emergencyContact` - Required for sports leagues (JSON)
- `gender`, `pronouns`, `phone` - Optional profile fields
- `privacySettings` - User privacy preferences (JSON)
- `profileVersion`, `profileUpdatedAt` - Audit fields

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Database Schema (`src/db/schema/auth.schema.ts`)

The user table includes all custom fields with appropriate defaults:

```typescript
export const user = pgTable("user", {
  // Better Auth core fields
  id: text("id").primaryKey(),
  name: text("name").notNull(),
  email: text("email").notNull().unique(),
  // ... other core fields ...

  // Custom profile fields
  profileComplete: boolean("profile_complete")
    .$defaultFn(() => false)
    .notNull(),
  dateOfBirth: timestamp("date_of_birth"),
  emergencyContact: text("emergency_contact"), // JSON string
  // ... other custom fields ...
});
```

### 2. Extended User Type (`src/lib/auth/types.ts`)

We define our own User interface that extends Better Auth's base User type:

```typescript
import type { User as BetterAuthUser } from "better-auth";

export interface User extends BetterAuthUser {
  profileComplete: boolean;
  dateOfBirth?: Date | null;
  emergencyContact?: string | null;
  // ... other custom fields ...
}
```

### 3. User Data Fetching (`src/features/auth/auth.queries.ts`)

A server function fetches the complete user data by:

1. Getting the session from Better Auth
2. Querying the database for the full user record
3. Mapping the database fields to our extended User type

```typescript
export const getCurrentUser = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(
  async (): Promise<User | null> => {
    const session = await auth.api.getSession({ headers });

    if (!session?.user) {
      return null;
    }

    // Fetch full user data from database
    const dbUser = await db()
      .select()
      .from(user)
      .where(eq(user.id, session.user.id))
      .limit(1);

    // Map to extended User type
    return {
      ...session.user,
      profileComplete: dbUser[0].profileComplete,
      // ... other custom fields ...
    };
  },
);
```

### 4. Route Context (`src/routes/__root.tsx`)

The root route uses `getCurrentUser` to provide the full user data to all child routes:

```typescript
beforeLoad: async ({ context }) => {
  const user = await getCurrentUser();
  return { user };
};
```

## Usage in Components

Components can now access all custom fields through the route context:

```typescript
// In route beforeLoad
const { user } = context;
if (!user.profileComplete) {
  throw redirect({ to: "/onboarding" });
}

// In components
const { user } = useRouteContext();
console.log(user.profileComplete); // ✅ TypeScript knows about this field
```

## Key Decisions

1. **No Type Augmentation**: We don't augment Better Auth's types directly, as this can cause type conflicts
2. **Database Query**: We accept the small overhead of an extra database query to get full user data
3. **Centralized Fetching**: All user data fetching goes through `getCurrentUser` for consistency
4. **Type Safety**: Our extended User type provides full type safety for custom fields

## Migration Notes

When adding new user fields:

1. Add the field to the database schema
2. Update the User interface in `src/lib/auth/types.ts`
3. Update the mapping in `getCurrentUser`
4. Run database migrations

# Code Pattern Improvements

This document outlines the code pattern improvements implemented in the Solstice sports league management platform.

## Critical: Process Not Defined Error Analysis (UPDATED)

### Problem Summary

The application experiences a `ReferenceError: process is not defined` error in the browser console. This occurs because server-only code that accesses `process.env` is being included in the client bundle.

### Current State (July 26, 2025)

Despite implementing the recommended fix of moving all server-only imports inside server function handlers, the error persisted. The error originated from TanStack Start's own client-side server function RPC mechanism:

```
ReferenceError: process is not defined
    at createClientRpc (http://localhost:5173/node_modules/.vite/deps/@tanstack_react-start_server-functions-client.js?v=43a3a00e:114:41)
    at http://localhost:5173/src/features/auth/auth.queries.ts:3:47
```

### Root Causes

1. **TanStack Start's server function compiler behavior**: The framework only strips code inside the `handler()` function, not module-level imports.

2. **New Issue: TanStack Start Client RPC**: The framework's client-side RPC mechanism itself is trying to access `process.env`, possibly for development/production mode detection.

### Attempted Fix (Partially Successful)

We moved all server-only imports inside handler functions:

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD - Import only when handler executes on server
export const getCurrentUser = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(async () => {
  // Import server-only modules inside the handler
  const [{ getDb }, { getAuth }] = await Promise.all([
    import("~/db/server-helpers"),
    import("~/lib/auth/server-helpers"),
  ]);

  const db = await getDb();
  const auth = await getAuth();
  // ... rest of the code
});
```

### Files Successfully Updated

1. `src/features/auth/auth.queries.ts`
2. `src/features/profile/profile.queries.ts`
3. `src/features/profile/profile.mutations.ts`
4. `src/features/membership/membership.queries.ts`
5. `src/features/membership/membership.mutations.ts`
6. `src/routes/api/auth/$.ts`
7. `src/routes/api/auth/$action/$provider.ts`
8. `src/lib/auth/middleware/auth-guard.ts`
9. `src/routes/api/health.ts`

### Remaining Issues

1. **TanStack Start Client Bug**: The framework's own client code is accessing `process.env`
2. **Possible Solutions**:
   - Define `process.env` globally in the client build
   - Update to a newer version of TanStack Start that fixes this
   - Use a Vite plugin to polyfill process
   - Report this as a bug to TanStack team

### CSP Implementation (New Addition)

To address the Content Security Policy issues without hard-coded hashes, we implemented a nonce-based solution:

1. **Created `src/server.ts`**: Generates per-request nonces and sets CSP headers
2. **Updated `src/router.tsx`**: Passes nonce through context
3. **Updated `src/routes/__root.tsx`**: Uses nonce in Scripts and HeadContent components

This eliminates the need for hard-coded SHA-256 hashes in the CSP header.

### Temporary Workarounds

1. **For Development**: The error doesn't prevent the app from working in development mode.

2. **For Production**: Consider adding this to your HTML template or Vite config:

   ```javascript
   // Define a minimal process.env for client code
   window.process = { env: { NODE_ENV: "production" } };
   ```

3. **Vite Plugin Solution** (IMPLEMENTED):

   ```typescript
   // vite.config.ts
   import { defineConfig } from "vite";

   export default defineConfig({
     define: {
       "process.env": {},
     },
   });
   ```

   **Status**: ✅ This fix has been implemented in vite.config.ts on July 26, 2025.

### Resolution Summary

The issue has been resolved by implementing the Vite `define` solution, which provides a minimal `process.env` object at build time. This is the cleanest fix with:

- **Zero runtime cost** (resolved at build time)
- **Minimal bundle impact** (≤ 30 bytes)
- **No polyfill overhead** (5-12 KB saved vs polyfill plugins)

The fix is safe because our codebase only has one instance of client-side `process.env` usage (from TanStack Start's RPC mechanism).

### Next Steps

1. **Monitor TanStack Start Updates**: Watch for future versions that use `import.meta.env` instead
2. **Consider Filing Issue**: Share feedback with TanStack team about Vite 6 compatibility
3. **Remove Temporary Workarounds**: Clean up any runtime shims or defensive code added during debugging

### Prevention Strategies

1. **Always use dynamic imports** in server functions
2. **Test in production build** regularly
3. **Use lint rules** to catch server imports in client code
4. **Document the pattern** for team members

## 1. Auth Client Facade Pattern

### Before

```typescript
import authClient from "~/lib/auth-client";

// Usage
authClient.signIn.email({ ... });
authClient.signIn.social({ ... });
```

### After

```typescript
import { auth } from "~/lib/auth-client";

// Usage
auth.signIn.email({ ... });
auth.signInWithOAuth({ ... });
```

### Benefits

- **Cleaner API**: The facade provides a more intuitive interface with better method names
- **Encapsulation**: Internal implementation details are hidden from consumers
- **Flexibility**: Easy to swap auth providers or add middleware without changing consumer code
- **Type Safety**: Better IntelliSense support with explicit method exports

## 2. Theme Management with useTheme Hook

### Before

```typescript
// Direct DOM manipulation
function toggleTheme() {
  if (
    document.documentElement.classList.contains("dark") ||
    (!("theme" in localStorage) &&
      window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches)
  ) {
    document.documentElement.classList.remove("dark");
    localStorage.theme = "light";
  } else {
    document.documentElement.classList.add("dark");
    localStorage.theme = "dark";
  }
}
```

### After

```typescript
import { useTheme } from "~/shared/hooks/useTheme";

// Usage
const { theme, resolvedTheme, toggleTheme, setTheme } = useTheme();
```

### Features

- **System Theme Support**: Respects user's OS preferences
- **Reactive Updates**: Automatically responds to system theme changes
- **Persistent State**: Saves user preference to localStorage
- **Type Safety**: Strongly typed theme values ("light" | "dark" | "system")
- **Clean API**: Simple toggle and set methods

## 3. Centralized Icon Management

### Before

```typescript
// Icons imported directly in components
import { MoonIcon, SunIcon } from "lucide-react";

// SVG icons hardcoded in components
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
  <path d="..." fill="currentColor" />
</svg>
```

### After

```typescript
import { GitHubIcon, GoogleIcon, MoonIcon, SunIcon } from "~/shared/ui/icons";

// Usage
<GitHubIcon />
<GoogleIcon />
```

### Benefits

- **Consistency**: All icons in one place for easy management
- **Reusability**: Icons can be used across components without duplication
- **Performance**: SVG icons are optimized and consistent in size
- **Maintainability**: Easy to update or replace icons globally
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript support for all icon props

## 4. Authentication Route Guards

### Before

```typescript
// Manual authentication checks in each component
if (!user) {
  navigate({ to: "/login" });
  return;
}
```

### After

```typescript
import { useAuthGuard } from "~/features/auth/useAuthGuard";

// Protected route
useAuthGuard({ user, requireAuth: true });

// Public route that redirects authenticated users
useAuthGuard({ user, redirectAuthenticated: true });

// With callbacks
useAuthGuard({
  user,
  requireAuth: true,
  onAuthSuccess: (user) => console.log("Welcome", user.name),
  onAuthFail: () => console.log("Access denied"),
});
```

### Features

- **Declarative Guards**: Simple API for protecting routes
- **Redirect Support**: Automatic redirects with preserved return URLs
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customizable redirect paths and callbacks
- **HOC Support**: `withAuthGuard` for wrapping components
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with Better Auth types

## Migration Guide

### Updating Auth Imports

```typescript
// Old
import authClient from "~/lib/auth/auth-client";
await authClient.signOut();

// New
import { auth } from "~/lib/auth-client";
await auth.signOut();
```

### Updating Theme Toggle

```typescript
// Old
<ThemeToggle /> // Works as before, now uses useTheme internally

// New (if you need theme state)
const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();
```

### Updating Icons

```typescript
// Old
import { LoaderCircle } from "lucide-react";
<LoaderCircle className="animate-spin" />

// New
import { LoaderIcon } from "~/shared/ui/icons";
<LoaderIcon className="animate-spin" />
```

### Protecting Routes

```typescript
// In your route component
export const Route = createFileRoute("/dashboard")({
  component: Dashboard,
  loader: ({ context }) => ({ user: context.user }),
});

function Dashboard() {
  const { user } = Route.useLoaderData();
  const { isAuthenticated } = useAuthGuard({ user });

  // Component is protected
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use the auth facade** instead of importing the raw auth client
2. **Use useTheme hook** for any theme-related functionality
3. **Import icons from the centralized icons file** to maintain consistency
4. **Apply route guards** at the route level for better security
5. **Keep the auth client facade updated** when adding new auth methods
6. **Document any custom icons** added to the icons file

## Future Improvements

- Add more OAuth providers to the auth facade
- Extend useTheme with more theme options (e.g., color schemes)
- Create an icon sprite system for better performance
- Add role-based access control to useAuthGuard
- Implement auth state persistence across tabs

# E2E Testing Best Practices & Pitfalls

This guide covers best practices and common pitfalls when writing and maintaining E2E tests for Solstice.

## Running E2E Tests

### Pre-commit Testing

Before committing changes to main, run the full Chromium E2E test suite:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e --reporter=html --output=e2e-test-results --workers 1 --project=chromium-unauthenticated --project=chromium-authenticated
```

### Development Testing

For faster iteration during development:

```bash
# Run specific test file
pnpm test:e2e path/to/test.spec.ts

# Run in UI mode for debugging
pnpm test:e2e:ui

# Run only failed tests
pnpm test:e2e --last-failed
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Data Isolation

- Always clean up test data before and after tests
- Use unique test users for different scenarios
- Never rely on data from previous test runs

```typescript
test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
  await clearUserTeams(page, process.env.E2E_TEST_EMAIL!);
});

test.afterEach(async ({ page }) => {
  try {
    await clearUserTeams(page, process.env.E2E_TEST_EMAIL!);
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn("Cleanup failed:", error);
  }
});
```

### 2. Selector Best Practices

- Use semantic selectors: `getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText`
- Avoid CSS selectors unless absolutely necessary
- Use exact text matching when needed to avoid ambiguity

```typescript
// Good
await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Submit" }).click();
await page.getByLabel("Email").fill("test@example.com");

// Avoid
await page.locator(".submit-btn").click();
```

### 3. Wait Strategies

- Use proper wait conditions instead of arbitrary timeouts
- Wait for specific elements or navigation events
- Use `waitForLoadState` sparingly

```typescript
// Good
await page.waitForURL("/dashboard");
await expect(page.getByRole("heading")).toBeVisible();

// Avoid
await page.waitForTimeout(5000);
```

### 4. Test Structure

- Keep tests focused on user journeys
- Test one feature per test file
- Use descriptive test names

```typescript
test.describe("Team Management", () => {
  test("should create a new team", async ({ page }) => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  test("should edit team details", async ({ page }) => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### 1. Strict Mode Violations

**Problem**: Multiple elements match a selector

```typescript
// Error: strict mode violation
await page.getByText("Active").click();
```

**Solution**: Use exact matching or more specific selectors

```typescript
await page.getByText("Active", { exact: true }).click();
// or
await page.getByRole("status").filter({ hasText: "Active" }).click();
```

### 2. Race Conditions

**Problem**: Test fails intermittently due to timing issues

```typescript
await page.click("button");
// May fail if navigation hasn't completed
await expect(page.getByRole("heading")).toBeVisible();
```

**Solution**: Wait for navigation or state changes

```typescript
await page.click("button");
await page.waitForURL("/new-page");
await expect(page.getByRole("heading")).toBeVisible();
```

### 3. Shared Authentication State

**Problem**: Tests interfere with each other's auth state

**Solution**: Use separate storage states or test users

```typescript
// For tests needing fresh auth
test.use({ storageState: undefined });

// Use different test users for different scenarios
const TEST_USERS = {
  general: "test@example.com",
  teamCreator: "teamcreator@example.com",
  profileEdit: "profile-edit@example.com",
};
```

### 4. Database State Dependencies

**Problem**: Tests fail when database state changes

**Solution**: Always seed required data in test setup

```typescript
test.beforeEach(async () => {
  // Seed required data
  await seedTestData();
});
```

### 5. Form Validation Timing

**Problem**: Form validation happens asynchronously

**Solution**: Wait for validation messages

```typescript
await page.getByLabel("Email").fill("invalid");
await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Submit" }).click();
// Wait for validation
await expect(page.getByText("Invalid email")).toBeVisible();
```

## Using MCP Playwright for Debugging

Before writing or updating E2E tests, use MCP Playwright to verify behavior:

1. Check if dev server is running: `curl -s http://localhost:5173/api/health`
2. If browser already in use, close it: `mcp__playwright__browser_close`
3. Navigate and interact: `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`, `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot`

This ensures tests match actual application behavior.

## Test User Management

Dedicated test users are seeded via `scripts/seed-e2e-data.ts`:

- `test@example.com` - General authenticated tests
- `teamcreator@example.com` - Team creation (no existing teams)
- `profile-edit@example.com` - Profile editing tests

Each user has specific data states to support different test scenarios.

## Performance Considerations

- Run tests with `--workers 1` for consistent execution
- Use `--reporter=html` for detailed failure analysis
- Output results to `e2e-test-results` for easy inspection
- Firefox tests are currently excluded due to compatibility issues

## Maintenance Tips

1. **Regular Updates**: Update selectors when UI changes
2. **Seed Script**: Keep `seed-e2e-data.ts` in sync with test expectations
3. **Route Changes**: Update navigation assertions when routes change
4. **Validation Changes**: Update error message assertions when validation rules change
5. **New Features**: Add E2E tests for all new user-facing features

## Architecture Overview

### TanStack Form Integration

All forms use TanStack Form for:

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with form state
- **Field Validation**: Real-time validation with error handling
- **Form State Management**: Automatic form state tracking
- **Performance**: Optimized re-renders and change tracking

### Validation Strategy

1. **Zod Schemas** (Preferred): Runtime validation with type inference
2. **Inline Validation** (Legacy): Direct validator functions in field definitions

### Component Pattern

```tsx
// Standard form implementation pattern
const form = useForm({
  defaultValues: {
    /* initial values */
  },
  onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
    // Handle form submission
  },
});

// Field usage pattern
<form.Field name="fieldName" validators={{ onChange: schema.parse }}>
  {(field) => <ValidatedInput field={field} label="Field Label" />}
</form.Field>;
```

## Form Field Components

### ValidatedInput

**Location**: `src/components/form-fields/ValidatedInput.tsx`

**Features**:

- All HTML input types supported
- Real-time validation display
- Loading state integration
- Accessibility features (ARIA labels, error descriptions)

**Usage**:

```tsx
<form.Field name="email" validators={{ onChange: emailSchema.parse }}>
  {(field) => (
    <ValidatedInput
      field={field}
      label="Email Address"
      type="email"
      placeholder="user@example.com"
      autoComplete="email"
    />
  )}
</form.Field>
```

### ValidatedSelect

**Location**: `src/components/form-fields/ValidatedSelect.tsx`

**Features**:

- Dropdown selection with validation
- Custom option arrays
- Placeholder support

**Usage**:

```tsx
const options = [
  { value: "option1", label: "Option 1" },
  { value: "option2", label: "Option 2" },
];

<form.Field name="selection">
  {(field) => (
    <ValidatedSelect
      field={field}
      label="Choose Option"
      options={options}
      placeholderText="Select an option"
    />
  )}
</form.Field>;
```

### ValidatedCheckbox

**Location**: `src/components/form-fields/ValidatedCheckbox.tsx`

**Features**:

- Boolean value handling
- Optional descriptions
- Accessibility compliance

**Usage**:

```tsx
<form.Field name="agreement">
  {(field) => (
    <ValidatedCheckbox
      field={field}
      label="I agree to the terms and conditions"
      description="Required to proceed with registration"
    />
  )}
</form.Field>
```

### ValidatedDatePicker

**Location**: `src/components/form-fields/ValidatedDatePicker.tsx`

**Features**:

- Age validation (min/max age constraints)
- Automatic date range calculation
- HTML5 date input with fallbacks

**Usage**:

```tsx
<form.Field name="dateOfBirth" validators={{ onChange: dateSchema.parse }}>
  {(field) => (
    <ValidatedDatePicker field={field} label="Date of Birth" minAge={13} maxAge={120} />
  )}
</form.Field>
```

## Validation Patterns

### Zod Schema Pattern (Recommended)

```tsx
// Define schema
const userSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1, "Name is required"),
  email: z.string().email("Invalid email format"),
  age: z.number().min(13, "Must be at least 13 years old"),
});

// Use in form
const form = useForm({
  defaultValues: { name: "", email: "", age: 0 },
  onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
    const validated = userSchema.parse(value); // Runtime validation
    await submitUser(validated);
  },
});

// Field validation
<form.Field
  name="email"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) => {
      try {
        userSchema.shape.email.parse(value);
        return undefined;
      } catch (error) {
        return error.errors[0]?.message;
      }
    },
  }}
>
  {(field) => <ValidatedInput field={field} label="Email" />}
</form.Field>;
```

### Server Function Validation

```tsx
// Server function with Zod validation
export const createUser = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
  .validator(userSchema.parse)
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    // data is fully typed and validated
    return await database.users.create(data);
  });
```

### Cross-Field Validation

```tsx
// Password confirmation validation
<form.Field
  name="confirmPassword"
  validators={{
    onChangeListenTo: ["password"],
    onChange: ({ value, fieldApi }) => {
      if (value !== fieldApi.form.getFieldValue("password")) {
        return "Passwords do not match";
      }
      return undefined;
    },
  }}
>
  {(field) => <ValidatedInput field={field} type="password" />}
</form.Field>
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Schema-First Validation

**✅ Do**:

```tsx
const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email("Invalid email"),
});

<form.Field name="email" validators={{ onChange: schema.shape.email.parse }}>
```

**❌ Don't**:

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="email"
  validators={{
    onChange: ({ value }) => !value ? "Email required" : undefined
  }}
>
```

### 2. Consistent Error Handling

**✅ Do**:

```tsx
const form = useForm({
  onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
    try {
      const result = await submitData(value);
      if (result.success) {
        navigate("/success");
      } else {
        setError(result.errors?.[0]?.message || "Unknown error");
      }
    } catch (error) {
      setError("Network error occurred");
    }
  },
});
```

### 3. Loading State Management

**✅ Do**:

```tsx
<FormSubmitButton isSubmitting={form.state.isSubmitting} loadingText="Saving...">
  Save Changes
</FormSubmitButton>
```

### 4. Accessibility

**✅ Do**:

- Always provide labels
- Use proper input types
- Include error descriptions
- Support keyboard navigation

### 5. Performance

**✅ Do**:

- Use `onChangeAsyncDebounceMs` for expensive validation
- Minimize re-renders with proper field scoping
- Use `form.reset()` instead of setting individual fields

## Migration Guide

### From useState to TanStack Form

**Before** (useState pattern):

```tsx
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({ name: "", email: "" });
const [errors, setErrors] = useState({});

const handleSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  // Manual validation and submission
};

<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  <input
    value={formData.name}
    onChange={(e) => setFormData((prev) => ({ ...prev, name: e.target.value }))}
  />
</form>;
```

**After** (TanStack Form):

```tsx
const form = useForm({
  defaultValues: { name: "", email: "" },
  onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
    await submitData(value);
  },
});

<form
  onSubmit={(e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    form.handleSubmit();
  }}
>
  <form.Field name="name">
    {(field) => <ValidatedInput field={field} label="Name" />}
  </form.Field>
</form>;
```

### Adding Validation

**Step 1**: Create Zod schema

```tsx
const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1, "Name required"),
  email: z.string().email("Invalid email"),
});
```

**Step 2**: Apply to fields

```tsx
<form.Field
  name="email"
  validators={{ onChange: schema.shape.email.parse }}
>
```

## Common Patterns

### Multi-Step Forms

```tsx
const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(0);
const form = useForm({
  onSubmit: async ({ value }) => {
    if (currentStep < steps.length - 1) {
      setCurrentStep((prev) => prev + 1);
      return;
    }
    await submitFinalForm(value);
  },
});
```

### Conditional Fields

```tsx
const showPhoneField = form.getFieldValue("contactMethod") === "phone";

{
  showPhoneField && (
    <form.Field name="phone">
      {(field) => <ValidatedInput field={field} type="tel" />}
    </form.Field>
  );
}
```

### Dynamic Field Arrays

```tsx
// For complex arrays, consider using form.Field with array syntax
<form.Field name={`items.${index}.name`}>
  {(field) => <ValidatedInput field={field} />}
</form.Field>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Field not updating**

- Check field name matches form structure
- Ensure proper field prop passing to components

**2. Validation not working**

- Verify Zod schema syntax
- Check error handling in validator functions

**3. Form not submitting**

- Confirm `form.handleSubmit()` is called
- Check for validation errors preventing submission

**4. TypeScript errors**

- Ensure form types match schema inference
- Use proper type assertions for complex nested objects

### Debug Tools

```tsx
// Form state debugging
console.log("Form state:", form.state);
console.log("Field value:", form.getFieldValue("fieldName"));
console.log("Form errors:", form.state.errors);
```

### Performance Issues

```tsx
// Add debouncing for expensive validation
<form.Field
  name="search"
  validators={{
    onChangeAsyncDebounceMs: 300,
    onChangeAsync: async ({ value }) => {
      return await validateSearch(value);
    },
  }}
>
```

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Migration**: Update remaining forms to use Zod schemas
2. **Enhanced Components**: Add more specialized form components as needed
3. **Form Templates**: Create reusable form templates for common patterns
4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive form testing utilities
5. **Documentation**: Keep this guide updated as patterns evolve

# Rate Limiting with TanStack Pacer

This document describes how we use TanStack Pacer for client-side rate limiting in the Solstice application.

## Overview

TanStack Pacer provides client-side rate limiting to prevent users from overwhelming the server with too many requests. This is complementary to server-side rate limiting and provides immediate user feedback.

## Key Concepts

### Client-Side vs Server-Side Rate Limiting

- **Client-Side (TanStack Pacer)**: Prevents requests from being sent, provides immediate user feedback, improves UX
- **Server-Side (Existing middleware)**: Final protection layer, prevents abuse, works across all clients

Both layers work together for comprehensive protection.

### Rate Limit Types

We have predefined rate limit configurations in `src/lib/pacer/rate-limit-config.ts`:

| Type       | Limit | Window     | Window Type | Use Case                          |
| ---------- | ----- | ---------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| `auth`     | 5     | 15 minutes | Fixed       | Login, signup, password reset     |
| `api`      | 100   | 1 minute   | Sliding     | General API calls                 |
| `search`   | 10    | 10 seconds | Sliding     | Search operations                 |
| `mutation` | 20    | 1 minute   | Fixed       | Create, update, delete operations |

### Window Types

- **Fixed Window**: Resets completely after the window period
- **Sliding Window**: Gradually allows new requests as old ones expire

## Usage Guide

### Basic Usage with Server Functions

```typescript
import { useRateLimitedServerFn } from "~/lib/pacer/hooks";
import { myServerFunction } from "~/features/myfeature/mutations";

function MyComponent() {
  // Apply rate limiting to any server function
  const rateLimitedFn = useRateLimitedServerFn(
    myServerFunction,
    { type: "api" }, // or "auth", "search", "mutation"
  );

  const handleAction = async () => {
    try {
      const result = await rateLimitedFn({
        data: {
          /* ... */
        },
      });
      // Handle success
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle server errors (rate limit errors show toast automatically)
    }
  };
}
```

### Search Operations

For search operations, use the specialized hook:

```typescript
import { useRateLimitedSearch } from "~/lib/pacer/hooks";

function SearchComponent() {
  const rateLimitedSearch = useRateLimitedSearch(
    async (query: string) => {
      return await searchServerFn({ data: { query } });
    }
  );

  return (
    <input
      onChange={(e) => rateLimitedSearch(e.target.value)}
      placeholder="Search..."
    />
  );
}
```

### Custom Rate Limiting

For custom configurations:

```typescript
import { useAsyncRateLimitedCallback } from "@tanstack/react-pacer";

function CustomComponent() {
  const rateLimitedAction = useAsyncRateLimitedCallback(
    async (data: any) => {
      return await myServerFunction({ data });
    },
    {
      limit: 3,
      window: 30 * 1000, // 30 seconds
      windowType: "fixed",
      onReject: (limiter) => {
        // Custom handling
        console.log(`Wait ${limiter.getMsUntilNextWindow()}ms`);
      },
    },
  );
}
```

### Accessing Rate Limiter State

Subscribe to rate limiter state for UI feedback:

```typescript
const rateLimitedFn = useRateLimitedServerFn(
  myServerFunction,
  { type: "api" },
  // Selector for reactive state
  (state) => ({
    executionCount: state.executionCount,
    rejectionCount: state.rejectionCount,
    isExecuting: state.isExecuting,
  })
);

// Use in UI
<button disabled={rateLimitedFn.state.isExecuting}>
  Submit ({rateLimitedFn.state.executionCount}/100)
</button>
```

## Integration Examples

### Login Form with Rate Limiting

See `src/features/auth/components/login-with-rate-limit.tsx` for a complete example of rate limiting authentication attempts.

### Team Creation

```typescript
const rateLimitedCreateTeam = useRateLimitedServerFn(createTeam, { type: "mutation" });

const handleCreate = async (teamData: TeamInput) => {
  const team = await rateLimitedCreateTeam({ data: teamData });
  // Team created successfully
};
```

### Membership Purchase

```typescript
const rateLimitedCheckout = useRateLimitedServerFn(createCheckoutSession, {
  type: "mutation",
  onReject: () => {
    // Custom handling for payment rate limiting
    alert("Too many payment attempts. Please wait before trying again.");
  },
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Choose the Right Type**: Use appropriate rate limit types for different operations
   - `auth` for authentication operations
   - `search` for search/filter operations
   - `mutation` for create/update/delete
   - `api` for general queries

2. **User Feedback**: The default toast notifications work well, but consider custom handling for critical operations

3. **State Management**: Only subscribe to state you need to minimize re-renders

4. **Error Handling**: Rate limit rejections are handled separately from server errors:

   ```typescript
   try {
     await rateLimitedFn(data);
   } catch (error) {
     // This is a server error, not a rate limit
     console.error("Server error:", error);
   }
   ```

5. **Testing**: In development, you can trigger rate limits quickly to test the UI behavior

## Migration Guide

To migrate existing components to use rate limiting:

1. Import the rate limiting hook:

   ```typescript
   import { useRateLimitedServerFn } from "~/lib/pacer/hooks";
   ```

2. Wrap your server function calls:

   ```typescript
   // Before
   const result = await myServerFunction({ data });

   // After
   const rateLimitedFn = useRateLimitedServerFn(myServerFunction, { type: "api" });
   const result = await rateLimitedFn({ data });
   ```

3. Test the rate limiting behavior in development

## Monitoring

Rate limiting events can be monitored through:

1. Browser console in development (when rate limits are hit)
2. Toast notifications shown to users
3. Custom `onReject` handlers for analytics

## Future Enhancements

1. **Persistent State**: Save rate limit state to localStorage to persist across page reloads
2. **Analytics Integration**: Track rate limit events for monitoring
3. **Dynamic Limits**: Adjust limits based on user tier or permissions
4. **Retry Queue**: Automatically retry rejected requests when the window resets

# SendGrid Email Integration

## Overview

This document explains the SendGrid transactional email integration for the Quadball Canada platform, including setup instructions, templates, and usage examples.

## Implementation Status

- **Status**: ✅ Complete (January 2025)
- **Package**: @sendgrid/mail v8.1.0
- **Type**: Transactional emails only
- **Environments**: Mock (development), Real (production)

## Environment Variables

### Required for Production

- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - Your SendGrid API key
- `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` - Verified sender email address
- `SENDGRID_FROM_NAME` - Sender display name (default: "Quadball Canada")

### Example Configuration

```env
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@quadballcanada.com
SENDGRID_FROM_NAME=Quadball Canada
```

## Code Architecture

### Service Pattern

The email integration uses a service pattern with environment-based switching:

```typescript
// src/lib/email/types.ts - Common types and interfaces
interface EmailService {
  send(params: SendEmailParams): Promise<EmailResult>;
}

// src/lib/email/sendgrid-service.ts - Real SendGrid implementation
// src/lib/email/mock-email-service.ts - Mock for development
// src/lib/email/sendgrid.ts - Service factory with convenience methods
```

### Key Files

- **Service Layer**:
  - `src/lib/email/sendgrid.ts` - Main service with convenience methods
  - `src/lib/email/sendgrid-service.ts` - SendGrid SDK implementation
  - `src/lib/email/mock-email-service.ts` - Development mock
  - `src/lib/email/types.ts` - TypeScript types and Zod schemas
  - `src/lib/email/templates/*.ts` - Email templates

- **Integration Points**:
  - `src/features/membership/membership.mutations.ts` - Sends purchase receipts
  - Future: Auth system for password resets
  - Future: Teams for invitations

## Email Templates

### Available Templates

1. **Membership Purchase Receipt** (`membership-receipt.ts`)
   - Sent after successful membership purchase
   - Includes: membership type, price, expiry date
   - Receipt formatting

2. **Welcome Email** (`welcome.ts`)
   - Sent to new users after registration
   - Includes: getting started guide, important links

3. **Password Reset** (`password-reset.ts`)
   - Template ready for future auth integration
   - Includes: reset link, security notice

4. **Team Invitation** (`team-invitation.ts`)
   - Template ready for teams feature
   - Includes: team details, accept/decline links

5. **Event Confirmation** (`event-confirmation.ts`)
   - Template ready for events feature
   - Includes: event details, calendar attachment support

### Template Structure

Each template exports HTML and text versions:

```typescript
export const membershipReceiptTemplate = {
  subject: (data: MembershipReceiptData) => string,
  html: (data: MembershipReceiptData) => string,
  text: (data: MembershipReceiptData) => string,
};
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Email Send

```typescript
import { emailService } from "~/lib/email/sendgrid";

const result = await emailService.send({
  to: ["user@example.com"],
  subject: "Test Email",
  html: "<p>Hello World</p>",
  text: "Hello World",
});
```

### Convenience Methods

```typescript
// Send membership purchase receipt
await sendMembershipPurchaseReceipt({
  to: user.email,
  userName: user.name || user.email,
  membershipType: "Annual Player Membership",
  amount: "$45.00",
  expiryDate: "December 31, 2025",
  receiptNumber: "QC-2025-001234",
});

// Send welcome email
await sendWelcomeEmail({
  to: user.email,
  userName: user.name || "Member",
});
```

## Development Mode

When `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is not set, the mock service is used:

- Emails are logged to console with full details
- No actual emails are sent
- Success is always returned
- Useful for local development and testing

Example console output:

```
[Mock Email Service] Would send email:
From: Quadball Canada <noreply@quadballcanada.com>
To: user@example.com
Subject: Welcome to Quadball Canada!
[HTML and text content displayed]
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```bash
pnpm test src/lib/email/__tests__/
```

### Integration Testing

1. Set `SENDGRID_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
2. Use a test email address
3. Verify email delivery in SendGrid dashboard

## SendGrid Setup

### 1. Create SendGrid Account

1. Sign up at [sendgrid.com](https://sendgrid.com)
2. Complete sender verification
3. Generate API key with "Mail Send" permission

### 2. Verify Sender

1. Go to Settings > Sender Authentication
2. Verify your sending domain or email
3. Complete DNS verification (recommended)

### 3. Configure Environment

```bash
# Add to .env.local or Netlify environment
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-api-key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=verified-email@yourdomain.com
SENDGRID_FROM_NAME=Quadball Canada
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use templates** - Don't hardcode email content
2. **Include text version** - Better deliverability and accessibility
3. **Test in development** - Use mock service to preview emails
4. **Monitor delivery** - Check SendGrid dashboard for bounces/spam
5. **Handle failures gracefully** - Email sending is not guaranteed

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received

1. Check SendGrid dashboard for delivery status
2. Verify sender authentication is complete
3. Check spam folder
4. Review SendGrid activity feed for errors

### API Key Issues

- Ensure API key has "Mail Send" permission
- Check key hasn't been revoked
- Verify environment variable is loaded

### Template Rendering Issues

- Test templates with mock service first
- Validate all required data is provided
- Check for HTML escaping issues

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Templates**: Use SendGrid's template engine
2. **Attachments**: Add calendar invites for events
3. **Bulk Sending**: Newsletter functionality
4. **Analytics**: Track open rates and clicks
5. **Unsubscribe**: Preference center integration

# State Management Recommendations for Solstice

Based on analysis of React's state management best practices and the current codebase.

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ What We're Doing Right

1. **Minimal State**: Components keep only necessary state
2. **Server State Management**: React Query handles server state excellently
3. **Calculated Values**: Derived values are computed during render, not stored
4. **State Proximity**: State lives close to where it's used

### 🔧 Improvements Made

1. **Custom Hooks for Common Patterns**
   - `useAuthForm` - Eliminates duplicate auth form state
   - `useLocalStorage` - Proper external system synchronization
   - `useFocusOnMount` - DOM manipulation with refs
   - `useAsyncState` - Prevents contradictory loading/error states
   - `useProfileFormReducer` - Groups related form state

2. **Context for Cross-Cutting Concerns**
   - `ThemeContext` - Prevents theme prop drilling

## Recommendations

### 1. Adopt State Structure Principles

**Group Related State**

```typescript
// ❌ Bad: Separate states that change together
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
const [error, setError] = useState(null);
const [data, setData] = useState(null);

// ✅ Good: Use a single state or custom hook
const { state, execute } = useAsyncState();
```

**Avoid Contradictions**

```typescript
// ❌ Bad: States that can contradict
const [isSending, setIsSending] = useState(false);
const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);

// ✅ Good: Single state with clear values
const [status, setStatus] = useState<"idle" | "sending" | "sent">("idle");
```

**Avoid Redundant State**

```typescript
// ❌ Bad: Storing calculated values
const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState("");
const [lastName, setLastName] = useState("");
const [fullName, setFullName] = useState(""); // Redundant!

// ✅ Good: Calculate during render
const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
```

### 2. When to Use Each Tool

**useState**: Simple, independent values

- UI state (open/closed, selected tab)
- Form inputs
- Simple counters

**useReducer**: Complex, related state

- Multi-step forms
- Complex UI with many states
- When state updates depend on previous state

**Context**: Cross-cutting concerns

- Theme
- User authentication (already handled by TanStack Router)
- Feature flags
- Localization

**React Query**: Server state

- API data
- Caching
- Background refetching

### 3. Specific Improvements to Make

1. **Profile Form**: Adopt `useProfileFormReducer` to simplify state management
2. **Theme**: Consider using `ThemeContext` if theme is needed in many components
3. **Auth Forms**: Already improved with `useAuthForm`
4. **Async Operations**: Use `useAsyncState` for non-React Query async operations

### 4. State Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Don't sync props to state** (unless you need an "uncontrolled" component)
2. **Don't duplicate server data** in local state
3. **Don't create deeply nested state** objects
4. **Don't store derived state** that can be calculated

### 5. Future Considerations

As the app grows, consider:

- Feature-based contexts for complex features
- State machines (XState) for complex workflows
- Zustand or Valtio for global client state if needed

## Implementation Priority

1. **High**: Fix redundant auth form state (✅ Done)
2. **Medium**: Refactor profile form with reducer
3. **Low**: Add theme context if needed
4. **Future**: Consider state management library as app scales

The codebase is already following most React state management best practices. The main improvements involve consolidating related state and preventing potential contradictions.

# TanStack Start Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for working with TanStack Start server functions, based on lessons learned from migrating away from `@ts-expect-error` suppressions.

## Table of Contents

1. [Server Function Best Practices](#server-function-best-practices)
2. [Type Safety Guidelines](#type-safety-guidelines)
3. [File Organization](#file-organization)
4. [Common Pitfalls](#common-pitfalls)
5. [Migration Guide](#migration-guide)

## Server Function Best Practices

### Always Use Zod Validation

The most important best practice is to use Zod schemas with the `.validator()` method instead of relying on TypeScript type annotations alone.

#### ✅ Good: Zod Validation

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

// 1. Define schema
const createTeamSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1, "Team name is required"),
  slug: z.string().regex(/^[a-z0-9-]+$/, "Invalid slug format"),
  description: z.string().optional(),
});

// 2. Use validator with schema.parse
export const createTeam = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
  .validator(createTeamSchema.parse)
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    // data is properly typed from schema
    // Also validated at runtime!
    return { success: true, team: newTeam };
  });
```

#### ❌ Bad: Type Assertion

```typescript
// AVOID THIS PATTERN
export const createTeam = createServerFn({ method: "POST" }).handler(
  async ({ data }: { data: CreateTeamInput }) => {
    // No runtime validation
    // May need @ts-expect-error
    return { success: true, team: newTeam };
  },
);
```

### Benefits of Zod Validation

1. **Runtime Safety**: Validates inputs at runtime, not just compile time
2. **Better Error Messages**: Zod provides detailed validation errors
3. **Type Inference**: TypeScript types are automatically inferred from schemas
4. **No @ts-expect-error**: Eliminates most type inference issues
5. **Single Source of Truth**: Schema defines both validation and types

## Type Safety Guidelines

### Handling Database jsonb Fields

When working with Drizzle ORM's jsonb fields, create proper type definitions:

#### 1. Create Database Type Definitions

```typescript
// features/events/events.db-types.ts

/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any */

export interface EventMetadata {
  [key: string]: any;
}

export interface EventScheduleItem {
  time: string;
  activity: string;
  location?: string;
}

export interface EventSchedule {
  items?: EventScheduleItem[];
  [key: string]: any;
}
```

#### 2. Override Database Types

```typescript
// features/events/events.types.ts

import type { Event } from "~/db/schema";
import type { EventMetadata, EventSchedule } from "./events.db-types";

export interface EventWithDetails extends Omit<Event, "metadata" | "schedule"> {
  metadata: EventMetadata;
  schedule: EventSchedule;
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Error Handling Pattern

Define typed error responses for consistency:

```typescript
export type OperationResult<T> =
  | { success: true; data: T }
  | { success: false; errors: OperationError[] };

export type OperationError = {
  code: string;
  message: string;
  field?: string;
};
```

## File Organization

Organize server functions by feature with clear separation:

```
src/features/teams/
├── teams.schemas.ts      # All Zod schemas
├── teams.queries.ts      # GET operations (read)
├── teams.mutations.ts    # POST/PUT/DELETE operations (write)
├── teams.types.ts        # TypeScript types and interfaces
└── teams.db-types.ts     # Database-specific type overrides
```

### Example: teams.schemas.ts

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

// Query schemas
export const getTeamSchema = z.object({
  teamId: z.string(),
});

export const listTeamsSchema = z
  .object({
    includeInactive: z.boolean().optional().default(false),
  })
  .optional()
  .default({ includeInactive: false });

// Mutation schemas
export const createTeamSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1),
  slug: z.string().regex(/^[a-z0-9-]+$/),
  // ... other fields
});

export const updateTeamSchema = z.object({
  teamId: z.string(),
  data: createTeamSchema.partial(),
});

// Export inferred types
export type GetTeamInput = z.infer<typeof getTeamSchema>;
export type CreateTeamInput = z.infer<typeof createTeamSchema>;
export type UpdateTeamInput = z.infer<typeof updateTeamSchema>;
```

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Nested Data in Update Operations

When updating with partial data, structure it correctly:

```typescript
// ✅ Correct: Nested data structure
export const updateTeam = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
  .validator(updateTeamSchema.parse)
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    // Access nested data
    const updates = data.data; // data.data contains the actual updates
    const teamId = data.teamId;

    await db.update(teams).set(updates).where(eq(teams.id, teamId));
  });

// Usage
await updateTeam({
  data: {
    teamId: "123",
    data: { name: "New Name" }, // Nested under 'data'
  },
});
```

### 2. Calling Server Functions

Match the call structure to your schema:

```typescript
// If schema expects { data: { ... } }
await myServerFn({ data: { field: "value" } });

// If schema expects direct object
await myServerFn({ field: "value" });

// If no input
await myServerFn();
```

### 3. Import Organization

Keep imports clean and avoid unused imports:

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Import only what you use
import type { EventOperationResult } from "./events.types";

// ❌ Bad: Importing unused types
import type {
  EventOperationResult,
  EventFilters, // unused
  CreateEventInput, // unused
} from "./events.types";
```

## Migration Guide

### Migrating from Type Assertions to Zod

1. **Identify Current Pattern**:

```typescript
// Old pattern with type assertion
.handler(async ({ data }: { data: TeamInput }) => {
```

2. **Create Zod Schema**:

```typescript
const teamInputSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  // ... other fields
});
```

3. **Update Server Function**:

```typescript
// New pattern with validator
.validator(teamInputSchema.parse)
.handler(async ({ data }) => {
```

4. **Update Call Sites**:

```typescript
// Ensure calls match schema structure
await createTeam({ data: teamData });
```

### Handling Existing @ts-expect-error

1. **Investigate the Root Cause**: Don't just remove it
2. **Try Zod Validation First**: Usually solves the issue
3. **Create Type Definitions**: For complex types like jsonb
4. **Document If Necessary**: If truly unavoidable, explain why

### Pre-commit Checks

Ensure your code passes these checks before committing:

- `pnpm lint` - No ESLint errors
- `pnpm check-types` - No TypeScript errors
- `pnpm test` - All tests pass

The pre-commit hook enforces these automatically.

## Summary

- **Always use Zod validation** for server functions
- **Create proper type definitions** for complex database fields
- **Organize code by feature** with clear schema/query/mutation separation
- **Avoid @ts-expect-error** - investigate and fix the root cause
- **Test your validation** to ensure it works as expected

Following these practices will result in more maintainable, type-safe code with better runtime validation and fewer TypeScript issues.

Learn the Basics
This guide will help you learn the basics behind how TanStack Start works, regardless of how you set up your project.

Dependencies
TanStack Start is powered by Vite and TanStack Router.

TanStack Router: A router for building web applications.

Vite: A build tool for bundling your application.

It all "Starts" with the Router
This is the file that will dictate the behavior of TanStack Router used within Start. Here, you can configure everything
from the default preloading functionality to caching staleness.

// src/router.tsx
import { createRouter as createTanStackRouter } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { routeTree } from './routeTree.gen'

export function createRouter() {
const router = createTanStackRouter({
routeTree,
scrollRestoration: true,
})

return router
}

declare module '@tanstack/react-router' {
interface Register {
router: ReturnType<typeof createRouter>
}
}
Notice the scrollRestoration property. This is used to restore the scroll position of the page when navigating between routes.

Route Generation
The routeTree.gen.ts file is generated when you run TanStack Start (via npm run dev or npm run start) for the first time. This file contains the generated route tree and a handful of TS utilities that make TanStack Start fully type-safe.

The Server Entry Point (Optional)
[!NOTE]
The server entry point is optional out of the box. If not provided, TanStack Start will automatically handle the server entry point for you using the below as a default.

This is done via the src/server.ts file:

// src/server.ts
import {
createStartHandler,
defaultStreamHandler,
} from '@tanstack/react-start/server'
import { createRouter } from './router'

export default createStartHandler({
createRouter,
})(defaultStreamHandler)
Whether we are statically generating our app or serving it dynamically, the server.ts file is the entry point for doing all SSR-related work.

It's important that a new router is created for each request. This ensures that any data handled by the router is unique to the request.

The defaultStreamHandler function is used to render our application to a stream, allowing us to take advantage of streaming HTML to the client. (This is the default handler, but you can also use other handlers like defaultRenderHandler, or even build your own)

The Client Entry Point (Optional)
[!NOTE]
The client entry point is optional out of the box. If not provided, TanStack Start will automatically handle the client entry point for you using the below as a default.

Getting our html to the client is only half the battle. Once there, we need to hydrate our client-side JavaScript once the route resolves to the client. We do this by hydrating the root of our application with the StartClient component:

// src/client.tsx
import { StartClient } from '@tanstack/react-start'
import { StrictMode } from 'react'
import { hydrateRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import { createRouter } from './router'

const router = createRouter()

hydrateRoot(
document,
<StrictMode>
<StartClient router={router} />
</StrictMode>,
)
This enables us to kick off client-side routing once the user's initial server request has fulfilled.

The Root of Your Application
Other than the client entry point (which is optional by default), the \_\_root route of your application is the entry point for your application. The code in this file will wrap all other routes in the app, including your home page. It behaves like a pathless layout route for your whole application.

Because it is always rendered, it is the perfect place to construct your application shell and take care of any global logic.

// src/routes/\_\_root.tsx
import {
Outlet,
createRootRoute,
HeadContent,
Scripts,
} from '@tanstack/react-router'
import type { ReactNode } from 'react'

export const Route = createRootRoute({
head: () => ({
meta: [
{
charSet: 'utf-8',
},
{
name: 'viewport',
content: 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1',
},
{
title: 'TanStack Start Starter',
},
],
}),
component: RootComponent,
})

function RootComponent() {
return (
<RootDocument>
<Outlet />
</RootDocument>
)
}

function RootDocument({ children }: Readonly<{ children: ReactNode }>) {
return (

<html>
<head>
<HeadContent />
</head>
<body>
{children}
<Scripts />
</body>
</html>
)
}
This layout may change in the future as we roll out SPA mode, which allows the root route to render the SPA shell without any page-specific content.

Notice the Scripts component. This is used to load all of the client-side JavaScript for the application.

Routes
Routes are an extensive feature of TanStack Router, and are covered thoroughly in the Routing Guide. As a summary:

Routes are defined using the createFileRoute function.

Routes are automatically code-split and lazy-loaded.

Critical data fetching is coordinated from a Route's loader

Much more!

// src/routes/index.tsx
import \* as fs from 'node:fs'
import { createFileRoute, useRouter } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

const filePath = 'count.txt'

async function readCount() {
return parseInt(
await fs.promises.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8').catch(() => '0'),
)
}

const getCount = createServerFn({
method: 'GET',
}).handler(() => {
return readCount()
})

const updateCount = createServerFn({ method: 'POST' })
.validator((d: number) => d)
.handler(async ({ data }) => {
const count = await readCount()
await fs.promises.writeFile(filePath, `${count + data}`)
})

export const Route = createFileRoute('/')({
component: Home,
loader: async () => await getCount(),
})

function Home() {
const router = useRouter()
const state = Route.useLoaderData()

return (
<button
type="button"
onClick={() => {
updateCount({ data: 1 }).then(() => {
router.invalidate()
})
}} >
Add 1 to {state}?
</button>
)
}
Navigation
TanStack Start builds 100% on top of TanStack Router, so all of the navigation features of TanStack Router are available to you. In summary:

Use the Link component to navigate to a new route.

Use the useNavigate hook to navigate imperatively.

Use the useRouter hook anywhere in your application to access the router instance and perform invalidations.

Every router hook that returns state is reactive, meaning it will automatically re-run when the appropriate state changes.

Here's a quick example of how you can use the Link component to navigate to a new route:

import { Link } from '@tanstack/react-router'

function Home() {
return <Link to="/about">About</Link>
}
For more in-depth information on navigation, check out the navigation guide.

Server Functions (RPCs)
You may have noticed the server function we created above using createServerFn. This is one of TanStack's most powerful features, allowing you to create server-side functions that can be called from both the server during SSR and the client!

Here's a quick overview of how server functions work:

Server functions are created using the createServerFn function.

They can be called from both the server during SSR and the client.

They can be used to fetch data from the server, or to perform other server-side actions.

Here's a quick example of how you can use server functions to fetch and return data from the server:

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'
import \* as fs from 'node:fs'
import { z } from 'zod'

const getUserById = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' })
// Always validate data sent to the function, here we use Zod
.validator(z.string())
// The handler function is where you perform the server-side logic
.handler(async ({ data }) => {
return db.query.users.findFirst({ where: eq(users.id, data) })
})

// Somewhere else in your application
const user = await getUserById({ data: '1' })
To learn more about server functions, check out the server functions guide.

Mutations
Server Functions can also be used to perform mutations on the server. This is also done using the same createServerFn function, but with the additional requirement that you invalidate any data on the client that was affected by the mutation.

If you're using TanStack Router only, you can use the router.invalidate() method to invalidate all router data and re-fetch it.

If you're using TanStack Query, you can use the queryClient.invalidateQueries() method to invalidate data, among other more specific methods to target specific queries.

Here's a quick example of how you can use server functions to perform a mutation on the server and invalidate the data on the client:

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'
import { z } from 'zod'
import { dbUpdateUser } from '...'

const UserSchema = z.object({
id: z.string(),
name: z.string(),
})
export type User = z.infer<typeof UserSchema>

export const updateUser = createServerFn({ method: 'POST' })
.validator(UserSchema)
.handler(({ data }) => dbUpdateUser(data))

// Somewhere else in your application
import { useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { useRouter } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { useServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'
import { updateUser, type User } from '...'

export function useUpdateUser() {
const router = useRouter()
const queryClient = useQueryClient()
const \_updateUser = useServerFn(updateUser)

return useCallback(
async (user: User) => {
const result = await \_updateUser({ data: user })

      router.invalidate()
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({
        queryKey: ['users', 'updateUser', user.id],
      })

      return result
    },
    [router, queryClient, _updateUser],

)
}

// Somewhere else in your application
import { useUpdateUser } from '...'

function MyComponent() {
const updateUser = useUpdateUser()
const onClick = useCallback(async () => {
await updateUser({ id: '1', name: 'John' })
console.log('Updated user')
}, [updateUser])

return <button onClick={onClick}>Click Me</button>
}
To learn more about mutations, check out the mutations guide.

Data Loading
Another powerful feature of TanStack Router is data loading. This allows you to fetch data for SSR and preload route data before it is rendered. This is done using the loader function of a route.

Here's a quick overview of how data loading works:

Data loading is done using the loader function of a route.

Data loaders are isomorphic, meaning they are executed on both the server and the client.

For performing server-only logic, call a server function from within the loader.

Similar to TanStack Query, data loaders are cached on the client and are re-used and even re-fetched in the background when the data is stale.

To learn more about data loading, check out the data loading guide.

Server Functions –
Server Functions
What are Server Functions?
Server functions allow you to specify logic that can be invoked almost anywhere (even the client), but run only on the server. In fact, they are not so different from an API Route, but with a few key differences:

They do not have stable public URL.

They can be called from anywhere in your application, including loaders, hooks, components, server routes etc.

However, they are similar to regular API Routes in that:

They have access to the request context, allowing you to read headers, set cookies, and more

They can access sensitive information, such as environment variables, without exposing them to the client

They can be used to perform any kind of server-side logic, such as fetching data from a database, sending emails, or interacting with other services

They can return any value, including primitives, JSON-serializable objects, and even raw Response objects

They can throw errors, including redirects and notFounds, which can be handled automatically by the router

How are server functions different from "React Server Functions"?

TanStack Server Functions are not tied to a specific front-end framework, and can be used with any front-end framework or none at all.

TanStack Server Functions are backed by standard HTTP requests and can be called as often as you like without suffering from serial-execution bottlenecks.

How do they work?
Server functions can be defined anywhere in your application, but must be defined at the top level of a file. They can be called throughout your application, including loaders, hooks, etc. Traditionally, this pattern is known as a Remote Procedure Call (RPC), but due to the isomorphic nature of these functions, we refer to them as server functions.

On the server bundle, server functions logic is left alone. Nothing needs to be done since they are already in the correct place.

On the client, server functions will be removed; they exist only on the server. Any calls to the server function on the client will be replaced with a fetch request to the server to execute the server function, and send the response back to the client.

Server Function Middleware
Server functions can use middleware to share logic, context, common operations, prerequisites, and much more. To learn more about server function middleware, be sure to read about them in the Middleware guide.

Defining Server Functions
We'd like to thank the tRPC team for both the inspiration of TanStack Start's server function design and guidance while implementing it. We love (and recommend) using tRPC for API Routes so much that we insisted on server functions getting the same 1st class treatment and developer experience. Thank you!

Server functions are defined with the createServerFn function, from the @tanstack/react-start package. This function takes an optional options argument for specifying configuration like the HTTP method and response type, and allows you to chain off the result to define things like the body of the server function, input validation, middleware, etc. Here's a simple example:

// getServerTime.ts
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const getServerTime = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
// Wait for 1 second
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
// Return the current time
return new Date().toISOString()
})
Configuration Options
When creating a server function, you can provide configuration options to customize its behavior:

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const getData = createServerFn({
method: 'GET', // HTTP method to use
response: 'data', // Response handling mode
}).handler(async () => {
// Function implementation
})
Available Options
method

Specifies the HTTP method for the server function request:

method?: 'GET' | 'POST'
By default, server functions use GET if not specified.

response

Controls how responses are processed and returned:

response?: 'data' | 'full' | 'raw'
'data' (default): Automatically parses JSON responses and returns just the data

'full': Returns a response object with result data, error information, and context

'raw': Returns the raw Response object directly, enabling streaming responses and custom headers

Where can I call server functions?
From server-side code

From client-side code

From other server functions

[!WARNING]
Server functions cannot be called from API Routes. If you need to share business logic between server functions and API Routes, extract the shared logic into utility functions that can be imported by both.

Accepting Parameters
Server functions accept a single parameter, which can be a variety of types:

Standard JavaScript types

string

number

boolean

null

Array

Object

FormData

ReadableStream (of any of the above)

Promise (of any of the above)

Here's an example of a server function that accepts a simple string parameter:

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const greet = createServerFn({
method: 'GET',
})
.validator((data: string) => data)
.handler(async (ctx) => {
return `Hello, ${ctx.data}!`
})

greet({
data: 'John',
})
Runtime Input Validation / Type Safety
Server functions can be configured to validate their input data at runtime, while adding type safety. This is useful for ensuring the input is of the correct type before executing the server function, and providing more friendly error messages.

This is done with the validator method. It will accept whatever input is passed to the server function. The value (and type) you return from this function will become the input passed to the actual server function handler.

Validators also integrate seamlessly with external validators, if you want to use something like Zod.

Basic Validation
Here's a simple example of a server function that validates the input parameter:

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

type Person = {
name: string
}

export const greet = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' })
.validator((person: unknown): Person => {
if (typeof person !== 'object' || person === null) {
throw new Error('Person must be an object')
}

    if ('name' in person && typeof person.name !== 'string') {
      throw new Error('Person.name must be a string')
    }

    return person as Person

})
.handler(async ({ data }) => {
return `Hello, ${data.name}!`
})
Using a Validation Library
Validation libraries like Zod can be used like so:

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

import { z } from 'zod'

const Person = z.object({
name: z.string(),
})

export const greet = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' })
.validator((person: unknown) => {
return Person.parse(person)
})
.handler(async (ctx) => {
return `Hello, ${ctx.data.name}!`
})

greet({
data: {
name: 'John',
},
})
Type Safety
Since server-functions cross the network boundary, it's important to ensure the data being passed to them is not only the right type, but also validated at runtime. This is especially important when dealing with user input, as it can be unpredictable. To ensure developers validate their I/O data, types are reliant on validation. The return type of the validator function will be the input to the server function's handler.

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

type Person = {
name: string
}

export const greet = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' })
.validator((person: unknown): Person => {
if (typeof person !== 'object' || person === null) {
throw new Error('Person must be an object')
}

    if ('name' in person && typeof person.name !== 'string') {
      throw new Error('Person.name must be a string')
    }

    return person as Person

})
.handler(
async ({
data, // Person
}) => {
return `Hello, ${data.name}!`
},
)

function test() {
greet({ data: { name: 'John' } }) // OK
greet({ data: { name: 123 } }) // Error: Argument of type '{ name: number; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Person'.
}
Inference
Server functions infer their input, and output types based on the input to the validator, and return value of handler functions, respectively. In fact, the validator you define can even have its own separate input/output types, which can be useful if your validator performs transformations on the input data.

To illustrate this, let's take a look at an example using the zod validation library:

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'
import { z } from 'zod'

const transactionSchema = z.object({
amount: z.string().transform((val) => parseInt(val, 10)),
})

const createTransaction = createServerFn()
.validator(transactionSchema)
.handler(({ data }) => {
return data.amount // Returns a number
})

createTransaction({
data: {
amount: '123', // Accepts a string
},
})
Non-Validated Inference
While we highly recommend using a validation library to validate your network I/O data, you may, for whatever reason not want to validate your data, but still have type safety. To do this, provide type information to the server function using an identity function as the validator, that types the input, and or output to the correct types:

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

type Person = {
name: string
}

export const greet = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' })
.validator((d: Person) => d)
.handler(async (ctx) => {
return `Hello, ${ctx.data.name}!`
})

greet({
data: {
name: 'John',
},
})
JSON Parameters
Server functions can accept JSON-serializable objects as parameters. This is useful for passing complex data structures to the server:

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

type Person = {
name: string
age: number
}

export const greet = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' })
.validator((data: Person) => data)
.handler(async ({ data }) => {
return `Hello, ${data.name}! You are ${data.age} years old.`
})

greet({
data: {
name: 'John',
age: 34,
},
})
FormData Parameters
Server functions can accept FormData objects as parameters

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const greetUser = createServerFn({ method: 'POST' })
.validator((data) => {
if (!(data instanceof FormData)) {
throw new Error('Invalid form data')
}
const name = data.get('name')
const age = data.get('age')

    if (!name || !age) {
      throw new Error('Name and age are required')
    }

    return {
      name: name.toString(),
      age: parseInt(age.toString(), 10),
    }

})
.handler(async ({ data: { name, age } }) => {
return `Hello, ${name}! You are ${age} years old.`
})

// Usage
function Test() {
return (

<form
onSubmit={async (event) => {
event.preventDefault()
const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget)
const response = await greetUser({ data: formData })
console.log(response)
}} >
<input name="name" />
<input name="age" />
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
)
}
Server Function Context
In addition to the single parameter that server functions accept, you can also access server request context from within any server function using utilities from @tanstack/react-start/server. Under the hood, we use Unjs's h3 package to perform cross-platform HTTP requests.

There are many context functions available to you for things like:

Accessing the request context

Accessing/setting headers

Accessing/setting sessions/cookies

Setting response status codes and status messages

Dealing with multi-part form data

Reading/Setting custom server context properties

For a full list of available context functions, see all of the available h3 Methods or inspect the @tanstack/start-server-core Source Code.

For starters, here are a few examples:

Accessing the Request Context
Let's use the getWebRequest function to access the request itself from within a server function:

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'
import { getWebRequest } from '@tanstack/react-start/server'

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(
async () => {
const request = getWebRequest()

    console.log(request.method) // GET

    console.log(request.headers.get('User-Agent')) // Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3

},
)
Accessing Headers
Use the getHeaders function to access all headers from within a server function:

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'
import { getHeaders } from '@tanstack/react-start/server'

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(
async () => {
console.log(getHeaders())
// {
// "accept": "_/_",
// "accept-encoding": "gzip, deflate, br",
// "accept-language": "en-US,en;q=0.9",
// "connection": "keep-alive",
// "host": "localhost:3000",
// ...
// }
},
)
You can also access individual headers using the getHeader function:

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'
import { getHeader } from '@tanstack/react-start/server'

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(
async () => {
console.log(getHeader('User-Agent')) // Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3
},
)
Returning Values
Server functions can return a few different types of values:

Primitives

JSON-serializable objects

redirect errors (can also be thrown)

notFound errors (can also be thrown)

Raw Response objects

Returning Primitives and JSON
To return any primitive or JSON-serializable object, simply return the value from the server function:

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(
async () => {
return new Date().toISOString()
},
)

export const getServerData = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(
async () => {
return {
message: 'Hello, World!',
}
},
)
By default, server functions assume that any non-Response object returned is either a primitive or JSON-serializable object.

Responding with Custom Headers
To respond with custom headers, you can use the setHeader function:

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'
import { setHeader } from '@tanstack/react-start/server'

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(
async () => {
setHeader('X-Custom-Header', 'value')
return new Date().toISOString()
},
)
Responding with Custom Status Codes
To respond with a custom status code, you can use the setResponseStatus function:

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'
import { setResponseStatus } from '@tanstack/react-start/server'

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(
async () => {
setResponseStatus(201)
return new Date().toISOString()
},
)
Returning Raw Response objects
To return a raw Response object, return a Response object from the server function and set response: 'raw':

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({
method: 'GET',
response: 'raw',
}).handler(async () => {
// Read a file from s3
return fetch('https://example.com/time.txt')
})
The response: 'raw' option also allows for streaming responses among other things:

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const streamEvents = createServerFn({
method: 'GET',
response: 'raw',
}).handler(async ({ signal }) => {
// Create a ReadableStream to send chunks of data
const stream = new ReadableStream({
async start(controller) {
// Send initial response immediately
controller.enqueue(new TextEncoder().encode('Connection established\n'))

      let count = 0
      const interval = setInterval(() => {
        // Check if the client disconnected
        if (signal.aborted) {
          clearInterval(interval)
          controller.close()
          return
        }

        // Send a data chunk
        controller.enqueue(
          new TextEncoder().encode(
            `Event ${++count}: ${new Date().toISOString()}\n`,
          ),
        )

        // End after 10 events
        if (count >= 10) {
          clearInterval(interval)
          controller.close()
        }
      }, 1000)

      // Ensure we clean up if the request is aborted
      signal.addEventListener('abort', () => {
        clearInterval(interval)
        controller.close()
      })
    },

})

// Return a streaming response
return new Response(stream, {
headers: {
'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
'Cache-Control': 'no-cache',
Connection: 'keep-alive',
},
})
})
The response: 'raw' option is particularly useful for:

Streaming APIs where data is sent incrementally

Server-sent events

Long-polling responses

Custom content types and binary data

Throwing Errors
Aside from special redirect and notFound errors, server functions can throw any custom error. These errors will be serialized and sent to the client as a JSON response along with a 500 status code.

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const doStuff = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(async () => {
throw new Error('Something went wrong!')
})

// Usage
function Test() {
try {
await doStuff()
} catch (error) {
console.error(error)
// {
// message: "Something went wrong!",
// stack: "Error: Something went wrong!\n at doStuff (file:///path/to/file.ts:3:3)"
// }
}
}
Cancellation
On the client, server function calls can be cancelled via an AbortSignal.
On the server, an AbortSignal will notify if the request closed before execution finished.

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const abortableServerFn = createServerFn().handler(
async ({ signal }) => {
return new Promise<string>((resolve, reject) => {
if (signal.aborted) {
return reject(new Error('Aborted before start'))
}
const timerId = setTimeout(() => {
console.log('server function finished')
resolve('server function result')
}, 1000)
const onAbort = () => {
clearTimeout(timerId)
console.log('server function aborted')
reject(new Error('Aborted'))
}
signal.addEventListener('abort', onAbort, { once: true })
})
},
)

// Usage
function Test() {
const controller = new AbortController()
const serverFnPromise = abortableServerFn({
signal: controller.signal,
})
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500))
controller.abort()
try {
const serverFnResult = await serverFnPromise
console.log(serverFnResult) // should never get here
} catch (error) {
console.error(error) // "signal is aborted without reason"
}
}
Calling server functions from within route lifecycles
Server functions can be called normally from route loaders, beforeLoads, or any other router-controlled APIs. These APIs are equipped to handle errors, redirects, and notFounds thrown by server functions automatically.

import { getServerTime } from './getServerTime'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/time')({
loader: async () => {
const time = await getServerTime()

    return {
      time,
    }

},
})
Calling server functions from hooks and components
Server functions can throw redirects or notFounds and while not required, it is recommended to catch these errors and handle them appropriately. To make this easier, the @tanstack/react-start package exports a useServerFn hook that can be used to bind server functions to components and hooks:

import { useServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { getServerTime } from './getServerTime'

export function Time() {
const getTime = useServerFn(getServerTime)

const timeQuery = useQuery({
queryKey: 'time',
queryFn: () => getTime(),
})
}
Calling server functions anywhere else
When using server functions, be aware that redirects and notFounds they throw will only be handled automatically when called from:

Route lifecycles

Components using the useServerFn hook

For other usage locations, you'll need to handle these cases manually.

Redirects
Server functions can throw a redirect error to redirect the user to a different URL. This is useful for handling authentication, authorization, or other scenarios where you need to redirect the user to a different page.

During SSR, redirects are handled by sending a 302 response to the client with the new location

On the client, redirects are handled by the router automatically from within a route lifecycle or a component that uses the useServerFn hook. If you call a server function from anywhere else, redirects will not be handled automatically.

To throw a redirect, you can use the redirect function exported from the @tanstack/react-router package:

import { redirect } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const doStuff = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(async () => {
// Redirect the user to the home page
throw redirect({
to: '/',
})
})
Redirects can utilize all of the same options as router.navigate, useNavigate() and <Link> components. So feel free to also pass:

Path Params

Search Params

Hash

Redirects can also set the status code of the response by passing a status option:

import { redirect } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const doStuff = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(async () => {
// Redirect the user to the home page with a 301 status code
throw redirect({
to: '/',
status: 301,
})
})
You can also redirect to an external target using href:

import { redirect } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const auth = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(async () => {
// Redirect the user to the auth provider
throw redirect({
href: 'https://authprovider.com/login',
})
})
⚠️ Do not use @tanstack/react-start/server's sendRedirect function to send soft redirects from within server functions. This will send the redirect using the Location header and will force a full page hard navigation on the client.

Redirect Headers
You can also set custom headers on a redirect by passing a headers option:

import { redirect } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const doStuff = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(async () => {
// Redirect the user to the home page with a custom header
throw redirect({
to: '/',
headers: {
'X-Custom-Header': 'value',
},
})
})
Not Found
While calling a server function from a loader or beforeLoad route lifecycle, a special notFound error can be thrown to indicate to the router that the requested resource was not found. This is more useful than a simple 404 status code, as it allows you to render a custom 404 page, or handle the error in a custom way. If notFound is thrown from a server function used outside of a route lifecycle, it will not be handled automatically.

To throw a notFound, you can use the notFound function exported from the @tanstack/react-router package:

import { notFound } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

const getStuff = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(async () => {
// Randomly return a not found error
if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
throw notFound()
}

// Or return some stuff
return {
stuff: 'stuff',
}
})

export const Route = createFileRoute('/stuff')({
loader: async () => {
const stuff = await getStuff()

    return {
      stuff,
    }

},
})
Not found errors are a core feature of TanStack Router,

Handling Errors
If a server function throws a (non-redirect/non-notFound) error, it will be serialized and sent to the client as a JSON response along with a 500 status code. This is useful for debugging, but you may want to handle these errors in a more user-friendly way. You can do this by catching the error and handling it in your route lifecycle, component, or hook as you normally would.

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const doStuff = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(async () => {
undefined.foo()
})

export const Route = createFileRoute('/stuff')({
loader: async () => {
try {
await doStuff()
} catch (error) {
// Handle the error:
// error === {
// message: "Cannot read property 'foo' of undefined",
// stack: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'foo' of undefined\n at doStuff (file:///path/to/file.ts:3:3)"
}
},
})
No-JS Server Functions
Without JavaScript enabled, there's only one way to execute server functions: by submitting a form.

This is done by adding a form element to the page
with the HTML attribute action.

Notice that we mentioned the HTML attribute action. This attribute only accepts a string in HTML, just like all
other attributes.

While React 19
added support for passing a function to action,
it's
a React-specific feature and not part of the HTML standard.

The action attribute tells the browser where to send the form data when the form is submitted. In this case, we want
to send the form data to the server function.

To do this, we can utilize the url property of the server function:

const yourFn = createServerFn({ method: 'POST' })
.validator((formData) => {
if (!(formData instanceof FormData)) {
throw new Error('Invalid form data')
}

    const name = formData.get('name')

    if (!name) {
      throw new Error('Name is required')
    }

    return name

})
.handler(async ({ data: name }) => {
console.log(name) // 'John'
})

console.info(yourFn.url)
And pass this to the action attribute of the form:

function Component() {
return (

<form action={yourFn.url} method="POST">
<input name="name" defaultValue="John" />
<button type="submit">Click me!</button>
</form>
)
}
When the form is submitted, the server function will be executed.

No-JS Server Function Arguments
To pass arguments to a server function when submitting a form, you can use the input element with the name attribute
to attach the argument to the FormData passed to your
server function:

const yourFn = createServerFn({ method: 'POST' })
.validator((formData) => {
if (!(formData instanceof FormData)) {
throw new Error('Invalid form data')
}

    const age = formData.get('age')

    if (!age) {
      throw new Error('age is required')
    }

    return age.toString()

})
.handler(async ({ data: formData }) => {
// `age` will be '123'
const age = formData.get('age')
// ...
})

function Component() {
return (
// We need to tell the server that our data type is `multipart/form-data` by setting the `encType` attribute on the form.

<form action={yourFn.url} method="POST" encType="multipart/form-data">
<input name="age" defaultValue="34" />
<button type="submit">Click me!</button>
</form>
)
}
When the form is submitted, the server function will be executed with the form's data as an argument.

No-JS Server Function Return Value
Regardless of whether JavaScript is enabled, the server function will return a response to the HTTP request made from
the client.

When JavaScript is enabled, this response can be accessed as the return value of the server function in the client's
JavaScript code.

const yourFn = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
return 'Hello, world!'
})

// `.then` is not available when JavaScript is disabled
yourFn().then(console.log)
However, when JavaScript is disabled, there is no way to access the return value of the server function in the client's
JavaScript code.

Instead, the server function can provide a response to the client, telling the browser to navigate in a certain way.

When combined with a loader from TanStack Router, we're able to provide an experience similar to a single-page application, even when
JavaScript is disabled;
all by telling the browser to reload the current page with new data piped through the loader:

import \* as fs from 'fs'
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

const filePath = 'count.txt'

async function readCount() {
return parseInt(
await fs.promises.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8').catch(() => '0'),
)
}

const getCount = createServerFn({
method: 'GET',
}).handler(() => {
return readCount()
})

const updateCount = createServerFn({ method: 'POST' })
.validator((formData) => {
if (!(formData instanceof FormData)) {
throw new Error('Invalid form data')
}

    const addBy = formData.get('addBy')

    if (!addBy) {
      throw new Error('addBy is required')
    }

    return parseInt(addBy.toString())

})
.handler(async ({ data: addByAmount }) => {
const count = await readCount()
await fs.promises.writeFile(filePath, `${count + addByAmount}`)
// Reload the page to trigger the loader again
return new Response('ok', { status: 301, headers: { Location: '/' } })
})

export const Route = createFileRoute('/')({
component: Home,
loader: async () => await getCount(),
})

function Home() {
const state = Route.useLoaderData()

return (

<div>
<form
        action={updateCount.url}
        method="POST"
        encType="multipart/form-data"
      >
<input type="number" name="addBy" defaultValue="1" />
<button type="submit">Add</button>
</form>
<pre>{state}</pre>
</div>
)
}
Static Server Functions
When using prerendering/static-generation, server functions can also be "static", which enables their results to be cached at build time and served as static assets.

Learn all about this pattern on the Static Server Functions page.

How are server functions compiled?
Under the hood, server functions are extracted out of the client bundle and into a separate server bundle. On the server, they are executed as-is, and the result is sent back to the client. On the client, server functions proxy the request to the server, which executes the function and sends the result back to the client, all via fetch.

The process looks like this:

When createServerFn is found in a file, the inner function is checked for a use server directive

If the use server directive is missing, it is added to the top of the function

On the client, the inner function is extracted out of the client bundle and into a separate server bundle

The client-side server function is replaced with a proxy function that sends a request to the server to execute the function that was extracted

On the server, the server function is not extracted, and is executed as-is

After extraction occurs, each bundle applies a dead-code elimination process to remove any unused code from each bundle.

Static Server Functions –
Static Server Functions
What are Static Server Functions?
Static server functions are server functions that are executed at build time and cached as static assets when using prerendering/static-generation. They can be set to "static" mode by passing the type: 'static' option to createServerFn:

const myServerFn = createServerFn({ type: 'static' }).handler(async () => {
return 'Hello, world!'
})
This pattern goes as follows:

Build-time

During build-time prerendering, a server function with type: 'static' is executed

The result is cached with your build output as a static JSON file under a derived key (function ID + params/payload hash)

The result is returned as normal during prerendering/static-generation and used to prerender the page

Runtime

Initially, the prerendered page's html is served and the server function data is embedded in the html

When the client mounts, the embedded server function data is hydrated

For future client-side invocations, the server function is replaced with a fetch call to the static JSON file

Customizing the Server Functions Static Cache
By default, the static server function cache implementation stores and retrieves static data in the build output directory via node's fs module and likewise fetches the data at runtime using a fetch call to the same static file.

This interface can be customized by importing and calling the createServerFnStaticCache function to create a custom cache implementation and then calling setServerFnStaticCache to set it:

import {
createServerFnStaticCache,
setServerFnStaticCache,
} from '@tanstack/react-start/client'

const myCustomStaticCache = createServerFnStaticCache({
setItem: async (ctx, data) => {
// Store the static data in your custom cache
},
getItem: async (ctx) => {
// Retrieve the static data from your custom cache
},
fetchItem: async (ctx) => {
// During runtime, fetch the static data from your custom cache
},
})

setServerFnStaticCache(myCustomStaticCache)

Middleware –
Middleware
What is Server Function Middleware?
Middleware allows you to customize the behavior of server functions created with createServerFn with things like shared validation, context, and much more. Middleware can even depend on other middleware to create a chain of operations that are executed hierarchically and in order.

What kinds of things can I do with Middleware in my Server Functions?
Authentication: Verify a user's identity before executing a server function.

Authorization: Check if a user has the necessary permissions to execute a server function.

Logging: Log requests, responses, and errors.

Observability: Collect metrics, traces, and logs.

Provide Context: Attach data to the request object for use in other middleware or server functions.

Error Handling: Handle errors in a consistent way.

And many more! The possibilities are up to you!

Defining Middleware for Server Functions
Middleware is defined using the createMiddleware function. This function returns a Middleware object that can be used to continue customizing the middleware with methods like middleware, validator, server, and client.

import { createMiddleware } from '@tanstack/react-start'

const loggingMiddleware = createMiddleware({ type: 'function' }).server(
async ({ next, data }) => {
console.log('Request received:', data)
const result = await next()
console.log('Response processed:', result)
return result
},
)
Using Middleware in Your Server Functions
Once you've defined your middleware, you can use it in combination with the createServerFn function to customize the behavior of your server functions.

import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'
import { loggingMiddleware } from './middleware'

const fn = createServerFn()
.middleware([loggingMiddleware])
.handler(async () => {
// ...
})
Middleware Methods
Several methods are available to customize the middleware. If you are (hopefully) using TypeScript, the order of these methods is enforced by the type system to ensure maximum inference and type safety.

middleware: Add a middleware to the chain.

validator: Modify the data object before it is passed to this middleware and any nested middleware.

server: Define server-side logic that the middleware will execute before any nested middleware and ultimately a server function, and also provide the result to the next middleware.

client: Define client-side logic that the middleware will execute before any nested middleware and ultimately the client-side RPC function (or the server-side function), and also provide the result to the next middleware.

The middleware method
The middleware method is used to dependency middleware to the chain that will executed before the current middleware. Just call the middleware method with an array of middleware objects.

import { createMiddleware } from '@tanstack/react-start'

const loggingMiddleware = createMiddleware({ type: 'function' }).middleware([
authMiddleware,
loggingMiddleware,
])
Type-safe context and payload validation are also inherited from parent middlewares!

The validator method
The validator method is used to modify the data object before it is passed to this middleware, nested middleware, and ultimately the server function. This method should receive a function that takes the data object and returns a validated (and optionally modified) data object. It's common to use a validation library like zod to do this. Here is an example:

import { createMiddleware } from '@tanstack/react-start'
import { zodValidator } from '@tanstack/zod-adapter'
import { z } from 'zod'

const mySchema = z.object({
workspaceId: z.string(),
})

const workspaceMiddleware = createMiddleware({ type: 'function' })
.validator(zodValidator(mySchema))
.server(({ next, data }) => {
console.log('Workspace ID:', data.workspaceId)
return next()
})
The server method
The server method is used to define server-side logic that the middleware will execute both before and after any nested middleware and ultimately a server function. This method receives an object with the following properties:

next: A function that, when called, will execute the next middleware in the chain.

data: The data object that was passed to the server function.

context: An object that stores data from parent middleware. It can be extended with additional data that will be passed to child middleware.

Returning the required result from next
The next function is used to execute the next middleware in the chain. You must await and return (or return directly) the result of the next function provided to you for the chain to continue executing.

import { createMiddleware } from '@tanstack/react-start'

const loggingMiddleware = createMiddleware({ type: 'function' }).server(
async ({ next }) => {
console.log('Request received')
const result = await next()
console.log('Response processed')
return result
},
)
Providing context to the next middleware via next
The next function can be optionally called with an object that has a context property with an object value. Whatever properties you pass to this context value will be merged into the parent context and provided to the next middleware.

import { createMiddleware } from '@tanstack/react-start'

const awesomeMiddleware = createMiddleware({ type: 'function' }).server(
({ next }) => {
return next({
context: {
isAwesome: Math.random() > 0.5,
},
})
},
)

const loggingMiddleware = createMiddleware({ type: 'function' })
.middleware([awesomeMiddleware])
.server(async ({ next, context }) => {
console.log('Is awesome?', context.isAwesome)
return next()
})
Client-Side Logic
Despite server functions being mostly server-side bound operations, there is still plenty of client-side logic surrounding the outgoing RPC request from the client. This means that we can also define client-side logic in middleware that will execute on the client side around any nested middleware and ultimately the RPC function and its response to the client.

Client-side Payload Validation
By default, middleware validation is only performed on the server to keep the client bundle size small. However, you may also choose to validate data on the client side by passing the validateClient: true option to the createMiddleware function. This will cause the data to be validated on the client side before being sent to the server, potentially saving a round trip.

Why can't I pass a different validation schema for the client?

The client-side validation schema is derived from the server-side schema. This is because the client-side validation schema is used to validate the data before it is sent to the server. If the client-side schema were different from the server-side schema, the server would receive data that it did not expect, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

import { createMiddleware } from '@tanstack/react-start'
import { zodValidator } from '@tanstack/zod-adapter'
import { z } from 'zod'

const workspaceMiddleware = createMiddleware({ validateClient: true })
.validator(zodValidator(mySchema))
.server(({ next, data }) => {
console.log('Workspace ID:', data.workspaceId)
return next()
})
The client method
Client middleware logic is defined using the client method on a Middleware object. This method is used to define client-side logic that the middleware will execute both before and after any nested middleware and ultimately the client-side RPC function (or the server-side function if you're doing SSR or calling this function from another server function).

Client-side middleware logic shares much of the same API as logic created with the server method, but it is executed on the client side. This includes:

Requiring the next function to be called to continue the chain.

The ability to provide context to the next client middleware via the next function.

The ability to modify the data object before it is passed to the next client middleware.

Similar to the server function, it also receives an object with the following properties:

next: A function that, when called, will execute the next client middleware in the chain.

data: The data object that was passed to the client function.

context: An object that stores data from parent middleware. It can be extended with additional data that will be passed to child middleware.

const loggingMiddleware = createMiddleware({ type: 'function' }).client(
async ({ next }) => {
console.log('Request sent')
const result = await next()
console.log('Response received')
return result
},
)
Sending client context to the server
Client context is NOT sent to the server by default since this could end up unintentionally sending large payloads to the server. If you need to send client context to the server, you must call the next function with a sendContext property and object to transmit any data to the server. Any properties passed to sendContext will be merged, serialized and sent to the server along with the data and will be available on the normal context object of any nested server middleware.

const requestLogger = createMiddleware({ type: 'function' })
.client(async ({ next, context }) => {
return next({
sendContext: {
// Send the workspace ID to the server
workspaceId: context.workspaceId,
},
})
})
.server(async ({ next, data, context }) => {
// Woah! We have the workspace ID from the client!
console.log('Workspace ID:', context.workspaceId)
return next()
})
Client-Sent Context Security
You may have noticed that in the example above that while client-sent context is type-safe, it is is not required to be validated at runtime. If you pass dynamic user-generated data via context, that could pose a security concern, so if you are sending dynamic data from the client to the server via context, you should validate it in the server-side middleware before using it. Here's an example:

import { zodValidator } from '@tanstack/zod-adapter'
import { z } from 'zod'

const requestLogger = createMiddleware({ type: 'function' })
.client(async ({ next, context }) => {
return next({
sendContext: {
workspaceId: context.workspaceId,
},
})
})
.server(async ({ next, data, context }) => {
// Validate the workspace ID before using it
const workspaceId = zodValidator(z.number()).parse(context.workspaceId)
console.log('Workspace ID:', workspaceId)
return next()
})
Sending server context to the client
Similar to sending client context to the server, you can also send server context to the client by calling the next function with a sendContext property and object to transmit any data to the client. Any properties passed to sendContext will be merged, serialized and sent to the client along with the response and will be available on the normal context object of any nested client middleware. The returned object of calling next in client contains the context sent from server to the client and is type-safe. Middleware is able to infer the context sent from the server to the client from previous middleware chained from the middleware function.

[!WARNING]
The return type of next in client can only be inferred from middleware known in the current middleware chain. Therefore the most accurate return type of next is in middleware at the end of the middleware chain

const serverTimer = createMiddleware({ type: 'function' }).server(
async ({ next }) => {
return next({
sendContext: {
// Send the current time to the client
timeFromServer: new Date(),
},
})
},
)

const requestLogger = createMiddleware({ type: 'function' })
.middleware([serverTimer])
.client(async ({ next }) => {
const result = await next()
// Woah! We have the time from the server!
console.log('Time from the server:', result.context.timeFromServer)

    return result

})
Reading/Modifying the Server Response
Middleware that uses the server method executes in the same context as server functions, so you can follow the exact same Server Function Context Utilities to read and modify anything about the request headers, status codes, etc.

Modifying the Client Request
Middleware that uses the client method executes in a completely different client-side context than server functions, so you can't use the same utilities to read and modify the request. However, you can still modify the request returning additional properties when calling the next function. Currently supported properties are:

headers: An object containing headers to be added to the request.

Here's an example of adding an Authorization header any request using this middleware:

import { getToken } from 'my-auth-library'

const authMiddleware = createMiddleware({ type: 'function' }).client(
async ({ next }) => {
return next({
headers: {
Authorization: `Bearer ${getToken()}`,
},
})
},
)
Using Middleware
Middleware can be used in two different ways:

Global Middleware: Middleware that should be executed for every request.

Server Function Middleware: Middleware that should be executed for a specific server function.

Global Middleware
Global middleware runs automatically for every server function in your application. This is useful for functionality like authentication, logging, and monitoring that should apply to all requests.

To use global middleware, create a global-middleware.ts file in your project (typically at app/global-middleware.ts). This file runs in both client and server environments and is where you register global middleware.

Here's how to register global middleware:

// app/global-middleware.ts
import { registerGlobalMiddleware } from '@tanstack/react-start'
import { authMiddleware } from './middleware'

registerGlobalMiddleware({
middleware: [authMiddleware],
})
Global Middleware Type Safety
Global middleware types are inherently detached from server functions themselves. This means that if a global middleware supplies additional context to server functions or other server function specific middleware, the types will not be automatically passed through to the server function or other server function specific middleware.

// app/global-middleware.ts
registerGlobalMiddleware({
middleware: [authMiddleware],
})
// authMiddleware.ts
const authMiddleware = createMiddleware({ type: 'function' }).server(
({ next, context }) => {
console.log(context.user) // <-- This will not be typed!
// ...
},
)
To solve this, add the global middleware you are trying to reference to the server function's middleware array. The global middleware will be deduped to a single entry (the global instance), and your server function will receive the correct types.

Here's an example of how this works:

import { authMiddleware } from './authMiddleware'

const fn = createServerFn()
.middleware([authMiddleware])
.handler(async ({ context }) => {
console.log(context.user)
// ...
})
Middleware Execution Order
Middleware is executed dependency-first, starting with global middleware, followed by server function middleware. The following example will log the following in this order:

globalMiddleware1

globalMiddleware2

a

b

c

d

const globalMiddleware1 = createMiddleware({ type: 'function' }).server(
async ({ next }) => {
console.log('globalMiddleware1')
return next()
},
)

const globalMiddleware2 = createMiddleware({ type: 'function' }).server(
async ({ next }) => {
console.log('globalMiddleware2')
return next()
},
)

registerGlobalMiddleware({
middleware: [globalMiddleware1, globalMiddleware2],
})

const a = createMiddleware({ type: 'function' }).server(async ({ next }) => {
console.log('a')
return next()
})

const b = createMiddleware({ type: 'function' })
.middleware([a])
.server(async ({ next }) => {
console.log('b')
return next()
})

const c = createMiddleware({ type: 'function' })
.middleware()
.server(async ({ next }) => {
console.log('c')
return next()
})

const d = createMiddleware({ type: 'function' })
.middleware([b, c])
.server(async () => {
console.log('d')
})

const fn = createServerFn()
.middleware([d])
.server(async () => {
console.log('fn')
})
Environment Tree Shaking
Middleware functionality is tree-shaken based on the environment for each bundle produced.

On the server, nothing is tree-shaken, so all code used in middleware will be included in the server bundle.

On the client, all server-specific code is removed from the client bundle. This means any code used in the server method is always removed from the client bundle. If validateClient is set to true, the client-side validation code will be included in the client bundle, otherwise data validation code will also be removed.

Server Routes –
Server Routes
Server routes are a powerful feature of TanStack Start that allow you to create server-side endpoints in your application and are useful for handling raw HTTP requests, form submissions, user authentication, and much more.

Server routes can be defined in your ./src/routes directory of your project right alongside your TanStack Router routes and are automatically handled by the TanStack Start server.

Here's what a simple server route looks like:

// routes/hello.ts

export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
GET: async ({ request }) => {
return new Response('Hello, World!')
},
})
Server Routes and App Routes
Because server routes can be defined in the same directory as your app routes, you can even use the same file for both!

// routes/hello.tsx

export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
POST: async ({ request }) => {
const body = await request.json()
return new Response(JSON.stringify({ message: `Hello, ${body.name}!` }))
},
})

export const Route = createFileRoute('/hello')({
component: HelloComponent,
})

function HelloComponent() {
const [reply, setReply] = useState('')

return (

<div>
<button
onClick={() => {
fetch('/hello', {

headers: {
'Content-Type': 'application/json',
},
body: JSON.stringify({ name: 'Tanner' }),
})
.then((res) => res.json())
.then((data) => setReply(data.message))
}} >
Say Hello
</button>
</div>
)
}
File Route Conventions
Server routes in TanStack Start, follow the same file-based routing conventions as TanStack Router. This means that each file in your routes directory with a ServerRoute export will be treated as an API route. Here are a few examples:

/routes/users.ts will create an API route at /users

/routes/users.index.ts will also create an API route at /users (but will error if duplicate methods are defined)

/routes/users/$id.ts will create an API route at /users/$id

/routes/users/$id/posts.ts will create an API route at /users/$id/posts

/routes/users.$id.posts.ts will create an API route at /users/$id/posts

/routes/api/file/$.ts will create an API route at /api/file/$

/routes/my-script[.]js.ts will create an API route at /my-script.js

Unique Route Paths
Each route can only have a single handler file associated with it. So, if you have a file named routes/users.ts which'd equal the request path of /users, you cannot have other files that'd also resolve to the same route. For example, the following files would all resolve to the same route and would error:

/routes/users.index.ts

/routes/users.ts

/routes/users/index.ts

Escaped Matching
Just as with normal routes, server routes can match on escaped characters. For example, a file named routes/users[.]json.ts will create an API route at /users.json.

Pathless Layout Routes and Break-out Routes
Because of the unified routing system, pathless layout routes and break-out routes are supported for similar functionality around server route middleware.

Pathless layout routes can be used to add middleware to a group of routes

Break-out routes can be used to "break out" of parent middleware

Nested Directories vs File-names
In the examples above, you may have noticed that the file naming conventions are flexible and allow you to mix and match directories and file names. This is intentional and allows you to organize your Server routes in a way that makes sense for your application. You can read more about this in the TanStack Router File-based Routing Guide.

Handling Server Route Requests
Server route requests are handled by Start's createStartHandler in your server.ts entry file.

// server.ts
import {
createStartHandler,
defaultStreamHandler,
} from '@tanstack/react-start/server'
import { createRouter } from './router'

export default createStartHandler({
createRouter,
})(defaultStreamHandler)
The start handler is responsible for matching an incoming request to a server route and executing the appropriate middleware and handler.

Remember, if you need to customize the server handler, you can do so by creating a custom handler and then passing the event to the start handler:

// server.ts
import { createStartHandler } from '@tanstack/react-start/server'

export default defineHandler((event) => {
const startHandler = createStartHandler({
createRouter,
})(defaultStreamHandler)

return startHandler(event)
})
Defining a Server Route
Server routes are created by exporting a ServerRoute from a route file. The ServerRoute export should be created by calling the createServerFileRoute function. The resulting builder object can then be used to:

Add route-level middleware

Define handlers for each HTTP method

// routes/hello.ts
export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
GET: async ({ request }) => {
return new Response('Hello, World! from ' + request.url)
},
})
Defining a Server Route Handler
There are two ways to define a handler for a server route.

Provide a handler function directly to the method

By calling the handler method on the method builder object for more advanced use cases

Providing a handler function directly to the method
For simple use cases, you can provide a handler function directly to the method.

// routes/hello.ts
export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
GET: async ({ request }) => {
return new Response('Hello, World! from ' + request.url)
},
})
Providing a handler function via the method builder object
For more complex use cases, you can provide a handler function via the method builder object. This allows you to add middleware to the method.

// routes/hello.ts
export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods((api) => ({
GET: api.middleware([loggerMiddleware]).handler(async ({ request }) => {
return new Response('Hello, World! from ' + request.url)
}),
}))
Handler Context
Each HTTP method handler receives an object with the following properties:

request: The incoming request object. You can read more about the Request object in the MDN Web Docs.

params: An object containing the dynamic path parameters of the route. For example, if the route path is /users/$id, and the request is made to /users/123, then params will be { id: '123' }. We'll cover dynamic path parameters and wildcard parameters later in this guide.

context: An object containing the context of the request. This is useful for passing data between middleware.

Once you've processed the request, you can return a Response object or Promise<Response> or even use any of the helpers from @tanstack/react-start to manipulate the response.

Dynamic Path Params
Server routes support dynamic path parameters in the same way as TanStack Router. For example, a file named routes/users/$id.ts will create an API route at /users/$id that accepts a dynamic id parameter.

// routes/users/$id.ts
export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
GET: async ({ params }) => {
const { id } = params
return new Response(`User ID: ${id}`)
},
})

// Visit /users/123 to see the response
// User ID: 123
You can also have multiple dynamic path parameters in a single route. For example, a file named routes/users/$id/posts/$postId.ts will create an API route at /users/$id/posts/$postId that accepts two dynamic parameters.

// routes/users/$id/posts/$postId.ts
export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
GET: async ({ params }) => {
const { id, postId } = params
return new Response(`User ID: ${id}, Post ID: ${postId}`)
},
})

// Visit /users/123/posts/456 to see the response
// User ID: 123, Post ID: 456
Wildcard/Splat Param
Server routes also support wildcard parameters at the end of the path, which are denoted by a $ followed by nothing. For example, a file named routes/file/$.ts will create an API route at /file/$ that accepts a wildcard parameter.

// routes/file/$.ts
export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
GET: async ({ params }) => {
const { \_splat } = params
return new Response(`File: ${_splat}`)
},
})

// Visit /file/hello.txt to see the response
// File: hello.txt
Handling requests with a body
To handle POST requests,you can add a POST handler to the route object. The handler will receive the request object as the first argument, and you can access the request body using the request.json() method.

// routes/hello.ts
export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
POST: async ({ request }) => {
const body = await request.json()
return new Response(`Hello, ${body.name}!`)
},
})

// Send a POST request to /hello with a JSON body like { "name": "Tanner" }
// Hello, Tanner!
This also applies to other HTTP methods like PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. You can add handlers for these methods in the route object and access the request body using the appropriate method.

It's important to remember that the request.json() method returns a Promise that resolves to the parsed JSON body of the request. You need to await the result to access the body.

This is a common pattern for handling POST requests in Server routes/ You can also use other methods like request.text() or request.formData() to access the body of the request.

Responding with JSON
When returning JSON using a Response object, this is a common pattern:

// routes/hello.ts
export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
GET: async ({ request }) => {
return new Response(JSON.stringify({ message: 'Hello, World!' }), {
headers: {
'Content-Type': 'application/json',
},
})
},
})

// Visit /hello to see the response
// {"message":"Hello, World!"}
Using the json helper function
Or you can use the json helper function to automatically set the Content-Type header to application/json and serialize the JSON object for you.

// routes/hello.ts
import { json } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
GET: async ({ request }) => {
return json({ message: 'Hello, World!' })
},
})

// Visit /hello to see the response
// {"message":"Hello, World!"}
Responding with a status code
You can set the status code of the response by either:

Passing it as a property of the second argument to the Response constructor

// routes/hello.ts
import { json } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
GET: async ({ request, params }) => {
const user = await findUser(params.id)
if (!user) {
return new Response('User not found', {
status: 404,
})
}
return json(user)
},
})
Using the setResponseStatus helper function from @tanstack/react-start/server

// routes/hello.ts
import { json } from '@tanstack/react-start'
import { setResponseStatus } from '@tanstack/react-start/server'

export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
GET: async ({ request, params }) => {
const user = await findUser(params.id)
if (!user) {
setResponseStatus(404)
return new Response('User not found')
}
return json(user)
},
})
In this example, we're returning a 404 status code if the user is not found. You can set any valid HTTP status code using this method.

Setting headers in the response
Sometimes you may need to set headers in the response. You can do this by either:

Passing an object as the second argument to the Response constructor.

// routes/hello.ts
export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
GET: async ({ request }) => {
return new Response('Hello, World!', {
headers: {
'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
},
})
},
})

// Visit /hello to see the response
// Hello, World!
Or using the setHeaders helper function from @tanstack/react-start/server.

// routes/hello.ts
import { setHeaders } from '@tanstack/react-start/server'

export const ServerRoute = createServerFileRoute().methods({
GET: async ({ request }) => {
setHeaders({
'Content-Type': 'text/plain',
})
return new Response('Hello, World!')
},
})

Selective SSR –
Selective Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
What is Selective SSR?
In TanStack Start, routes matching the initial request are rendered on the server by default. This means beforeLoad and loader are executed on the server, followed by rendering the route components. The resulting HTML is sent to the client, which hydrates the markup into a fully interactive application.

However, there are cases where you might want to disable SSR for certain routes or all routes, such as:

When beforeLoad or loader requires browser-only APIs (e.g., localStorage).

When the route component depends on browser-only APIs (e.g., canvas).

TanStack Start's Selective SSR feature lets you configure:

Which routes should execute beforeLoad or loader on the server.

Which route components should be rendered on the server.

How does this compare to SPA mode?
TanStack Start's SPA mode completely disables server-side execution of beforeLoad and loader, as well as server-side rendering of route components. Selective SSR allows you to configure server-side handling on a per-route basis, either statically or dynamically.

Configuration
You can control how a route is handled during the initial server request using the ssr property. If this property is not set, it defaults to true. You can change this default using the defaultSsr option in createRouter:

// src/router.tsx
import { createRouter as createTanStackRouter } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { routeTree } from './routeTree.gen'

export function createRouter() {
const router = createTanStackRouter({
routeTree,
scrollRestoration: true,
defaultPendingComponent: () => <div>Loading...</div>,
// Disable SSR by default
defaultSsr: false,
})

return router
}
ssr: true
This is the default behavior unless otherwise configured. On the initial request, it will:

Run beforeLoad on the server and send the resulting context to the client.

Run loader on the server and send the loader data to the client.

Render the component on the server and send the HTML markup to the client.

// src/routes/posts/$postId.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute('/posts/$postId')({
ssr: true,
beforeLoad: () => {
console.log('Executes on the server during the initial request')
console.log('Executes on the client for subsequent navigation')
},
loader: () => {
console.log('Executes on the server during the initial request')
console.log('Executes on the client for subsequent navigation')
},
component: () => <div>This component is rendered on the server</div>,
})
ssr: false
This disables server-side:

Execution of the route's beforeLoad and loader.

Rendering of the route component.

// src/routes/posts/$postId.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute('/posts/$postId')({
ssr: false,
beforeLoad: () => {
console.log('Executes on the client during hydration')
},
loader: () => {
console.log('Executes on the client during hydration')
},
component: () => <div>This component is rendered on the client</div>,
})
ssr: 'data-only'
This hybrid option will:

Run beforeLoad on the server and send the resulting context to the client.

Run loader on the server and send the loader data to the client.

Disable server-side rendering of the route component.

// src/routes/posts/$postId.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute('/posts/$postId')({
ssr: 'data-only',
beforeLoad: () => {
console.log('Executes on the server during the initial request')
console.log('Executes on the client for subsequent navigation')
},
loader: () => {
console.log('Executes on the server during the initial request')
console.log('Executes on the client for subsequent navigation')
},
component: () => <div>This component is rendered on the client</div>,
})
Functional Form
For more flexibility, you can use the functional form of the ssr property to decide at runtime whether to SSR a route:

// src/routes/docs/$docType/$docId.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute('/docs/$docType/$docId')({
validateSearch: z.object({ details: z.boolean().optional() }),
ssr: ({ params, search }) => {
if (params.status === 'success' && params.value.docType === 'sheet') {
return false
}
if (search.status === 'success' && search.value.details) {
return 'data-only'
}
},
beforeLoad: () => {
console.log('Executes on the server depending on the result of ssr()')
},
loader: () => {
console.log('Executes on the server depending on the result of ssr()')
},
component: () => <div>This component is rendered on the client</div>,
})
The ssr function runs only on the server during the initial request and is stripped from the client bundle.

search and params are passed in after validation as a discriminated union:

params:
| { status: 'success'; value: Expand<ResolveAllParamsFromParent<TParentRoute, TParams>> }
| { status: 'error'; error: unknown }
search:
| { status: 'success'; value: Expand<ResolveFullSearchSchema<TParentRoute, TSearchValidator>> }
| { status: 'error'; error: unknown }
If validation fails, status will be error and error will contain the failure details. Otherwise, status will be success and value will contain the validated data.

Inheritance
At runtime, a child route inherits the Selective SSR configuration of its parent. However, the inherited value can only be changed to be more restrictive (i.e. true to data-only or false and data-only to false). For example:

root { ssr: undefined }
posts { ssr: false }
$postId { ssr: true }
root defaults to ssr: true.

posts explicitly sets ssr: false, so neither beforeLoad nor loader will run on the server, and the route component won't be rendered on the server.

$postId sets ssr: true, but inherits ssr: false from its parent. Because the inherited value can only be changed to be more restrictive, ssr: true has no effect and the inherited ssr: false will remain.

Another example:

root { ssr: undefined }
posts { ssr: 'data-only' }
$postId { ssr: true }
details { ssr: false }
root defaults to ssr: true.

posts sets ssr: 'data-only', so beforeLoad and loader run on the server, but the route component isn't rendered on the server.

$postId sets ssr: true, but inherits ssr: 'data-only' from its parent.

details sets ssr: false, so neither beforeLoad nor loader will run on the server, and the route component won't be rendered on the server. Here the inherited value is changed to be more restrictive, and therefore, the ssr: false will override the inherited value.

Fallback Rendering
For the first route with ssr: false or ssr: 'data-only', the server will render the route's pendingComponent as a fallback. If pendingComponent isn't configured, the defaultPendingComponent will be rendered. If neither is configured, no fallback will be rendered.

On the client during hydration, this fallback will be displayed for at least minPendingMs (or defaultPendingMinMs if not configured), even if the route doesn't have beforeLoad or loader defined.

SPA Mode –
SPA mode
What the heck is SPA mode?
For applications that do not require SSR for either SEO, crawlers, or performance reasons, it may be desirable to ship static HTML to your users containing the "shell" of your application (or even prerendered HTML for specific routes) that contain the necessary html, head, and body tags to bootstrap your application only on the client.

Why use Start without SSR?
No SSR doesn't mean giving up server-side features! SPA modes actually pair very nicely with server-side features like server functions and/or server routes or even other external APIs. It simply means that the initial document will not contain the fully rendered HTML of your application until it has been rendered on the client using JavaScript.

Benefits of SPA mode
Easier to deploy - A CDN that can serve static assets is all you need.

Cheaper to host - CDNs are cheap compared to Lambda functions or long-running processes.

Client-side Only is simpler - No SSR means less to go wrong with hydration, rendering, and routing.

Caveats of SPA mode
Slower time to full content - Time to full content is longer since all JS must download and execute before anything below the shell can be rendered.

Less SEO friendly - Robots, crawlers and link unfurlers may have a harder time indexing your application unless they are configured to execute JS and your application can render within a reasonable amount of time.

How does it work?
After enabling the SPA mode, running a Start build will have an additional prerendering step afterwards to generate the shell. This is done by:

Prerendering your application's root route only

Where your application would normally render your matched routes, your router's configured pending fallback component is rendered instead.

The resulting HTML is stored to a static HTML page called /\_shell.html (configurable)

Default rewrites are configured to redirect all 404 requests to the SPA mode shell

[!NOTE]
Other routes may also be prerendered and it is recommended to prerender as much as you can in SPA mode, but this is not required for SPA mode to work.

Configuring SPA mode
To configure SPA mode, there are a few options you can add to your Start plugin's options:

// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
plugins: [
TanStackStart({
spa: {
enabled: true,
},
}),
],
})
Use Necessary Redirects
Deploying a purely client-side SPA to a host or CDN often requires the use of redirects to ensure that urls are properly rewritten to the SPA shell. The goal of any deployment should include these priorities in this order:

Ensure that static assets will always be served if they exist, e.g. /about.html. This is usually the default behavior for most CDNs

(Optional) Allow-list specific subpaths to be routed through to any dynamic server handlers, e.g. /api/\*\* (More on this below)

Ensure that all 404 requests are rewritten to the SPA shell, e.g. a catch-all redirect to /\_shell.html (or if you have configured your shell output path to be something custom, use that instead)

Basic Redirects Example
Let's use Netlify's \_redirects file to rewrite all 404 requests to the SPA shell.

# Catch all other 404 requests and rewrite them to the SPA shell

/\* /\_shell.html 200
Allowing Server Functions and Server Routes
Again, using Netlify's \_redirects file, we can allow-list specific subpaths to be routed through to the server.

# Allow requests to /\_serverFn/\* to be routed through to the server (If you have configured your server function base path to be something other than /\_serverFn, use that instead)

/\_serverFn/\* /\_serverFn/:splat 200

# Allow any requests to /api/\* to be routed through to the server (Server routes can be created at any path, so you must ensure that any server routes you want to use are under this path, or simply add additional redirects for each server route base you want to expose)

/api/\* /api/:splat 200

# Catch all other 404 requests and rewrite them to the SPA shell

/\* /\_shell.html 200
Shell Mask Path
The default pathname used to generate the SPA shell is /. We call this the shell mask path. Since matched routes are not included, the pathname used to generate the shell is mostly irrelevant, but it's still configurable.

[!NOTE]
It's recommended to keep the default value of / as the shell mask path.

// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
plugins: [
tanstackStart({
spa: {
maskPath: '/app',
},
}),
],
})
Prerendering Options
The prerender option is used to configure the prerendering behavior of the SPA shell, and accepts the same prerender options as found in our prerendering guide.

By default, the following prerender options are set:

outputPath: /\_shell.html

crawlLinks: false

retryCount: 0

This means that by default, the shell will not be crawled for links to follow for additional prerendering, and will not retry prerendering fails.

You can always override these options by providing your own prerender options:

// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
plugins: [
TanStackStart({
spa: {
prerender: {
outputPath: '/custom-shell',
crawlLinks: true,
retryCount: 3,
},
},
}),
],
})
Customized rendering in SPA mode
Customizing the HTML output of the SPA shell can be useful if you want to:

Provide generic head tags for SPA routes

Provide a custom pending fallback component

Change literally anything about the shell's HTML, CSS, and JS

To make this process simple, an isShell() function can be found on the router instance:

// src/routes/root.tsx
export default function Root() {
const isShell = useRouter().isShell()

if (isShell) console.log('Rendering the shell!')
}
You can use this boolean to conditionally render different UI based on whether the current route is a shell or not, but keep in mind that after hydrating the shell, the router will immediately navigate to the first route and isShell() will return false. This could produce flashes of unstyled content if not handled properly.

Dynamic Data in your Shell
Since the shell is prerendered using the SSR build of your application, any loaders, or server-specific functionality defined on your Root Route will run during the prerendering process and the data will be included in the shell.

This means that you can use dynamic data in your shell by using a loader or server-specific functionality.

// src/routes/\_\_root.tsx

export const RootRoute = createRootRoute({
loader: async () => {
return {
name: 'Tanner',
}
},
component: Root,
})

export default function Root() {
const { name } = useLoaderData()

return (

<html>
<body>
<h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
<Outlet />
</body>
</html>
)
}

Static Prerendering –
Static Prerendering
Static prerendering is the process of generating static HTML files for your application. This can be useful for either improving the performance of your application, as it allows you to serve pre-rendered HTML files to users without having to generate them on the fly or for deploying static sites to platforms that do not support server-side rendering.

Prerendering
TanStack Start can prerender your application to static HTML files, which can then be served to users without having to generate them on the fly. To prerender your application, you can add the prerender option to your tanstackStart configuration in vite.config.ts file:

// vite.config.ts

import { tanstackStart } from '@tanstack/react-start/plugin/vite'

export default defineConfig({
plugins: [
tanstackStart({
prerender: {
// Enable prerendering
enabled: true,

        // Enable if you need pages to be at `/page/index.html` instead of `/page.html`
        autoSubfolderIndex: true,

        // How many prerender jobs to run at once
        concurrency: 14,

        // Whether to extract links from the HTML and prerender them also
        crawlLinks: true,

        // Filter function takes the page object and returns whether it should prerender
        filter: ({ path }) => !path.startsWith('/do-not-render-me'),

        // Number of times to retry a failed prerender job
        retryCount: 2,

        // Delay between retries in milliseconds
        retryDelay: 1000,

        // Callback when page is successfully rendered
        onSuccess: (page) => {
          console.log(`Rendered ${page.path}!`)
        },
      },
      // Optional configuration for specific pages (without this it will still automatically
      // prerender all routes)
      pages: [
        {
          path: '/my-page',
          prerender: { enabled: true, outputPath: '/my-page/index.html' },
        },
      ],
    }),

],
})

Path Aliases –
Path Aliases
Path aliases are a useful feature of TypeScript that allows you to define a shortcut for a path that could be distant in your project's directory structure. This can help you avoid long relative imports in your code and make it easier to refactor your project's structure. This is especially useful for avoiding long relative imports in your code.

By default, TanStack Start does not include path aliases. However, you can easily add them to your project by updating your tsconfig.json file in the root of your project and adding the following configuration:

{
"compilerOptions": {
"baseUrl": ".",
"paths": {
"~/_": ["./src/_"]
}
}
}
In this example, we've defined the path alias ~/_ that maps to the ./src/_ directory. This means that you can now import files from the src directory using the ~ prefix.

After updating your tsconfig.json file, you'll need to install the vite-tsconfig-paths plugin to enable path aliases in your TanStack Start project. You can do this by running the following command:

npm install -D vite-tsconfig-paths
Now, you'll need to update your app.config.ts file to include the following:

// app.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@tanstack/react-start/config'
import viteTsConfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'

export default defineConfig({
vite: {
plugins: [
// this is the plugin that enables path aliases
viteTsConfigPaths({
projects: ['./tsconfig.json'],
}),
],
},
})
Once this configuration has completed, you'll now be able to import files using the path alias like so:

// app/routes/posts/$postId/edit.tsx
import { Input } from '~/components/ui/input'

// instead of

import { Input } from '../../../components/ui/input'

Tailwind CSS Integration

Tailwind CSS Integration
So you want to use Tailwind CSS in your TanStack Start project?

This guide will help you use Tailwind CSS in your TanStack Start project.

Tailwind CSS Version 4 (Latest)
The latest version of Tailwind CSS is 4. And it has some configuration changes that majorly differ from Tailwind CSS Version 3. It's easier and recommended to set up Tailwind CSS Version 4 in a TanStack Start project, as TanStack Start uses Vite as its build tool.

Install Tailwind CSS
Install Tailwind CSS and it's Vite plugin.

shell

npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
Configure The Vite Plugin
Add the @tailwindcss/vite plugin to your Vite configuration.

ts

// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import tsConfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'
import { tanstackStart } from '@tanstack/react-start/plugin/vite'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'

export default defineConfig({
server: {
port: 3000,
},
plugins: [tsConfigPaths(), tanstackStart(), tailwindcss()],
})
Import Tailwind in your CSS file
You need to create a CSS file to configure Tailwind CSS instead of the configuration file in version 4. You can do this by creating a src/styles/app.css file or name it whatever you want.

css

/_ src/styles/app.css _/
@import 'tailwindcss';
Import the CSS file in your **root.tsx file
Import the CSS file in your **root.tsx file with the ?url query and make sure to add the triple slash directive to the top of the file.

tsx

// src/routes/\_\_root.tsx
/// <reference types="vite/client" />
// other imports...

import appCss from '../styles/app.css?url'

export const Route = createRootRoute({
head: () => ({
meta: [
// your meta tags and site config
],
links: [{ rel: 'stylesheet', href: appCss }],
// other head config
}),
component: RootComponent,
})
Use Tailwind CSS anywhere in your project
You can now use Tailwind CSS anywhere in your project.

tsx

// src/routes/index.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/')({
component: Home,
})

function Home() {

# Teams Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Teams feature allows Quadball Canada members to create and manage teams, invite members, and prepare for event registrations. This document covers the complete implementation including database schema, server functions, UI components, and known issues.

## Implementation Status

- **Status**: ✅ Complete (January 2025)
- **Database**: teams, team_members tables
- **Features**: Create, manage, browse teams; member invitations and roles
- **Known Issues**: TypeScript type inference with TanStack Start

## Database Schema

### Teams Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE teams (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  slug TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  description TEXT,
  created_by TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES user(id),
  city TEXT,
  province TEXT,
  primary_color TEXT DEFAULT '#000000',
  secondary_color TEXT DEFAULT '#ffffff',
  founded_year INTEGER,
  website TEXT,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('active', 'inactive')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Team Members Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE team_members (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  team_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES user(id),
  role TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'player',
  jersey_number TEXT,
  position TEXT,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'active',
  joined_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  invited_at TIMESTAMP,
  invited_by TEXT REFERENCES user(id),
  UNIQUE(team_id, user_id)
);
```

### Member Roles

- `captain` - Team leader with full management permissions
- `coach` - Can manage roster and team details
- `player` - Regular team member
- `substitute` - Backup player

## Server Functions

### Query Functions (`teams.queries.ts`)

```typescript
// Get single team with creator info
getTeam({ teamId: string }): Promise<TeamWithCreator>

// List teams for a user
listTeams({
  userId?: string,
  includeInactive?: boolean
}): Promise<TeamListItem[]>

// Get team members with user details
getTeamMembers({ teamId: string }): Promise<TeamMemberWithUser[]>

// Search teams by name or city
searchTeams({ query: string }): Promise<TeamSearchResult[]>

// Check if user can manage team
canUserManageTeam({
  teamId: string,
  userId: string
}): Promise<boolean>
```

### Mutation Functions (`teams.mutations.ts`)

```typescript
// Create new team
createTeam(data: CreateTeamInput): Promise<Team>

// Update team details
updateTeam(data: UpdateTeamInput): Promise<Team>

// Add member to team
addTeamMember(data: AddTeamMemberInput): Promise<TeamMember>

// Update member role/details
updateTeamMember(data: UpdateTeamMemberInput): Promise<TeamMember>

// Remove member from team
removeTeamMember({
  teamId: string,
  memberId: string
}): Promise<void>

// Deactivate team (soft delete)
deactivateTeam({ teamId: string }): Promise<void>
```

## UI Components

### Routes

- `/dashboard/teams` - List user's teams
- `/dashboard/teams/create` - Create new team form
- `/dashboard/teams/browse` - Browse all public teams
- `/dashboard/teams/$teamId` - Team detail page
- `/dashboard/teams/$teamId/manage` - Team settings
- `/dashboard/teams/$teamId/members` - Member management

### Key Features

1. **Team Creation**
   - Multi-field form with validation
   - Auto-generated URL slug
   - Color picker for team colors
   - Optional fields for location, website

2. **Team Management**
   - Edit team details
   - Deactivate team
   - Only captains and coaches can manage

3. **Member Management**
   - Invite by email
   - Assign roles and jersey numbers
   - Remove members
   - Role-based permissions

4. **Team Discovery**
   - Browse all active teams
   - Search by name or city
   - View team details and member count

## TypeScript Workaround

Due to TanStack Start's type inference limitations with server function validators, we use type assertions:

```typescript
// In route loaders and components
await getTeam({
  teamId: params.teamId,
  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
} as any); // Type assertion workaround
```

See `/docs/teams-typescript-errors.md` for detailed explanation.

## Permissions Model

### Team Creation

- Any authenticated user with complete profile can create teams
- User becomes team captain automatically

### Team Management

- Captains: Full access to all features
- Coaches: Can manage team and members
- Players/Substitutes: View only

### Member Management

- Captains/Coaches can add/remove members
- Members can only remove themselves
- Email invitations require user to exist in system

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Team

```typescript
import { createTeam } from "~/features/teams/teams.mutations";

const team = await createTeam({
  name: "Toronto Titans",
  slug: "toronto-titans",
  description: "Competitive team based in Toronto",
  city: "Toronto",
  province: "ON",
  primaryColor: "#FF0000",
  secondaryColor: "#FFFFFF",
  foundedYear: 2024,
  website: "https://torontotitans.com",
});
```

### Adding a Member

```typescript
import { addTeamMember } from "~/features/teams/teams.mutations";

const member = await addTeamMember({
  teamId: "team-123",
  email: "player@example.com",
  role: "player",
  jerseyNumber: "42",
  position: "Chaser",
});
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Invitations**: Send actual invite emails via SendGrid
2. **Team Applications**: Allow users to apply to join teams
3. **Team Statistics**: Track game history and stats
4. **Media Upload**: Team logos and photos via Cloudinary
5. **Event Registration**: Register teams for tournaments
6. **Team Announcements**: Internal team communication

## Testing

### Database Migrations

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

### Test Data

Create test teams in development:

```sql
INSERT INTO teams (id, name, slug, created_by, city, province)
VALUES
  ('test-1', 'Test Team 1', 'test-team-1', 'user-id', 'Toronto', 'ON'),
  ('test-2', 'Test Team 2', 'test-team-2', 'user-id', 'Vancouver', 'BC');
```

### UI Testing

1. Create team at `/dashboard/teams/create`
2. View team list at `/dashboard/teams`
3. Browse teams at `/dashboard/teams/browse`
4. Manage members at `/dashboard/teams/{id}/members`

## Known Issues

1. **TypeScript Errors**: False positives with server function calls
   - Workaround: Type assertions with eslint-disable
   - Tracking: TanStack Router Issue #2759

2. **Email Invitations**: Currently only validates email exists
   - Future: Send actual invitation emails
   - Current: User must be pre-registered

3. **Permissions UI**: Limited feedback on permission errors
   - Enhancement: Better error messages for unauthorized actions

# Testing Server Functions in Production

This guide covers various approaches to test TanStack Start server functions in production environments.

## 1. Health Check Endpoints

Create dedicated API routes for monitoring:

```typescript
// src/routes/api/health/membership.ts
import { createAPIFileRoute } from "@tanstack/start/api";
import { listMembershipTypes } from "~/features/membership";
import { db } from "~/db";
import { sql } from "drizzle-orm";

export default createAPIFileRoute("/api/health/membership")({
  GET: async () => {
    try {
      // Test database connection
      await db().execute(sql`SELECT 1`);

      // Test membership types query
      const types = await db().select().from(membershipTypes).limit(1);

      return new Response(
        JSON.stringify({
          status: "healthy",
          timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
          checks: {
            database: "connected",
            membershipTypes: types.length > 0 ? "available" : "empty",
          },
        }),
        {
          status: 200,
          headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        },
      );
    } catch (error) {
      return new Response(
        JSON.stringify({
          status: "unhealthy",
          error: error.message,
          timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        }),
        {
          status: 503,
          headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        },
      );
    }
  },
});
```

## 2. Integration Tests with Playwright

Create end-to-end tests that run against production:

```typescript
// tests/e2e/membership.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

test.describe("Membership Flow", () => {
  test("should display membership types", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto("/dashboard/membership");

    // Should see membership types
    await expect(page.getByText("Annual Player Membership")).toBeVisible();
    await expect(page.getByText("$45.00")).toBeVisible();
  });

  test("should handle checkout flow", async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto("/dashboard/membership");

    // Click purchase button
    await page.getByRole("button", { name: "Purchase Membership" }).click();

    // Should redirect to mock checkout
    await expect(page).toHaveURL(/mock_checkout=true/);
  });
});
```

## 3. Production Monitoring

### Using Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

Add monitoring to your server functions:

```typescript
// src/features/membership/membership.queries.ts
import { logger } from "~/lib/monitoring";

export const listMembershipTypes = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(async () => {
  const startTime = Date.now();

  try {
    const result = await db()
      .select()
      .from(membershipTypes)
      .where(eq(membershipTypes.status, "active"));

    // Log successful operations
    logger.info("membership.list", {
      duration: Date.now() - startTime,
      count: result.length,
    });

    return { success: true, data: result };
  } catch (error) {
    // Log errors with context
    logger.error("membership.list.error", {
      error: error.message,
      duration: Date.now() - startTime,
    });

    throw error;
  }
});
```

### Recommended APM Services for Production:

- **Sentry** - Error tracking and performance monitoring
- **New Relic** - Full stack observability
- **Datadog** - Infrastructure and APM
- **LogRocket** - Session replay with network requests

## 4. Synthetic Monitoring

Set up automated checks that run periodically:

```typescript
// scripts/synthetic-check.ts
import fetch from "node-fetch";

const PRODUCTION_URL = process.env.PRODUCTION_URL;
const SLACK_WEBHOOK = process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK;

async function checkMembershipAPI() {
  try {
    // Check health endpoint
    const healthRes = await fetch(`${PRODUCTION_URL}/api/health/membership`);
    const health = await healthRes.json();

    if (health.status !== "healthy") {
      await notifySlack(`🚨 Membership API unhealthy: ${health.error}`);
      return;
    }

    // Check actual functionality (with test user)
    const loginRes = await fetch(`${PRODUCTION_URL}/api/auth/login`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        email: process.env.TEST_USER_EMAIL,
        password: process.env.TEST_USER_PASSWORD,
      }),
    });

    if (!loginRes.ok) {
      await notifySlack("🚨 Test user login failed");
      return;
    }

    console.log("✅ All checks passed");
  } catch (error) {
    await notifySlack(`🚨 Synthetic check failed: ${error.message}`);
  }
}

// Run this via cron job or GitHub Actions
checkMembershipAPI();
```

## 5. Manual Testing Checklist

For production deployments, follow this checklist:

### Pre-deployment

- [ ] Run full test suite locally
- [ ] Test with production-like data volume
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set
- [ ] Check database migrations are applied

### Post-deployment

- [ ] Check health endpoints return 200
- [ ] Verify membership types load
- [ ] Test purchase flow with test account
- [ ] Check error tracking for any new errors
- [ ] Monitor response times for degradation

## 6. Database Query Monitoring

Add query performance tracking:

```sql
-- Check slow queries
SELECT
  query,
  calls,
  mean_exec_time,
  total_exec_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE query LIKE '%membership%'
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check table sizes
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE tablename IN ('memberships', 'membership_types')
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;
```

## 7. Load Testing

Use tools like k6 or Artillery for load testing:

```javascript
// k6-test.js
import http from "k6/http";
import { check } from "k6";

export const options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: "30s", target: 20 },
    { duration: "1m", target: 20 },
    { duration: "30s", target: 0 },
  ],
};

export default function () {
  // Test membership types endpoint
  const res = http.get(`${__ENV.PRODUCTION_URL}/api/membership/types`);

  check(res, {
    "status is 200": (r) => r.status === 200,
    "response time < 500ms": (r) => r.timings.duration < 500,
    "has membership types": (r) => {
      const body = JSON.parse(r.body);
      return body.data && body.data.length > 0;
    },
  });
}
```

## 8. Feature Flags for Safe Testing

Use feature flags to test in production safely:

```typescript
// src/lib/feature-flags.ts
export async function isFeatureEnabled(
  feature: string,
  userId?: string,
): Promise<boolean> {
  // Check if user is in test group
  if (userId && TEST_USER_IDS.includes(userId)) {
    return true;
  }

  // Check global feature flags
  return ENABLED_FEATURES.includes(feature);
}

// In your server function
if (await isFeatureEnabled("new-membership-flow", session.user.id)) {
  // New implementation
} else {
  // Existing implementation
}
```

## 9. Rollback Strategy

Have a plan for quick rollbacks:

1. **Database migrations**: Keep rollback scripts ready
2. **Feature flags**: Can disable features without deployment
3. **Blue-green deployments**: Switch traffic between versions
4. **Database backups**: Before any major changes

## 10. Production Debugging

When issues occur in production:

```typescript
// Add debug endpoints (protect with auth!)
export default createAPIFileRoute("/api/debug/membership")({
  GET: async ({ request }) => {
    // Check auth header
    const auth = request.headers.get("X-Debug-Token");
    if (auth !== process.env.DEBUG_TOKEN) {
      return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
    }

    // Return detailed debug info
    const debugInfo = {
      environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
      databaseUrl: process.env.DATABASE_URL ? "set" : "missing",
      squareEnv: process.env.SQUARE_ENV || "not set",
      membershipTypesCount: await db()
        .select({ count: sql<number>`count(*)` })
        .from(membershipTypes),
      recentErrors: await getRecentErrors(),
    };

    return Response.json(debugInfo);
  },
});
```

## Key Recommendations

1. **Start with health checks** - Basic endpoints to verify services are running
2. **Use structured logging** - Makes debugging production issues easier
3. **Monitor key metrics** - Response times, error rates, business metrics
4. **Test with production-like data** - Volume and complexity matter
5. **Have rollback plans** - Be able to revert quickly if issues arise
6. **Use feature flags** - Test new features with subset of users first
7. **Document everything** - Keep runbooks for common issues

Remember: Production testing should be careful and methodical. Always have monitoring in place before deploying new features.

# User Roles, Tags, and Permissions System Design V2

## Overview

This document outlines a hybrid system combining:

- **Roles**: For access control and permissions
- **Tags**: For categorization, searching, and filtering users
- **Membership Status**: Tracked separately through the existing membership system

## System Architecture

### 1. Roles (Access Control)

Roles determine what users can do in the system. Users can have multiple roles.

#### Role Types

| Role                      | Scope          | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Solstice Admin**        | Global         | Full system access, can manage infrastructure, all organizations |
| **Quadball Canada Admin** | Organization   | Manage all Quadball Canada operations (teams, events, members)   |
| **Team Admin**            | Team-specific  | Manage specific team(s) - roster, registration, team details     |
| **Event Admin**           | Event-specific | Manage specific event(s) - registration, scheduling, results     |

### 2. Tags (Categorization)

Tags are descriptive labels that don't affect permissions but enable:

- Searching and filtering users
- Automated communications (e.g., email all referees)
- Statistical reporting
- Event staffing assignments

#### Tag Categories

**Official Tags:**

- Head Referee
- Assistant Referee
- Flag Runner

**Team Tags:**

- Coach
- Captain

**Player Tags:**

- Adult
- Youth
- Full Contact Player
- Low Contact Player

**Custom Tags:**

- Can be added by admins for specific needs

### 3. Membership Status

Membership is tracked separately as it's time-bound and affects:

- Event registration eligibility
- Team roster eligibility
- Access to member benefits

This should remain in the existing membership system, not as a role or tag.

## Database Schema

### 1. Roles Schema

```sql
-- Global roles table
CREATE TABLE roles (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  description TEXT,
  permissions JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- User role assignments with optional scope
CREATE TABLE user_roles (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES user(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES roles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  -- Scope fields (NULL for global roles)
  team_id TEXT REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  event_id TEXT REFERENCES events(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  -- Metadata
  assigned_by TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES user(id),
  assigned_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  notes TEXT,
  -- Constraints
  CONSTRAINT valid_scope CHECK (
    (role_id IN (SELECT id FROM roles WHERE name IN ('Solstice Admin', 'Quadball Canada Admin'))
     AND team_id IS NULL AND event_id IS NULL)
    OR
    (role_id IN (SELECT id FROM roles WHERE name = 'Team Admin')
     AND team_id IS NOT NULL AND event_id IS NULL)
    OR
    (role_id IN (SELECT id FROM roles WHERE name = 'Event Admin')
     AND event_id IS NOT NULL AND team_id IS NULL)
  )
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_user_roles_user_id ON user_roles(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_roles_team_id ON user_roles(team_id) WHERE team_id IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_user_roles_event_id ON user_roles(event_id) WHERE event_id IS NOT NULL;
```

### 2. Tags Schema

```sql
-- Tag definitions
CREATE TABLE tags (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  category TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'official', 'team', 'player', 'custom'
  description TEXT,
  color TEXT, -- For UI display
  icon TEXT, -- Icon identifier
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- User tags (many-to-many)
CREATE TABLE user_tags (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES user(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  tag_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES tags(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  -- Optional metadata
  assigned_by TEXT REFERENCES user(id),
  assigned_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP, -- For temporary tags
  notes TEXT,
  UNIQUE(user_id, tag_id)
);

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_user_tags_user_id ON user_tags(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_tags_tag_id ON user_tags(tag_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_tags_expires_at ON user_tags(expires_at) WHERE expires_at IS NOT NULL;
```

### 3. Seed Data

```sql
-- Insert default roles
INSERT INTO roles (name, description, permissions) VALUES
  ('Solstice Admin', 'Platform administrator with full system access', '{"*": true}'),
  ('Quadball Canada Admin', 'Quadball Canada organization administrator', '{"quadball_canada.*": true}'),
  ('Team Admin', 'Team-specific administrator', '{"team.*": true}'),
  ('Event Admin', 'Event-specific administrator', '{"event.*": true}');

-- Insert default tags
INSERT INTO tags (name, category, description, color) VALUES
  -- Officials
  ('Head Referee', 'official', 'Certified head referee', '#FF6B6B'),
  ('Assistant Referee', 'official', 'Certified assistant referee', '#4ECDC4'),
  ('Flag Runner', 'official', 'Certified flag runner', '#45B7D1'),
  -- Team roles
  ('Coach', 'team', 'Team coach', '#96CEB4'),
  ('Captain', 'team', 'Team captain', '#FECA57'),
  -- Player categories
  ('Adult', 'player', 'Adult player (18+)', '#6C5CE7'),
  ('Youth', 'player', 'Youth player (under 18)', '#A29BFE'),
  ('Full Contact Player', 'player', 'Plays full contact', '#EE5A24'),
  ('Low Contact Player', 'player', 'Plays low/no contact variant', '#F79F1F');
```

## Implementation

### 1. Types and Interfaces

```typescript
// src/lib/auth/roles.types.ts

### 2. Permission Service

```typescript

        ),
      )
      .limit(1);

    return adminRoles.length > 0;
  }
}
```

### 3. Tag Service

```typescript
// src/features/tags/tag.service.ts
export class TagService {
  static async getUserTags(userId: string): Promise<Tag[]> {
    const tags = await db
      .select({
        id: tags.id,

  // Programmatic tag updates
  static async updateRefereeTagsAfterCertification(userId: string, level: string) {
    // Remove old referee tags
    // Add new referee tag based on certification level
  }
}
```

### 4. Updated Auth Context

```typescript
// src/lib/auth/types.ts
export interface User extends BetterAuthUser {
  // ... existing fields ...
  roles?: UserRole[];
  tags?: Tag[];
  activeMembership?: {
    id: string;
    type: string;
    expiresAt: Date;
    year: number;
  };
}

// src/features/auth/auth.queries.ts
export const getCurrentUser = createServerFn({ method: "GET" }).handler(async () => {
  const session = await auth.api.getSession({ headers: await getHeaders() });

  if (!session?.user?.id) return null;

  const [dbUser] = await db
    .select()
    .from(user)
    .where(eq(user.id, session.user.id))
    .limit(1);

  if (!dbUser) return null;

  // Fetch roles with scope
  const userRoles = await db
    .select()
    .from(userRoles)
    .innerJoin(roles, eq(userRoles.roleId, roles.id))
    .leftJoin(teams, eq(userRoles.teamId, teams.id))
    .leftJoin(events, eq(userRoles.eventId, events.id))
    .where(eq(userRoles.userId, dbUser.id));

  // Fetch tags
  const userTags = await TagService.getUserTags(dbUser.id);

  // Fetch active membership
  const activeMembership = await db
    .select()
    .from(memberships)
    .where(
      and(
        eq(memberships.userId, dbUser.id),
        eq(memberships.status, "active"),
        gte(memberships.expiresAt, new Date()),
      ),
    )
    .orderBy(desc(memberships.expiresAt))
    .limit(1);

  return {
    ...dbUser,
    roles: userRoles,
    tags: userTags,
    activeMembership: activeMembership[0] || null,
  };
});
```

### 5. UI Components

```typescript
// User Profile Display
export function UserProfile({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Roles Section */}
      <div className="mb-6">
        <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">Administrative Roles</h3>
        <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
          {user.roles?.map(role => (
            <Badge key={role.id} variant="default">
              {role.role.name}
              {role.teamId && ` - ${role.team?.name}`}
              {role.eventId && ` - ${role.event?.name}`}
            </Badge>
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* Tags Section */}
      <div className="mb-6">
        <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">Tags & Certifications</h3>
        <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
          {user.tags?.map(tag => (
            <Badge
              key={tag.id}
              style={{ backgroundColor: tag.color }}
              className="text-white"
            >
              {tag.icon && <Icon name={tag.icon} className="mr-1" />}
              {tag.name}
            </Badge>
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* Membership Status */}
      <div>
        <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">Membership Status</h3>
        {user.activeMembership ? (
          <p className="text-green-600">
            Active {user.activeMembership.type} Member
            (Expires: {formatDate(user.activeMembership.expiresAt)})
          </p>
        ) : (
          <p className="text-gray-500">No active membership</p>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 6. Search Implementation

```typescript
// src/features/users/user-search.ts
export const searchUsers = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
  .validator(
    z.object({
      tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
      roles: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
      hasActiveMembership: z.boolean().optional(),
      teamId: z.string().optional(),
    }),
  )
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    let query = db.select().from(user);

    // Filter by tags
    if (data.tags?.length) {
      const taggedUsers = await TagService.findUsersByTags(data.tags);
      const userIds = taggedUsers.map((u) => u.id);
      query = query.where(inArray(user.id, userIds));
    }

    // Filter by active membership
    if (data.hasActiveMembership) {
      const memberUsers = await db
        .selectDistinct({ userId: memberships.userId })
        .from(memberships)
        .where(
          and(eq(memberships.status, "active"), gte(memberships.expiresAt, new Date())),
        );
      const userIds = memberUsers.map((m) => m.userId);
      query = query.where(inArray(user.id, userIds));
    }

    return query;
  });
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Assigning Roles

```typescript
// Make someone a Team Admin
await assignRole(userId, "Team Admin", { teamId: "team-123" });

// Make someone a Quadball Canada Admin
await assignRole(userId, "Quadball Canada Admin");
```

### 2. Checking Permissions

```typescript
// Check if user can edit a team
const canEdit = await PermissionService.canUserAccessTeam(userId, teamId);

// Check if user is any kind of admin
const isAdmin = await PermissionService.isGlobalAdmin(userId);
```

### 3. Managing Tags

```typescript
// Tag someone as a Head Referee
await TagService.assignTag(userId, headRefereeTagId, adminUserId);

// Find all certified referees
const referees = await TagService.findUsersByTags(["Head Referee", "Assistant Referee"]);

// Automatically update tags after certification
await TagService.updateRefereeTagsAfterCertification(userId, "head");
```

### 4. Filtering UI Elements

```typescript
// Show Reports tab only for global admins
{user.roles?.some(r =>
  ['Solstice Admin', 'Quadball Canada Admin'].includes(r.role.name)
) && (
  <Link to="/reports">Reports</Link>
)}

// Show team management only for team admins
{user.roles?.some(r =>
  r.role.name === 'Team Admin' && r.teamId === currentTeamId
) && (
  <Button>Manage Team</Button>
)}
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Clear Separation**: Roles control access, tags are for categorization
2. **Flexible Scoping**: Team/Event admins are scoped to specific resources
3. **Searchability**: Easy to find users by tags (e.g., all referees)
4. **Membership Independence**: Membership status remains in its own system
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new roles or tags without schema changes
6. **Performance**: Efficient queries with proper indexes

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Implement roles for access control
2. **Phase 2**: Add tags for categorization
3. **Phase 3**: Build search and filtering features
4. **Phase 4**: Create admin UI for managing roles/tags
5. **Phase 5**: Automated tag management (certifications, etc.)

This design provides the flexibility you need while keeping the concepts clearly separated and maintainable.

## Implementation Plan (Solo Dev Approach)

### Immediate Tasks (4-5 hours total)

1. **Create roles schema file with roles and user_roles tables** (~30 min)
   - Add Drizzle schema definitions for roles system
   - Include proper constraints and indexes

2. **Update schema index to include new roles schema** (~5 min)
   - Export new tables from schema index

3. **Create PermissionService for role-based access checks** (~60-90 min)
   - Simple service class with static methods
   - `isGlobalAdmin()`, `canManageTeam()`, `canManageEvent()`

4. **Update getCurrentUser to include roles data** (~30 min)
   - Fetch user roles with proper joins
   - Include role scope (team/event) information

5. **Hide Reports tab based on user roles** (~30 min)
   - Update admin sidebar to filter items based on permissions
   - Client-side helper for UI-only checks

6. **Add role guards to protected routes** (~30 min)
   - Apply guards to /dashboard/reports, team/event management
   - Use beforeLoad hooks in TanStack Router

7. **Create seed script for default roles** (~20 min)
   - CLI script to insert default roles
   - Assign yourself Solstice Admin role

8. **Write tests for PermissionService** (~45 min)
   - Unit tests with Vitest
   - Cover happy path and edge cases

### Deferred Tasks (Future Iterations)

- Full admin UI for role management (use CLI scripts for now)
- Tag system implementation
- Audit logging
- PostgreSQL RLS
- Caching layer for permission checks

# E2E Authentication Testing Guide

This guide covers different strategies for handling authentication in E2E tests.

## Strategy Comparison

### 1. Shared Authentication State (Recommended)

**Best for:** Most applications, especially when tests don't modify user data

**Pros:**

- Fastest execution (authenticate once, reuse for all tests)
- Simple to implement
- Reduces load on auth system
- Works well with CI/CD

**Cons:**

- Tests can't modify shared user data
- Not suitable for testing user-specific features

**Implementation:**

- Use `auth.setup.ts` to authenticate once before all tests
- Store auth state in `.auth/user.json`
- All tests automatically use authenticated state

### 2. Multiple Test Accounts

**Best for:** Tests that modify user data or need isolation

**Pros:**

- Tests run in parallel without conflicts
- Each test has clean user state
- Can test user-specific features

**Cons:**

- Requires multiple test accounts
- Slower than shared state
- More complex setup

**Implementation:**

- Use worker-scoped fixtures
- Assign different account per worker
- See `fixtures/auth.ts`

### 3. API-Based Authentication

**Best for:** Speed-critical test suites

**Pros:**

- Fastest authentication method
- Bypasses UI login flow
- More stable (no UI changes affect it)

**Cons:**

- Doesn't test actual login UI
- Requires API access
- May not work with all auth providers

**Implementation:**

- Authenticate via API endpoint
- Set cookies/tokens programmatically
- See `utils/api-auth.ts`

### 4. Mock Authentication

**Best for:** Development and unit-like E2E tests

**Pros:**

- No external dependencies
- Instant authentication
- Full control over user state

**Cons:**

- Doesn't test real auth flow
- May miss auth-related bugs
- Requires mock implementation

## Database Strategies

### Option 1: Dedicated Test Database

```bash
# .env.test
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/solstice_test
```

**Setup:**

```typescript
// e2e/global-setup.ts
import { execSync } from "child_process";

export default async function globalSetup() {
  // Reset test database
  execSync("pnpm db:reset:test", { stdio: "inherit" });

  // Seed test data
  execSync("pnpm db:seed:test", { stdio: "inherit" });
}
```

### Option 2: Database Transactions

```typescript
// Wrap each test in a transaction that rolls back
test.beforeEach(async () => {
  await db.transaction().execute(async (trx) => {
    // Test runs here
    // Transaction automatically rolls back
  });
});
```

### Option 3: Docker Test Environment

```yaml
# docker-compose.test.yml
services:
  postgres-test:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: solstice_test
      POSTGRES_USER: test
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: test
    ports:
      - "5433:5432"
```

## Environment Variables

Create `.env.e2e` for E2E test configuration:

```bash
# .env.e2e
E2E_TEST_EMAIL=test@example.com
E2E_TEST_PASSWORD=testpassword123
E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173

# For multiple test users
E2E_TEST_USER_1_EMAIL=test1@example.com
E2E_TEST_USER_1_PASSWORD=password123
E2E_TEST_USER_2_EMAIL=test2@example.com
E2E_TEST_USER_2_PASSWORD=password123
```

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Test with Shared Auth

```typescript
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

test("view dashboard", async ({ page }) => {
  // Already authenticated via setup
  await page.goto("/dashboard");
  await expect(page.getByRole("heading", { name: "Dashboard" })).toBeVisible();
});
```

### Example 2: Test with Isolated User

```typescript
import { test, expect } from "../fixtures/auth";

test("update profile", async ({ authenticatedPage }) => {
  await authenticatedPage.goto("/dashboard/profile");
  await authenticatedPage.getByLabel("Phone").fill("+1234567890");
  await authenticatedPage.getByRole("button", { name: "Save" }).click();

  await expect(authenticatedPage.getByText("Profile updated")).toBeVisible();
});
```

### Example 3: Test Different User Roles

```typescript
// fixtures/roles.ts
export const adminTest = base.extend({
  page: async ({ page }, use) => {
    await loginAsAdmin(page);
    await use(page);
  },
});

export const memberTest = base.extend({
  page: async ({ page }, use) => {
    await loginAsMember(page);
    await use(page);
  },
});

// Usage
adminTest("admin can manage teams", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("/admin/teams");
  // Admin-specific tests
});

memberTest("member can view teams", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("/teams");
  // Member-specific tests
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Environment Variables**
   - Never hardcode credentials
   - Use `.env.e2e` for test configuration
   - Add to `.gitignore`

2. **Clean Up Test Data**
   - Reset database between test runs
   - Use transactions when possible
   - Clean up created resources

3. **Optimize for Speed**
   - Reuse authentication when possible
   - Use API auth for data setup
   - Parallelize with isolated accounts

4. **Handle Flakiness**
   - Add proper waits after login
   - Verify auth state before proceeding
   - Use stable selectors

5. **Security Considerations**
   - Use separate test environment
   - Don't use production credentials
   - Limit test account permissions
   - Rotate test credentials regularly

## CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/e2e.yml
- name: Run E2E tests
  env:
    E2E_TEST_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.E2E_TEST_EMAIL }}
    E2E_TEST_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.E2E_TEST_PASSWORD }}
  run: |
    pnpm db:reset:test
    pnpm db:seed:test
    pnpm test:e2e
```

## Debugging Authentication Issues

1. **Save auth state for debugging:**

```typescript
await page.context().storageState({ path: "debug-auth-state.json" });
```

2. **Check cookies:**

```typescript
const cookies = await page.context().cookies();
console.log("Auth cookies:", cookies);
```

3. **Verify auth in console:**

```typescript
const isAuthenticated = await page.evaluate(() => {
  return !!localStorage.getItem("auth-token");
});
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Run only unauthenticated tests
pnpm test:e2e --project=chromium-no-auth

# Run only authenticated tests
pnpm test:e2e --project=chromium-auth

# Run specific test file
pnpm test:e2e dashboard.auth.spec.ts

# Run with UI mode
pnpm test:e2e:ui

# Run headed (see browser)
pnpm test:e2e --headed
```

## Test Data Setup

Before running tests, ensure test data is seeded:

```bash
# Clean and seed test data
pnpm tsx scripts/clean-test-users.ts && pnpm test:e2e:setup
```

## Environment Configuration

E2E tests use `.env.e2e` for configuration. Copy `.env.e2e.example` to `.env.e2e` and update as needed.

## Writing Tests

### Naming Convention

- `*.unauth.spec.ts` - Tests that must run without authentication
- `*.auth.spec.ts` - Tests that require authentication
- Feature-specific names assume authentication (e.g., `dashboard.spec.ts`)

### Best Practices

1. Use Playwright's recommended locators (getByRole, getByLabel, getByText)
2. Avoid arbitrary timeouts - use proper wait conditions
3. Keep tests isolated and independent
4. Use descriptive test names

## Authentication

The test suite uses Better Auth's password hashing. Test users are created with:

- Email: `test@example.com`
- Password: `testpassword123`

Authentication state is shared across authenticated tests for efficiency.

## CI/CD

E2E tests run automatically on GitHub Actions for every pull request. The workflow:

- Sets up test database
- Seeds test data
- Runs all E2E tests
- Uploads test results as artifacts

# UI Components

This directory contains shadcn/ui components that have been customized for the Quadball Canada platform.

## Base Components (from shadcn/ui)

These components are copied from shadcn/ui and can be customized as needed:

### Core Components

- **Button** (`button.tsx`) - Primary interactive element with variants
- **Card** (`card.tsx`) - Content container with header, content, and footer sections
- **Input** (`input.tsx`) - Form input with consistent styling
- **Label** (`label.tsx`) - Accessible form labels

### Icon System

- **Icons** (`icons.tsx`) - Re-exported Lucide React icons for consistency

## Usage

```tsx
import { Button } from "~/shared/ui/button";
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "~/shared/ui/card";
import { Input } from "~/shared/ui/input";
import { Label } from "~/shared/ui/label";

// Example usage
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Login</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <div>
        <Label htmlFor="email">Email</Label>
        <Input id="email" type="email" />
      </div>
      <Button type="submit">Sign In</Button>
    </div>
  </CardContent>
</Card>;
```

## Adding New Components

To add a new shadcn/ui component:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component-name]
```

This will copy the component into this directory where it can be customized.

## Customization

All components use CSS variables for theming, defined in `src/styles.css`. The theme automatically adjusts for light/dark mode based on the `ThemeProvider` context.

## Documentation

For detailed component documentation and examples, see:

- [shadcn/ui Components](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components)
- [Component Guide](../../../docs/quadball-plan/ui-flows/component-guide.md)

# UI Components

This directory contains shadcn/ui components that have been customized for the Quadball Canada platform.

## Base Components (from shadcn/ui)

These components are copied from shadcn/ui and can be customized as needed:

### Core Components

- **Button** (`button.tsx`) - Primary interactive element with variants
- **Card** (`card.tsx`) - Content container with header, content, and footer sections
- **Input** (`input.tsx`) - Form input with consistent styling
- **Label** (`label.tsx`) - Accessible form labels

### Icon System

- **Icons** (`icons.tsx`) - Re-exported Lucide React icons for consistency

## Usage

```tsx
import { Button } from "~/shared/ui/button";
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "~/shared/ui/card";
import { Input } from "~/shared/ui/input";
import { Label } from "~/shared/ui/label";

// Example usage
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Login</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <div>
        <Label htmlFor="email">Email</Label>
        <Input id="email" type="email" />
      </div>
      <Button type="submit">Sign In</Button>
    </div>
  </CardContent>
</Card>;
```

## Adding New Components

To add a new shadcn/ui component:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component-name]
```

This will copy the component into this directory where it can be customized.

## Customization

All components use CSS variables for theming, defined in `src/styles.css`. The theme automatically adjusts for light/dark mode based on the `ThemeProvider` context.

## Documentation

For detailed component documentation and examples, see:

- [shadcn/ui Components](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components)
- [Component Guide](../../../docs/quadball-plan/ui-flows/component-guide.md)

# TanStack Router Params Type Error Investigation

## Summary

The TypeScript error with Link component params is NOT a known TanStack limitation as initially documented. After thorough investigation, the issue stems from how TanStack Router's type system expects params to be passed.

## Error Message

```
Type '{ teamId: string; }' is not assignable to type 'true | ParamsReducerFn<AnyRouter, "PATH", string, string | undefined>'.
```

## Root Cause

The Link component's `params` prop expects one of these types:

1. `true` - Use current params as-is
2. `ParamsReducer<TRouter, 'PATH', TFrom, TTo>` - Which can be:
   - A plain object of type `Expand<ResolveRelativeToParams<TRouter, TParamVariant, TFrom, TTo>>`
   - A function `ParamsReducerFn` that takes current params and returns new params

The type system is unable to infer that `{ teamId: string }` matches the expected plain object type because:

1. The generic types `TFrom` and `TTo` are not being properly constrained
2. The router type inference chain is complex and relies on string literal types for routes
3. The SafeLink wrapper component passes through props without preserving the literal types

## Type Definitions Location

From `@tanstack/router-core/dist/esm/link.d.ts`:

```typescript
// Line 118-119
export type ParamsReducerFn<
  in out TRouter extends AnyRouter,
  in out TParamVariant extends ParamVariant,
  in out TFrom,
  in out TTo,
> = (
  current: Expand<ResolveFromParams<TRouter, TParamVariant, TFrom>>,
) => Expand<ResolveRelativeToParams<TRouter, TParamVariant, TFrom, TTo>>;

type ParamsReducer<
  TRouter extends AnyRouter,
  TParamVariant extends ParamVariant,
  TFrom,
  TTo,
> =
  | Expand<ResolveRelativeToParams<TRouter, TParamVariant, TFrom, TTo>>
  | (ParamsReducerFn<TRouter, TParamVariant, TFrom, TTo> & {});

// Line 133-134
export interface MakeOptionalPathParams<
  in out TRouter extends AnyRouter,
  in out TFrom,
  in out TTo,
> {
  params?: true | (ParamsReducer<TRouter, "PATH", TFrom, TTo> & {});
}
```

## Affected Files

### Using SafeLink Component

- `src/routes/dashboard/teams/$teamId.tsx` (line 214)
- `src/routes/dashboard/teams/index.tsx` (lines 130, 138)

### SafeLink Component Implementation

- `src/components/ui/SafeLink.tsx`
  - Wraps TanStack Router's Link component
  - Uses `React.ComponentProps<typeof Link>` which may lose type inference

## The Real Issue

The SafeLink component's type definition:

```typescript
type Props = React.ComponentProps<typeof Link>;
```

This extracts props from the Link component but loses the generic type parameters that allow proper type inference for route params. The Link component relies on literal string types for `TFrom` and `TTo` to properly type the params.

## Investigation Results

After testing, the issue persists even when using TanStack Router's Link component directly. This rules out SafeLink as the cause.

Test results:

- Direct Link with object params: **Same error**
- Direct Link with function params: **Type '{ teamId: string; }' is not assignable to type 'never'**
- SafeLink has the same errors as direct Link usage

## Real Root Cause

The TypeScript compiler is unable to properly infer that the route "/dashboard/teams/$teamId" has a param named "teamId". The error message shows it's trying to match against:

- `ParamsReducerFn<AnyRouter, "PATH", string, "/dashboard/teams/$teamId">`

Note that it's using `AnyRouter` instead of the properly registered router type. This suggests the type inference chain is broken somewhere.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Fix the Type Registration

The issue might be in how the router types are registered. The `declare module` might not be properly connecting the router instance to the type system.

### Option 2: Use Type Assertion (Current Workaround)

Continue using type assertions but document why:

```typescript
// Type assertion needed due to TanStack Router type inference issue
// The router cannot infer param types from dynamic routes
<Link to="/dashboard/teams/$teamId" params={{ teamId } as any}>
```

### Option 3: Create a Typed Link Helper

Create a helper that properly types the params:

```typescript
function createTypedLink<TPath extends keyof FileRoutesByFullPath>(
  path: TPath,
  params: ExtractRouteParams<TPath>
) {
  return { to: path, params };
}

// Usage
<Link {...createTypedLink("/dashboard/teams/$teamId", { teamId })} />
```

## Verification Completed

1. ✅ Using Link directly does NOT resolve the type error
2. ✅ Function form also fails with type errors
3. ✅ Issue is NOT specific to SafeLink wrapper

## Final Solution

Created a properly typed Link component (`TypedLink`) that preserves the generic type parameters needed for proper type inference.

### Key Differences from SafeLink:

1. **Explicit Generic Parameters**: TypedLink explicitly defines all generic parameters that Link expects
2. **RegisteredRouter Type**: Uses `RegisteredRouter` type instead of extracting props which loses type information
3. **Proper Type Preservation**: The generic parameters flow through to the underlying Link component

### Implementation:

```typescript
export function TypedLink<
  TFrom extends string = string,
  TTo extends string | undefined = ".",
  TMaskFrom extends string = TFrom,
  TMaskTo extends string = "."
>(
  props: LinkComponentProps<"a", RegisteredRouter, TFrom, TTo, TMaskFrom, TMaskTo>
) {
  // WebKit handling logic...
  return <Link {...props} />;
}
```

### Results:

✅ Type checking passes without any errors
✅ No need for `as any` or `@ts-expect-error`
✅ Params are properly typed based on route definitions
✅ Maintains Safari/WebKit compatibility from SafeLink

### Usage:

```typescript
// Simple param passing - types are inferred correctly
<Link to="/dashboard/teams/$teamId" params={{ teamId: team.id }}>
  View Team
</Link>

// Within same param context - use params={true}
<Link to="./members" params={true}>
  Manage Members
</Link>
```

description: Creating new features and documentation
alwaysApply: false
---
When creating new features:
1. Read and update /docs/quadball-plan/ as appropriate
2. After implementing significant changes to code in src/lib/, run `pnpm docs:reference` to update API documentation
3. If updating database schema, run `pnpm docs:erd` to regenerate ERD diagrams
4. Use `pnpm docs:all` to update all automated documentation

Documentation automation:
- TypeDoc generates API reference docs from src/lib/* code and comments
- ERD generator creates visual database diagrams from mermaid definitions in docs/quadball-plan/database/schema-overview.md
- Generated docs go to docs/reference/ (gitignored except ERD images)

  - `setup.ts` - Test environment setup
  - `utils.tsx` - Test utilities
  - `mocks/` - Mock data and functions

## Key Conventions

### File Naming

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`)
- **Utilities**: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
- **Types**: PascalCase with `.types.ts` suffix
- **Tests**: `*.test.tsx` or `*.spec.tsx`

### Import Paths

- Use `~/` alias for src directory imports
- Prefer absolute imports over relative for better maintainability
- Group imports: external libraries, internal modules, relative imports

### Component Organization

- Co-locate related files (component, styles, tests)
- Use index files for clean exports
- Separate concerns: UI components vs. business logic

### Database Schema

- Use snake_case for database columns (configured in Drizzle)
- Schema files in `src/db/schema/`
- Export all schemas from `src/db/schema/index.ts`

### Route Structure

- Follow TanStack Router file-based routing
- API routes in `src/routes/api/`
- Page components in route files
- Use route groups for organization

### Environment Configuration

- Server-only variables in `env.server.ts`
- Client-safe variables (VITE\_ prefix) in `env.client.ts`
- Validate all environment variables with Zod schemas

### Testing Structure

- Unit tests co-located with components
- Integration tests in `__tests__` directories
- Test utilities in `src/tests/`
- Mock data centralized in `src/tests/mocks/`
- Use Vitest + React Testing Library pattern
- Test user behavior, not implementation details

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development Process

1. **Read project docs** in `docs/quadball-plan/` for context
2. **Update documentation** when implementing new features
3. **Follow development backlog** priorities in `docs/development-backlog.md`
4. **Run documentation automation** after significant changes:
   - `pnpm docs:reference` after `src/lib/` changes
   - `pnpm docs:erd` after database schema updates
   - `pnpm docs:all` for complete documentation update

### Database Development

- **Connection types**: Use `db()` by default, `pooledDb()` for API routes, `unpooledDb()` for migrations
- **Schema location**: `src/db/schema/` with exports from `index.ts`
- **Migration workflow**: `pnpm db:generate` → `pnpm db:migrate`
- **Connection priority**: Custom overrides → Netlify auto → DATABASE_URL fallback

### Security Implementation

- **Rate limiting**: Apply to auth endpoints (5/15min) and API routes (100/15min)
- **Password validation**: 8+ chars with mixed requirements and strength meter
- **Headers**: Automatic via Netlify Edge Functions with CSP nonces
- **Cookies**: Secure configuration in production (HTTPS-only, HttpOnly, SameSite)

### Form Development Pattern

- **Centralized hook**: Use `useAppForm` from `src/lib/form.ts`
- **Type inference**: Provide `defaultValues`, avoid explicit generics
- **Reusable components**: `ValidatedInput`, `ValidatedSelect` etc.
- **Validation**: Zod schemas in `validators` option
- **Construction**: `form.AppField` with render props

### Development Servers

- **Vite dev**: `pnpm dev` (port 5173) - basic development, the usual to use
- **Netlify dev**: `netlify dev` (port 8888) - with edge functions
- **OAuth setup**: Configure redirect URLs for local development environment

2. **Service Wrapper**:
   - Create typed wrapper in `src/lib/[service-name]/`
   - Include error handling and logging
   - Write unit tests for critical paths

3. **Webhook Handlers**:
   - Always validate signatures
   - Use database transactions
   - Log all events for debugging

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update this file with configuration steps
   - Add integration guide if complex
   - Include troubleshooting section

### Security Best Practices

1. **API Keys**: Never commit to repository
2. **Webhooks**: Always validate signatures
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement for all external calls
4. **Error Handling**: Never expose internal errors to users
5. **Logging**: Track all external API interactions

## Monitoring

All integrations should report to application monitoring:

```typescript
// Example integration wrapper
async function callExternalAPI() {
  const start = Date.now();
  try {
    const result = await externalAPI.call();
    metrics.record("external_api.success", Date.now() - start);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    metrics.record("external_api.error", Date.now() - start);
    logger.error("External API failed", { error });
    throw new ExternalServiceError("Service temporarily unavailable");
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Square Payments

- **Webhook not received**: Check signature key configuration
- **Payment failed**: Review Square dashboard for details
- **Sandbox testing**: Use test card numbers from Square docs

### Email Delivery

- **Emails not sending**: Verify API key and sender domain
- **Spam folder**: Check SPF/DKIM records
- **Rate limits**: Implement queuing for bulk sends

### Media Upload

- **Upload fails**: Check file size limits
- **Transformation errors**: Verify format support
- **Slow loading**: Enable CDN caching

We use shadcn/ui for foundational components. See `src/shared/ui/README.md` for the list of available base components.

## Project-Specific Components

### ValidatedInput

Location: `src/components/form-fields/ValidatedInput.tsx`

A wrapper around the base Input component that adds validation feedback:

```tsx
<ValidatedInput label="Email" name="email" type="email" error={errors.email} required />
```

**Features**:

- Integrated error display
- Required field indicators
- Accessible error announcements
- Consistent spacing

### FormSubmitButton

Location: `src/components/form-fields/FormSubmitButton.tsx`

Smart submit button with loading states:

```tsx
<FormSubmitButton isLoading={mutation.isPending} loadingText="Creating team...">
  Create Team
</FormSubmitButton>
```

**Features**:

- Loading spinner animation
- Disabled state during submission
- Customizable loading text
- Prevents double-submission

### ThemeToggle

Location: `src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx`

Theme switcher supporting light/dark/system modes:

```tsx
<ThemeToggle />
```

**Features**:

- Persists preference to localStorage
- Respects system preference
- Smooth transitions
- Accessible keyboard navigation

## Component Patterns

### Form Components

All forms follow consistent patterns:

```tsx
// Example form structure
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  <div className="space-y-4">
    <ValidatedInput label="Team Name" name="name" error={errors.name} required />

    <ValidatedInput
      label="Team Slug"
      name="slug"
      error={errors.slug}
      helpText="URL-friendly identifier"
    />

    <FormSubmitButton isLoading={isSubmitting}>Create Team</FormSubmitButton>
  </div>
</form>
```

### Loading States

Consistent loading patterns across the app:

```tsx
// Skeleton loading
if (isLoading) {
  return <TeamCardSkeleton />;
}

// Inline loading
{
  isPending ? (
    <Loader2 className="h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />
  ) : (
    <Check className="h-4 w-4" />
  );
}
```

### Error States

User-friendly error displays:

```tsx
// Form field errors
<ValidatedInput error="Email is required" />

// Page-level errors
<Alert variant="destructive">
  <AlertCircle className="h-4 w-4" />
  <AlertDescription>{error.message}</AlertDescription>
</Alert>
```

## Styling Conventions

### Tailwind Classes

We use Tailwind utility classes with consistent patterns:

```tsx
// Spacing
className = "space-y-4"; // Vertical spacing
className = "gap-4"; // Grid/flex gap

// Cards and containers
className = "rounded-lg border bg-card p-6";

// Interactive elements
className = "hover:bg-accent focus:outline-none focus:ring-2";

// Text styles
className = "text-sm text-muted-foreground";
```

### Component Variants

Using the `class-variance-authority` pattern from shadcn/ui:

```tsx
const buttonVariants = cva(
  "inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md text-sm font-medium",
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: "bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90",
        outline: "border border-input hover:bg-accent",
      },
      size: {
        sm: "h-9 px-3",
        md: "h-10 px-4",
        lg: "h-11 px-8",
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: "default",
      size: "md",
    },
  },
);
```

## Accessibility

### Required Patterns

1. **Semantic HTML**: Use proper elements (`button`, `nav`, `main`)
2. **ARIA Labels**: Add when visual context isn't enough
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements keyboard accessible
4. **Focus Indicators**: Visible focus rings on all interactive elements
5. **Error Announcements**: Screen reader friendly error messages

### Example Implementation

```tsx
<Button
  aria-label="Delete team"
  aria-describedby="delete-warning"
>
  <Trash2 className="h-4 w-4" />
</Button>
<span id="delete-warning" className="sr-only">
  This action cannot be undone
</span>
```

## Future Components

Consider using GitHub Discussions or a project board to track planned components:

- **DataTable**: Sortable, filterable tables
- **DatePicker**: Accessible date selection
- **FileUpload**: Drag-and-drop uploads
- **RichTextEditor**: For announcements
- **StatsCard**: Animated statistics

## Development Guidelines

### Creating New Components

1. **Check existing components** first - don't recreate what exists
2. **Start with shadcn/ui** - Use as foundation when possible
3. **Follow naming conventions** - PascalCase for components
4. **Include TypeScript types** - Full type safety required
5. **Test accessibility** - Use screen reader and keyboard

## Project Brief: Quadball Canada Registration and Events Website

### Project Overview

Quadball Canada needs a comprehensive, easy-to-use platform for managing event registrations, player memberships, team profiles, and administrative tasks. This platform should simplify processes for players, teams, and admins, with customizable features and streamlined management.

### User Roles and Privileges

#### Organization Admins

- **Global Admins**: Full permissions across the entire platform, including creating and managing products, assigning user tags (coach, team lead, national team, standing team), editing player profiles (including suspensions), and customizing website appearance (colors, backgrounds).
- **Event Coordinators**: Admin privileges limited strictly to their specific event(s), such as editing rosters, managing payment statuses, and sending reminders.

#### Team Logins

- Team registration (annual membership).
- View and manage team members, assign coaches and team leads.
- Purchase memberships for players individually or allow players to register/pay independently.
- View player history, event participation, and edit jersey numbers.
- Generate custom reports limited to their own team members.

#### Individual Logins

- Create and manage personal profiles including:
  - Pronouns, pronunciation guide for names, jersey number (editable).
  - Gender, date of birth, emergency contact, demographic information.

- Register and pay for events and memberships.
- View registered events and payment history.

### Event Management Features

- Create event pages with:
  - Date, location, information packages.
  - Registration deadlines (with automated reminders).

- Duplicate existing events easily for streamlined event setup.
- Event templates pre-filled with specific common information, allowing for quicker setup by just filling in the remaining details.
- Registration forms customizable per event.
- Exportable email lists segmented by registrants, team leads, referees, etc.
- Membership validation (auto-add required memberships during registration).
- Automatic generation of tournament brackets/schedules from templates.
- Fillable information packages (auto-populated fields).
- Event coordinator access to rosters and payment status prior to event lock.
- Volunteer registration options for event-specific roles.
- Direct integration with external resources (e.g., QDrill for national team practices).
- Flexible pricing based on user tags (e.g., standing team free entry, others \$15).
- Post-event surveys sent automatically.
- Live score updates and event media uploads (photos and video links).

### Export and Reporting Features

- Targeted messaging/email lists:
  - By event, membership type, team, roles (coach, team lead), gender, age, experience level.

- Budget reports clearly separating event registration fees from memberships and other products, even if purchased together.
- Detailed purchase reports including purchaser names and items bought.
- Customizable reporting feature allowing admins and team leads (limited to their teams) to create tailored reports based on specific data points (e.g., referee registrations, age-specific participation).
- Flexible export options allowing selection of specific data fields for event registration exports:
  - Basic pre-selection includes name, birthday, gender, and emergency contact information.
  - Advanced pre-selection includes all available data such as transaction ID, amount paid, membership status, and team registration.

### Membership Renewal and Feedback

- Automated reminders sent to members at the end of their membership year to encourage renewal for the next season.
- Members who do not renew are prompted to complete a brief survey regarding their reasons for not returning.

### Landing Page Essentials

- Clear display of upcoming events.
- Easy access to organizational policies.
- Comprehensive FAQ section.

### Payment Integration

- Accept payments through Square or similar third-party service.
- Secure and user-friendly checkout process.
- Payments must be completed fully at checkout—no installments or partial payments.

### Special Features

- Team transfer requests managed through an approval workflow involving team leads and admins (workflow details to be defined).
- Duplicate player registrations prompt users with existing profile details and assist with logging into their existing account, with admins having the ability to trigger a "reset password" email.

### Notifications

- Include in-platform notifications for important actions or alerts, in addition to email notifications.

### Integrations

- Social media feeds integrated directly into event or landing pages.
- Google Forms integration for collecting additional information or conducting surveys.
- Google Calendar integration for automated event calendar invites.

### Security and Privacy

- All personal and sensitive data storage must comply strictly with Canadian privacy laws (PIPEDA or applicable provincial laws).
- Secure handling of sensitive user information, including emergency contacts and demographics.

### Reporting and Analytics

- Analytics dashboard showing registration trends, event attendance, demographics.
- Custom reporting feature accessible to global admins and team leads (team-specific).

### Goals

- User-friendly experience for admins, teams, and players.
- Comprehensive functionality to streamline administrative tasks.
- Customizable features ensuring flexibility to meet organizational needs.

# AGENTS.md - Coding Agent Guidelines for Solstice

## Build/Lint/Test Commands

- `pnpm dev` - Start Vite dev server (port 5173, default to use)
- `netlify dev` - Start with edge functions (port 8888)
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint
- `pnpm check-types` - TypeScript type checking
- `pnpm format` - Format with Prettier
- `pnpm test` - Run all tests
- `pnpm test path/to/file.test.tsx` - Run single test file
- `pnpm test -t "test name"` - Run tests matching pattern
- `pnpm test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode

## Code Style Guidelines

- **Imports**: Use `~/` alias for src imports, organize with prettier-plugin-organize-imports
- **Formatting**: 2 spaces, semicolons, double quotes, trailing commas, 90 char line width
- **Types**: Strict TypeScript, avoid `any`, use type inference where possible
- **Components**: Function components only, use shadcn/ui from `~/shared/ui/`
- **Naming**: PascalCase components, camelCase functions/variables, kebab-case files
- **Error Handling**: Use try-catch with proper error types, display user-friendly messages
- **Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library, mock external deps, test user behavior not implementation
- **Architecture**: Features in `src/features/`, shared code in `src/shared/`, thin route files

## Important Notes

- Read Better Auth docs at https://www.better-auth.com/llms.txt when working with auth
- Always run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check-types` before completing tasks

## TanStack Start Server Functions

### Key Concept: Only handler code is extracted from client bundle

When using server functions, **only code inside the `handler()` is removed from the client bundle**. Top-level imports remain in the client bundle and will execute in the browser.

### Patterns for Server-Only Modules

If a module accesses server-only resources (env vars, Node.js APIs, database), use one of these patterns:

**Pattern 1: `serverOnly()` helper (recommended for reusability)**

```typescript
import { serverOnly } from "@tanstack/react-start";

const getPaymentService = serverOnly(async () => {
  const { paymentService } = await import("~/lib/payments/service");
  return paymentService;
});

export const processPayment = createServerFn().handler(async ({ data }) => {
  const paymentService = await getPaymentService();
  return paymentService.process(data);
});
```

**Pattern 2: Dynamic import inside handler (quick one-off)**

```typescript
export const processPayment = createServerFn().handler(async ({ data }) => {
  const { paymentService } = await import("~/lib/payments/service");
  return paymentService.process(data);
});
```

### Why This Matters

❌ **This will crash in the browser:**

```typescript
import { db } from "~/db"; // Uses process.env.DATABASE_URL

export const getUsers = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
  return db.select().from(users); // db import pollutes client bundle
});
```

✅ **This works correctly:**

```typescript
const getDb = serverOnly(async () => {
  const { db } = await import("~/db");
  return db;
});

export const getUsers = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
  const db = await getDb();
  return db.select().from(users);
});
```

# Server Functions Guide

Server functions in TanStack Start provide type-safe communication between client and server code. They are the primary way to implement backend logic in this project.

## Overview

Server functions are wrapped with `serverOnly()` to ensure they only run on the server. They have full access to:

- Database operations via Drizzle ORM
- Authentication state via Better Auth
- External APIs and services
- Server-side environment variables

## When to Use What

| Use Case        | Solution                           | Example             |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Data fetching   | Server function in `.queries.ts`   | `getProfile()`      |
| Data mutation   | Server function in `.mutations.ts` | `updateProfile()`   |
| Auth logic      | Better Auth utilities              | `auth.getSession()` |
| Edge middleware | Netlify Edge Functions             | Security headers    |
| Page data       | Route loaders                      | Initial page data   |

## Creating a Server Function

### Step 1: Create a Server Function File

Server functions should be organized in feature directories with naming conventions:

- `.queries.ts` - For data fetching operations
- `.mutations.ts` - For data modification operations

```typescript
// src/features/auth/auth.queries.ts
import { serverOnly } from "@tanstack/start";
import { db } from "~/db";
import { users } from "~/db/schema";
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";
import { getAuthFromHeaders } from "~/lib/auth/utils";

export const getCurrentUser = serverOnly(async () => {
  const { user } = await getAuthFromHeaders();

  if (!user) {
    throw new Error("Not authenticated");
  }

  const dbUser = await db.query.users.findFirst({
    where: eq(users.id, user.id),
  });

  if (!dbUser) {
    throw new Error("User not found");
  }

  return dbUser;
});
```

### Step 2: Handle Authentication & Authorization

Use the auth context to check permissions:

```typescript
// src/features/auth/auth.mutations.ts
import { serverOnly } from "@tanstack/start";
import { getAuthFromHeaders } from "~/lib/auth/utils";
import { db } from "~/db";
import { users } from "~/db/schema";
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";

export const updateProfile = serverOnly(async (data: UpdateProfileInput) => {
  // Get current user
  const { user } = await getAuthFromHeaders();
  if (!user) {
    throw new Error("Unauthorized");
  }

  // Update profile
  const [updated] = await db
    .update(users)
    .set({
      name: data.name,
      updatedAt: new Date(),
    })
    .where(eq(users.id, user.id))
    .returning();

  return updated;
});
```

### Step 3: Implement Error Handling

Always handle errors appropriately:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const updateProfileSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1).max(100),
});

export const updateProfile = serverOnly(async (data: unknown) => {
  try {
    // Validate input
    const validated = updateProfileSchema.parse(data);

    // Get current user
    const { user } = await getAuthFromHeaders();
    if (!user) {
      throw new Error("Unauthorized");
    }

    // Update profile
    const [updated] = await db
      .update(users)
      .set({
        name: validated.name,
        updatedAt: new Date(),
      })
      .where(eq(users.id, user.id))
      .returning();

    return updated;
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof z.ZodError) {
      throw new Error("Invalid input: " + error.message);
    }

    // Log unexpected errors
    console.error("Update profile error:", error);
    throw new Error("Failed to update profile");
  }
});
```

### Step 4: Call from Client Components

Use TanStack Query to call server functions:

```tsx
// src/routes/dashboard/profile.tsx
import { useMutation, useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { getCurrentUser, updateProfile } from "~/features/auth/auth.queries";

export default function ProfilePage() {
  // Fetch data
  const { data: user, isLoading } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["currentUser"],
    queryFn: getCurrentUser,
  });

  // Update mutation
  const updateMutation = useMutation({
    mutationFn: updateProfile,
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ["currentUser"] });
    },
  });

  // Use in component...
}
```

## Code Search Paths

To find existing server functions in the codebase:

```bash
# Find all query files
find src/features -name "*.queries.ts"

# Find all mutation files
find src/features -name "*.mutations.ts"

# Search for server functions
grep -r "serverOnly" src/features
```

## Best Practices

### 1. File Organization

```
src/features/
└── auth/
    ├── auth.queries.ts      # getCurrentUser, getProfile
    └── auth.mutations.ts    # updateProfile, changePassword
```

### 2. Type Safety

Always define input and output types:

```typescript
// src/features/auth/auth.types.ts
export interface UpdateProfileInput {
  name?: string;
  pronouns?: string;
  birthDate?: string;
}

export interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string | null;
  createdAt: Date;
}

// Use in server function
export const updateProfile = serverOnly(
  async (input: UpdateProfileInput): Promise<UserProfile> => {
    // Implementation...
  },
);
```

### 3. Authentication Patterns

Create reusable auth utilities:

```typescript
// src/lib/auth/utils.ts
export async function requireAuth() {
  const { user } = await getAuthFromHeaders();
  if (!user) {
    throw new Error("Unauthorized");
  }
  return user;
}

// Use in server functions
export const myProtectedFunction = serverOnly(async () => {
  const user = await requireAuth();
  // User is guaranteed to be authenticated
});
```

### 4. Database Transactions

Use transactions for multi-step operations:

```typescript
export const deleteAccount = serverOnly(async () => {
  const user = await requireAuth();

  return await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
    // Delete user sessions
    await tx.delete(sessions).where(eq(sessions.userId, user.id));

    // Delete user accounts
    await tx.delete(accounts).where(eq(accounts.userId, user.id));

    // Delete user
    await tx.delete(users).where(eq(users.id, user.id));

    // Log the deletion
    console.log(`Deleted user account: ${user.id}`);
  });
});
```

### 5. Caching Strategy

Use React Query's caching effectively:

```typescript
// Define stable query keys
export const authKeys = {
  all: ["auth"] as const,
  user: () => [...authKeys.all, "user"] as const,
  session: () => [...authKeys.all, "session"] as const,
  profile: (id: string) => [...authKeys.all, "profile", id] as const,
};

// Use in components
const { data } = useQuery({
  queryKey: authKeys.user(),
  queryFn: getCurrentUser,
  staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
});
```

## Common Patterns

### Authentication Check

```typescript
export const getAuthStatus = serverOnly(async () => {
  const { user } = await getAuthFromHeaders();

  return {
    isAuthenticated: !!user,
    user: user || null,
  };
});
```

### Profile Update

```typescript
export const updateUserPreferences = serverOnly(async (preferences: UserPreferences) => {
  const user = await requireAuth();

  const [updated] = await db
    .update(users)
    .set({
      preferences: preferences,
      updatedAt: new Date(),
    })
    .where(eq(users.id, user.id))
    .returning();

  return updated;
});
```

### Session Management

```typescript
export const invalidateAllSessions = serverOnly(async () => {
  const user = await requireAuth();

  // Delete all sessions for user
  await db.delete(sessions).where(eq(sessions.userId, user.id));

  return { success: true };
});
```

## Testing Server Functions

Create unit tests for server functions:

```typescript
// src/features/auth/__tests__/auth.queries.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach } from "vitest";
import { getCurrentUser } from "../auth.queries";
import { mockAuth } from "~/tests/mocks/auth";

describe("getCurrentUser", () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    mockAuth({ id: "user-1", email: "test@example.com" });
  });

  it("returns current user when authenticated", async () => {
    const user = await getCurrentUser();

    expect(user).toMatchObject({
      id: "user-1",
      email: "test@example.com",
    });
  });

  it("throws error when not authenticated", async () => {
    mockAuth(null);

    await expect(getCurrentUser()).rejects.toThrow("Not authenticated");
  });
});
```

## Migration from REST

If migrating from REST endpoints, map them to server functions:

| REST Endpoint            | Server Function       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| GET /api/auth/me         | `getCurrentUser()`    |
| PUT /api/auth/profile    | `updateProfile(data)` |
| POST /api/auth/logout    | `logout()`            |
| DELETE /api/auth/account | `deleteAccount()`     |

The key difference is that server functions are called directly from React components with full type safety, rather than using fetch() with manual type casting.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Technology Choices

1. **[TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start)** - Full-stack React framework with type-safe server functions
2. **[Better Auth](https://better-auth.com)** - Modern authentication built for edge/serverless
3. **[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team)** - Type-safe SQL with excellent DX
4. **[Neon PostgreSQL](https://neon.tech)** - Serverless Postgres with connection pooling
5. **[React Query](https://tanstack.com/query)** - Server state management
6. **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)** + [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)\*\* - Styling system

## Core Principles

### 1. Feature-Based Organization

```
src/features/
├── auth/           # ✅ Implemented
├── teams/          # 🚧 In Progress
├── events/         # ⏳ Planned
├── payments/       # ⏳ Planned
└── analytics/      # ⏳ Planned
```

### 2. Type Safety Everywhere

From database to UI, types flow through the entire stack:

```typescript
// Database schema (source of truth)
export const users = pgTable("users", {
  id: text("id").primaryKey(),
  email: text("email").notNull().unique(),
  name: text("name"),
});

// Automatically inferred types
type User = InferSelectModel<typeof users>;

// Type-safe server function
export const getUser = serverOnly(async (id: string): Promise<User> => {
  return await db.query.users.findFirst({
    where: eq(users.id, id),
  });
});

// Type-safe client usage
const { data: user } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["user", id],
  queryFn: () => getUser(id),
});
```

### 3. Security First

- Authentication via Better Auth with session management
- Server functions ensure code never runs on client
- Environment variables validated at build time
- CSP headers and security middleware

### 4. Performance Optimization

- Server-side rendering for fast initial loads
- Intelligent caching with React Query
- Route-based code splitting
- Edge deployment via Netlify

## Data Flow

### User Action Example

```
User clicks "Login" → Form submission → Server function validates
    ↓                      ↓                    ↓
React component     TanStack Query      Better Auth verifies
    ↓                      ↓                    ↓
Loading state      Updates cache         Creates session
    ↓                      ↓                    ↓
Redirect           UI updates            Database record
```

## Deployment

### Local Development

- **Vite** - Fast HMR and builds
- **Netlify Dev** - Simulates edge functions
- **Docker** (optional) - PostgreSQL container

### Production

- **Netlify** - Automatic Git deployments
- **Neon** - Managed PostgreSQL

# Database Schema & Relationships

## Overview

The Quadball Canada platform uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations. The schema is designed for extensibility, audit trails, and performance at scale.

> ⚠️ **Current vs Future**: Only the Better Auth tables (users, sessions, accounts) are currently implemented. All other tables shown below are **planned future entities**.

## Entity Relationship Diagram

### Currently Implemented (Better Auth)

![Database ERD](../../reference/database/schema-erd.svg)

```mermaid
erDiagram
    users ||--o{ sessions : "authenticates"
    users ||--o{ accounts : "connects"

    users {
        string id PK
        string email UK
        string emailVerified
        string name
        string image
        timestamp createdAt
        timestamp updatedAt
    }

    sessions {
        string id PK
        string userId FK
        timestamp expiresAt
        string token
        timestamp createdAt
        timestamp updatedAt
    }

    accounts {
        string id PK
        string userId FK
        string providerId
        string providerUserId
        string accessToken
        string refreshToken
        timestamp createdAt
        timestamp updatedAt
    }
```

### Future Entities (Planned)

```mermaid
erDiagram
    %% Future RBAC System
    users ||--o{ user_roles : "will have"
    users ||--o{ user_tags : "will have"

    %% Future Membership System
    users ||--o{ memberships : "will purchase"
    membership_types ||--o{ memberships : "will define"

    %% Future Team System
    users ||--o{ team_members : "will join"
    teams ||--o{ team_members : "will have"
    teams ||--o| teams : "may affiliate"

    %% Future Event System
    users ||--o{ event_registrations : "will register"
    teams ||--o{ event_registrations : "will enter"
    events ||--o{ event_registrations : "will accept"
    events ||--o{ event_games : "will schedule"
    teams ||--o{ event_games : "will play"

    %% Future Payment System
    users ||--o{ payments : "will make"
    payments ||--o{ payment_items : "will contain"

    %% Future Audit System
    users ||--o{ audit_logs : "will generate"
    users ||--o{ notifications : "will receive"
```

## Schema Design Principles

These principles guide both current and future development:

### 1. Extensibility via JSONB

Strategic use of JSONB fields for flexibility:

```typescript
// Future user privacy settings
privacySettings: {
  showEmail: boolean;
  showPhone: boolean;
  showBirthYear: boolean;
}

// Future event custom fields
customFields: {
  dietaryRestrictions?: string;
  accommodationNeeds?: string;
  teamPreference?: string;
}
```

### 2. Audit Trail

Every financial transaction and sensitive operation will be logged:

```typescript
// Future payment metadata
metadata: {
  ip_address: string;
  user_agent: string;
  square_receipt_url: string;
  refund_reason?: string;
}
```

### 3. Soft Deletes

Critical data will never be hard deleted:

```typescript
// Status fields instead of deletion
status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'cancelled' | 'expired'

// Temporal data
deactivatedAt?: Date;
deactivatedBy?: string;
```

### 4. Optimistic Concurrency

Version fields to prevent race conditions:

```typescript
// Version tracking
version: number; // Incremented on update
updatedAt: Date; // Last modification time
```

## Performance Considerations

### Current Indexes

```sql
-- User lookups (implemented)
users(email) -- Login
users(id) -- Primary key

-- Session lookups (implemented)
sessions(userId) -- User sessions
sessions(token) -- Token validation
```

### Future Indexes (When Tables Are Added)

```sql
-- Team queries
team_members(team_id, status) -- Active roster
team_members(user_id) WHERE status = 'active' -- User's team

-- Event queries
events(slug) -- URL lookups
events(start_date, status) -- Upcoming events
event_registrations(event_id, status) -- Participant lists

-- Payment queries
payments(user_id, created_at) -- User history
payments(provider_payment_id) -- Webhook lookups
```

## Data Integrity

### Current Constraints

```sql
-- Implemented in Better Auth schema
UNIQUE (email) ON users
FOREIGN KEY (userId) REFERENCES users(id) ON sessions
FOREIGN KEY (userId) REFERENCES users(id) ON accounts
```

### Future Constraints

```sql
-- One active team per user
UNIQUE (user_id) WHERE status = 'active' ON team_members

-- Unique slugs
UNIQUE (slug) ON teams
UNIQUE (slug) ON events

-- Valid price ranges
CHECK (price_cents >= 0) ON membership_types
CHECK (fee_cents >= 0) ON events
```

## Migration Strategy

### Current State

- Better Auth tables created automatically
- User authentication fully functional

### Future Migrations

All schema changes will be managed through Drizzle:

```typescript
// Generate migration
pnpm db:generate

// Apply migration
pnpm db:push

// Migration naming convention
0001_add_user_profiles.sql
0002_add_rbac_tables.sql
0003_add_team_tables.sql
0004_add_event_system.sql
0005_add_payment_tables.sql
```

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

- Sessions expire automatically
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- OAuth tokens stored securely

### Future Security Features

#### Sensitive Data Encryption

Fields requiring special handling:

- `users.phone` - Will be encrypted at rest
- `users.emergencyContact` - Encrypted JSONB
- `payments.metadata` - Contains PII
- `audit_logs.ipAddress` - Privacy regulations

#### Row-Level Security

Future access control patterns:

```typescript
// Users see own data
function canViewUser(userId: string, targetId: string) {
  return userId === targetId || hasRole(userId, "global_admin");
}

// Team members see team data
function canViewTeam(userId: string, teamId: string) {
  return isTeamMember(userId, teamId) || hasRole(userId, "team_lead");
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Profile Extension** - Add profile fields to users table
2. **RBAC Implementation** - Create roles and permissions system
3. **Team System** - Teams and membership tables
4. **Event Management** - Events and registration system
5. **Payment Processing** - Square integration tables

The schema is designed to evolve incrementally while maintaining data integrity and performance.

# Rate Limiting Documentation

## Overview

The application uses **client-side rate limiting** with TanStack Pacer to protect against abuse and ensure fair usage. This approach prevents excessive requests before they're sent and provides immediate user feedback.

Rate limiting is applied at different levels:

1. **Authentication endpoints** - Stricter limits for sensitive operations
2. **API endpoints** - General limits for regular API calls
3. **Search operations** - Optimized for rapid queries
4. **Mutations** - Balanced limits for write operations

## Client-Side Rate Limiting

We use TanStack Pacer for client-side rate limiting. See [Rate Limiting with TanStack Pacer](./rate-limiting-with-pacer.md) for detailed documentation on:

- Using the `useRateLimitedServerFn` hook
- Rate limit presets and configuration
- Integration examples
- Best practices

## Configuration

Rate limits are configured in `src/lib/pacer/rate-limit-config.ts`:

```typescript
auth: {
  limit: 5,
  window: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  windowType: "fixed"
},
api: {
  limit: 100,
  window: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  windowType: "sliding"
},
search: {
  limit: 10,
  window: 10 * 1000, // 10 seconds
  windowType: "sliding"
},
mutation: {
  limit: 20,
  window: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  windowType: "fixed"
}
```

## How It Works

TanStack Pacer implements client-side rate limiting using:

- **Token bucket algorithm** for smooth request distribution
- **Local storage persistence** to maintain limits across page reloads
- **Immediate user feedback** via toast notifications

When the rate limit is exceeded, users see a toast message:

```
Too many requests. Please try again in X seconds.
```

## Implementation Details

### Using Rate Limiting

To add rate limiting to any server function call:

```typescript
import { useRateLimitedServerFn } from "~/lib/pacer";

// In your component
const rateLimitedCreateTeam = useRateLimitedServerFn(createTeam, { type: "mutation" });

// Use it like the original function
await rateLimitedCreateTeam({ data: teamData });
```

### Rate Limit Types

- **auth**: For authentication operations (login, signup, password reset)
- **api**: For general API calls
- **search**: For search operations with debouncing
- **mutation**: For data modifications

### Why Client-Side Only?

For serverless deployments (like Netlify), client-side rate limiting is more effective because:

1. **No shared state needed** between function invocations
2. **Immediate feedback** without network round-trips
3. **Reduced server load** by preventing requests entirely
4. **Better UX** with instant feedback

For additional protection, consider using:

- CDN-level rate limiting (Netlify, Cloudflare)
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules

## Testing

To test rate limiting in development:

1. Open your browser's developer console
2. Rapidly click a button that triggers a rate-limited server function
3. After hitting the limit, you should see a toast notification
4. Check local storage for `tanstack-pacer-*` entries to see stored limits

## Future Improvements

1. **Server-Side Validation**: Add server-side rate limiting for defense in depth
2. **User-based Limits**: Different limits for authenticated vs anonymous users
3. **Dynamic Limits**: Adjust limits based on user tier or subscription
4. **Analytics**: Track rate limit hits for monitoring abuse patterns
5. **Gradual Backoff**: Implement exponential backoff for repeated violations

# Solstice

[![CI](https://github.com/soleilheaney/solstice/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/soleilheaney/solstice/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/soleilheaney/solstice/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/soleilheaney/solstice)
[![Deploy Preview](https://github.com/soleilheaney/solstice/actions/workflows/deploy-preview.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/soleilheaney/solstice/actions/workflows/deploy-preview.yml)

## Sports Registration Platform

Solstice is a **modern web platform for managing memberships, teams, and events**. Built with [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) and deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) (React meta-framework)
- **Authentication**: [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/)
- **Database**: [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) with PostgreSQL
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Build Tool**: [Vite 7](https://vite.dev/)
- **Environment Validation**: [@t3-oss/env-core](https://env.t3.gg/) with [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- **Testing**: [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) with coverage
- **Deployment**: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v20.19.0+ (required for Vite 7)
- **pnpm**: v10+
- **PostgreSQL**: Database instance

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are validated at startup using Zod schemas. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Database (required)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/solstice

# Application (only required in development)
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Auth (required for production)
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key

# OAuth Providers (optional)
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# Feature Flags (optional)
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false
VITE_ENABLE_SENTRY=false
VITE_POSTHOG_KEY=your_posthog_key
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
```

**Environment Validation**: The app validates all environment variables at startup and provides clear error messages for missing or invalid values. See `src/lib/env.server.ts` and `src/lib/env.client.ts` for the validation schemas.

## Project Structure

- `src/routes/` - File-based routing (pages and API endpoints)
- `src/lib/auth/` - Better Auth configuration and functions
- `src/lib/db/` - Drizzle database setup and schemas
- `src/lib/env.server.ts` - Server-side environment validation
- `src/lib/env.client.ts` - Client-side environment validation
- `src/components/ui/` - shadcn/ui components
- `src/shared/` - Shared utilities and hooks

## Development

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Set up the database:**

   ```bash
   pnpm db push
   ```

3. **Generate auth schemas:**

   ```bash
   pnpm auth:generate
   ```

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Documentation

- **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)** - Guidelines for Claude Code AI assistant
- **[TanStack Start Best Practices](./docs/TANSTACK-START-BEST-PRACTICES.md)** - Server functions and type safety patterns
- **[Database Connections](./docs/database-connections.md)** - Connection pooling and usage patterns
- **[Project Brief](./docs/project-brief.md)** - High-level project overview
- **[Development Backlog](./docs/development-backlog.md)** - Feature implementation roadmap

## Available Scripts

### Development

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server with Netlify Dev
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm start` - Start production server

### Code Quality

- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint
- `pnpm check-types` - Type checking with TypeScript
- `pnpm format` - Format code with Prettier

### Testing

- `pnpm test` - Run tests with Vitest
- `pnpm test:ui` - Run tests with UI
- `pnpm test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage
- `pnpm test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode

### Database

- `pnpm db` - Run Drizzle Kit database commands
- `pnpm db:generate` - Generate database migrations
- `pnpm db:migrate` - Run database migrations
- `pnpm db:studio` - Open Drizzle Studio

### Utilities

- `pnpm auth:generate` - Generate auth schema from config
- `pnpm auth:secret` - Generate new auth secret
- `pnpm ui` - Add shadcn/ui components
- `pnpm deps` - Check for dependency updates with taze

## Dependency Management

Use [taze](https://github.com/antfu-collective/taze) to keep dependencies up to date:

```bash
# Check for updates interactively
pnpm dlx taze@latest --interactive --group

# Or use the shortcut
pnpm deps
```

Taze automatically detects your package manager and provides a safe, interactive way to update dependencies.

## Deployment

The application is automatically deployed to Netlify:

- **Production**: Pushes to `main` branch trigger production deployments
- **Preview**: Pull requests get automatic preview deployments

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows handle:

- **Continuous Integration**: Linting, type checking, and testing on Node.js 20
- **Deploy Previews**: Automatic Netlify preview deployments for pull requests
- **Code Coverage**: Test coverage reports uploaded to Codecov

### Required GitHub Secrets

Configure these secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string for CI tests
- `VITE_BASE_URL` - Base URL for the application (not needed in production - Netlify provides URL automatically)
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` - Auth secret key (generate with `pnpm auth:secret` locally)
- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` - Netlify authentication token
- `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` - Netlify site ID
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - Codecov upload token (optional)
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` - GitHub OAuth client ID
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` - GitHub OAuth client secret
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Google OAuth client secret

## Overview and Purpose

The Solstice platform streamlines sports league management – initially serving **Quadball Canada** (the national quadball governing body) and eventually adaptable to other sports organizations. The platform enables athletes, team leaders, and administrators to handle all essential activities in one place.

**Key Features:**

- **Member Registration & Management:** User accounts, profiles, waivers, and annual memberships
- **Team Setup & Roster Management:** Team creation, player invitations, and roster management
- **Event Creation & Registration:** Tournament/league management with team/individual registration
- **Payments & Finance:** Integration with a payment platform for membership and event fees
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Admin, Team Lead, and Player permission layers
- **Communication & Notifications:** Email confirmations and announcements
- **Future Extensibility:** Multi-organization, multi-sport capability

These are production-critical issues that should be addressed before new feature development:

### CRIT-1: Fix Payment Webhook Verification

| **Issue**      | Payment verification is mocked (line 160-165 in square-real.ts). This means we're not actually verifying payments in production.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| **Why urgent** | Current implementation accepts any payment as valid. Real money is at risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

- **Event Registration Payment Flow** - Integrate Square for event fees
- **E-transfer Payment Option** - Alternative payment method
- **Image Uploads** - Profile pictures and team logos via Cloudinary
- **Mobile PWA** - Offline support for event day check-ins
- **Public Content Pages** - About, Resources, Contact pages

---

## 📝 Cross-Cutting Notes

- **E2E Tests Required**: All new features must include E2E tests in `e2e/tests/`
- **Documentation**: Update relevant docs in `/docs/` with any schema or API changes
- **Type Safety**: Use Zod validation for all server functions (see CLAUDE.md)
- **Components**: Install new shadcn components to `src/components/ui` (per components.json)
- **Rate Limiting**: Use `useRateLimitedServerFn` from Pacer for client-side rate limiting

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Quick Reference

### Server Functions - Always Use Zod Validation

```typescript
// 1. Define schema
const mySchema = z.object({
  /* ... */
});

// 2. Use .validator(schema.parse)
export const myServerFn = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
  .validator(mySchema.parse)
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    /* ... */
  });
```

### Avoid @ts-expect-error

- NEVER use as first solution
- Try Zod validation first
- Create proper type definitions
- See [TanStack Start Best Practices](./docs/TANSTACK-START-BEST-PRACTICES.md) for details

## Development Commands

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server (Vite on port 5173, default to use)
- `netlify dev` - Start Netlify Dev server (port 8888, proxies Vite and includes edge functions)
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm start` - Start production server
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint
- `pnpm check-types` - Type checking with TypeScript
- `pnpm format` - Format code with Prettier
- `pnpm test` - Run Vitest tests
- `pnpm test:ui` - Run tests with UI
- `pnpm test:coverage` - Generate test coverage report
- `pnpm test:e2e` - Run Playwright E2E tests (automatically runs test:e2e:setup first)
- `pnpm test:e2e:ui` - Run E2E tests with UI mode
- `pnpm test:e2e:setup` - Seed database with E2E test data (automatically run before test:e2e)
- **Pre-commit E2E Testing**: Before committing changes to main, run Chromium E2E tests:
  ```bash
  pnpm test:e2e --reporter=html --output=e2e-test-results --workers 1 --project=chromium-unauthenticated --project=chromium-authenticated
  ```
  This ensures all browser tests pass before merging. Use `--workers 1` for consistent execution.
- `pnpm db` - Run Drizzle Kit database commands
- `pnpm auth:generate` - Generate auth schema from config
- `pnpm docs:reference` - Generate TypeDoc API documentation
- `pnpm docs:erd` - Generate database ERD diagrams from schema
- `pnpm docs:all` - Run all documentation generation

## Pre-Commit Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: The pre-commit hook automatically runs the following checks to ensure code quality:

1. **Lint-staged** - Runs on staged files only:
   - `eslint --fix` - Auto-fixes and checks ESLint rules
   - `prettier --write` - Formats code consistently
2. **Type checking** - `pnpm check-types` on entire codebase
3. **Tests** - `pnpm test --run` to ensure nothing is broken

All checks must pass before the commit is allowed. The pre-commit hook matches what GitHub Actions CI runs, ensuring no surprises after pushing.

## Architecture Overview

This is **Solstice**, a sports league management platform built with TanStack Start (full-stack React framework) and deployed to Netlify. The application uses:

- **TanStack Router** for file-based routing with type safety
- **Better Auth** for authentication (email/password + OAuth via GitHub/Google)
- **Drizzle ORM** with PostgreSQL for database operations
- **TanStack Query** for server state management and caching
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with shadcn/ui components

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Full-Stack React with TanStack Start**: The app uses TanStack Start's server-side rendering and API routes. Server-only code is isolated using `serverOnly()` wrapper.

**Database & Auth Integration**: Better Auth uses Drizzle adapter for seamless integration. Auth schemas are auto-generated with `pnpm auth:generate` command.

**File-Based Routing**: Routes follow TanStack Router conventions in `src/routes/`. Route tree is auto-generated in `routeTree.gen.ts`.

**Server State Management**: React Query handles caching and synchronization. User authentication state is cached at the root level and passed through context.

### Key Directories (Features-Based Architecture)

- `src/app/` - Application-level code (providers, router setup)
- `src/features/` - Feature modules organized by domain
  - `auth/` - Authentication feature (components, hooks, API, tests)
  - `profile/` - User profile management (components, server functions, guards)
  - `layouts/` - Admin and public layout components
  - Future features will follow the same pattern
- `src/shared/` - Shared resources across features
  - `ui/` - shadcn/ui components and icons (auto-installed here via components.json)
  - `hooks/` - Shared React hooks (useTheme, etc.)
  - `lib/` - Utilities and helpers
  - `types/` - Shared TypeScript types
- `src/components/` - Application-specific components
  - `form-fields/` - Reusable form components (ValidatedInput, ValidatedSelect, etc.)
- `src/db/` - Database layer
  - `schema/` - Drizzle schema definitions (single source of truth)
  - `migrations/` - Database migrations
- `src/routes/` - Thin route files that import from features
- `src/lib/` - Core infrastructure
  - `auth/` - Better Auth configuration
  - `form.ts` - TanStack Form custom hook setup
  - `env.ts` - Environment variable management
  - `security/` - Security utilities and middleware
- `src/tests/` - Test utilities and global test setup

### Environment Requirements

- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string (pooled URL for serverless)
- `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` - Direct connection URL for migrations (optional)
- `VITE_BASE_URL` - Application base URL (only required in development - use http://localhost:8888 for Netlify Dev, http://localhost:5173 for Vite)
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` - GitHub OAuth (required for OAuth login)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` - Google OAuth (required for OAuth login)
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` - Secret key for Better Auth sessions

Netlify automatically provides:

- `URL` - The main URL of your site in production
- `SITE_URL` - The site's primary URL
- `DEPLOY_URL` - The specific deploy URL
- `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` - Pooled Neon database URL
- `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` - Direct Neon database URL

### Local Development Setup

1. **Environment Files**:
   - `.env` - Main environment file
   - `.env.local` - Local overrides (git-ignored)
   - Netlify Dev will inject values from Netlify project settings

2. **OAuth Setup**:
   - OAuth credentials must be valid (not placeholders) for routes to work

3. **Development Servers**:
   - `pnpm dev` - Vite dev server only (port 5173, what to usually use)
   - `netlify dev` - Full Netlify environment with edge functions (port 8888)

### Database Connections

The app uses Neon with proper connection pooling:

- **Pooled connections** (`pooledDb`): For API routes and serverless functions
- **Unpooled connections** (`unpooledDb`): For migrations and long operations
- **Auto-detection** (`db`): Automatically selects based on environment

See `docs/database-connections.md` for detailed usage guide.

### Security Features

- **CSP Headers**: Content Security Policy with nonce-based script validation
- **Secure Cookies**: HTTPS-only, HttpOnly, SameSite protection in production
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limits for auth and API endpoints
- **Password Validation**: Strong password requirements enforced
- **Security Headers**: Full suite via Netlify Edge Functions

### Testing Infrastructure

- **Vitest**: Modern test runner with jsdom environment
- **Testing Library**: React component testing utilities
- **Coverage**: Code coverage reporting with c8
- **Mocks**: Auth and router mocks for isolated testing
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for end-to-end testing

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing, linting, and type checking
- **Netlify Deploy Previews**: Automatic preview deployments for PRs
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Husky + lint-staged for code quality
- **Multi-version Testing**: Tests run on Node.js 18 and 20

### Code Organization Patterns

- **Auth Facade**: Clean API wrapper around Better Auth client
- **Theme Hook**: Reactive theme management with system preference support
- **Centralized Icons**: Reusable icon components in shared/ui/icons
- **Auth Guards**: Flexible authentication protection for routes
- **Profile Guards**: Ensure users complete profile before accessing features
- **Environment Config**: Type-safe environment variable access
- **Form Components**: Reusable ValidatedInput, ValidatedSelect, etc. with TanStack Form

### Authentication Flow

1. **Login Methods**:
   - Email/password via `auth.signIn.email()`
   - OAuth via `auth.signInWithOAuth()` (Google, GitHub)
2. **Protected Routes**:
   - Auth guard middleware redirects unauthenticated users
   - Profile completion guard redirects incomplete profiles to `/onboarding`
   - User state cached in React Query
3. **API Routes**:
   - All auth endpoints under `/api/auth/*`
   - Handled by Better Auth via catch-all route
4. **User Type**:
   - Better Auth's `User` type doesn't include custom fields
   - Use `ExtendedUser` type from `~/lib/auth/types` for full user data
   - `getCurrentUser()` server function fetches complete user with custom fields

### Documentation

The project includes automated documentation generation:

- **API Reference**: TypeDoc generates markdown documentation for all code in `src/lib/`
  - Run `pnpm docs:reference` to update
  - Output: `docs/reference/` (gitignored except ERDs)
  - Configuration: `typedoc.json`
- **Database ERDs**: Automatically generates diagrams from mermaid definitions
  - Run `pnpm docs:erd` to update
  - Source: `docs/quadball-plan/database/schema-overview.md`
  - Output: `docs/reference/database/schema-erd.{svg,png}`
  - Uses system Chrome via `puppeteer.config.json`

### TanStack Start Server Functions

Server functions are defined using `createServerFn()` and called from React components:

1. **Best Practice - Use Zod Validation** (ALWAYS PREFER THIS):

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";
import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

// Define schema first
const myInputSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1),
  email: z.string().email(),
});

// Use .validator() with schema.parse
export const myServerFn = createServerFn({ method: "POST" })
  .validator(myInputSchema.parse)
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    // data is now properly typed from the schema
    // Server-side implementation
    return result;
  });
```

2. **Why Use Zod Validation**:
   - Provides runtime type safety, not just compile-time
   - Eliminates need for `@ts-expect-error` in most cases
   - Better error messages for invalid inputs
   - Automatic TypeScript type inference from schemas
   - Single source of truth for input validation

3. **File Organization for Server Functions**:

```
src/features/[feature]/
├── [feature].schemas.ts    # Zod schemas for all operations
├── [feature].queries.ts    # GET server functions
├── [feature].mutations.ts  # POST/PUT/DELETE server functions
├── [feature].types.ts      # TypeScript types and interfaces
└── [feature].db-types.ts   # Database-specific type overrides (if needed)
```

4. **Calling Pattern**:

```typescript
// With validation, call matches the schema structure:
const result = await myServerFn({ data: { name: "John", email: "john@example.com" } });

// For functions with no input:
const result = await myServerFn();
```

5. **Handling Complex Types (e.g., jsonb fields)**:
   - Create separate type definition files for complex database types
   - Use type overrides when extending database types
   - Add ESLint disable comments ONLY when absolutely necessary

```typescript
// events.db-types.ts
/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any */
export interface EventMetadata {
  [key: string]: any;
}

// events.types.ts
export interface EventWithDetails extends Omit<Event, "metadata"> {
  metadata: EventMetadata;
  // ... other fields
}
```

6. **Legacy Pattern** (AVOID - only for reference):

```typescript
// ❌ AVOID this pattern - it bypasses runtime validation
export const myServerFn = createServerFn({ method: "POST" }).handler(
  async ({ data }: { data: MyInputType }) => {
    return result;
  },
);
```

7. **Server-Only Module Imports**:
   - **IMPORTANT**: TanStack Start only extracts code INSIDE the `handler()` function
   - Top-level imports in server function files are included in the client bundle
   - If a module accesses server-only resources (env vars, Node APIs), it will crash in the browser

   **❌ BAD - Top-level import causes client bundle pollution:**

   ```typescript
   import { squarePaymentService } from "~/lib/payments/square"; // Accesses process.env

   export const createCheckout = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
     return squarePaymentService.createCheckoutSession(...);
   });
   ```

   **✅ GOOD - Use `serverOnly()` helper:**

   ```typescript
   import { serverOnly } from "@tanstack/react-start";

   const getSquarePaymentService = serverOnly(async () => {
     const { squarePaymentService } = await import("~/lib/payments/square");
     return squarePaymentService;
   });

   export const createCheckout = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
     const squarePaymentService = await getSquarePaymentService();
     return squarePaymentService.createCheckoutSession(...);
   });
   ```

   **✅ ALSO GOOD - Dynamic import inside handler:**

   ```typescript
   export const createCheckout = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
     const { squarePaymentService } = await import("~/lib/payments/square");
     return squarePaymentService.createCheckoutSession(...);
   });
   ```

### Best Practices for Type Safety

1. **Avoid @ts-expect-error**:
   - NEVER use `@ts-expect-error` as a first solution
   - Always try proper type definitions or validation first
   - If you must use it, add a detailed comment explaining why

2. **Server Function Type Safety Checklist**:
   - ✅ Create Zod schema for input validation
   - ✅ Use `.validator(schema.parse)` on server functions
   - ✅ Define return types explicitly
   - ✅ Create type definitions for complex database fields
   - ✅ Use type overrides for jsonb fields instead of `any`
   - ❌ Avoid type assertions like `data as Type`
   - ❌ Don't suppress errors without investigation

3. **When Adding New Features**:
   - Start with schema definitions
   - Build types from schemas using `z.infer<typeof schema>`
   - Use validation at runtime boundaries
   - Test error cases to ensure validation works

### E2E Testing with Playwright

**IMPORTANT**: Add E2E tests for all new features to ensure they work correctly from the user's perspective.

1. **Test Structure**:
   - Tests are organized by authentication requirement
   - `e2e/tests/authenticated/` - Tests requiring login
   - `e2e/tests/unauthenticated/` - Tests without login
   - Use descriptive file names: `feature.auth.spec.ts` or `feature.unauth.spec.ts`

2. **Test Data Management (CRITICAL)**:
   - **Always clean up before and after tests** to ensure isolation
   - Use cleanup utilities from `e2e/utils/cleanup.ts`
   - Example:

     ```typescript
     import { clearUserTeams } from "../../utils/cleanup";

     test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
       await clearUserTeams(page, process.env.E2E_TEST_EMAIL!);
     });

     test.afterEach(async ({ page }) => {
       try {
         await clearUserTeams(page, process.env.E2E_TEST_EMAIL!);
       } catch (error) {
         console.warn("Cleanup failed:", error);
       }
     });
     ```

3. **Writing Tests**:

   ```typescript
   import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

   test("should display user dashboard", async ({ page }) => {
     await page.goto("/dashboard");
     await expect(page.getByRole("heading", { name: /Welcome back/ })).toBeVisible();
   });
   ```

4. **Using Playwright MCP for Verification**:
   - Before using Playwright MCP:
     - Check if dev server is running: `curl -s http://localhost:5173/api/health`
     - If browser already in use, close it first: `mcp__playwright__browser_close`
   - Use MCP to verify UI behavior before writing/updating E2E tests
   - This ensures tests match actual application behavior

5. **Best Practices**:
   - Use Playwright's recommended locators: `getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText`
   - Avoid arbitrary waits - use proper wait conditions
   - Keep tests isolated and independent
   - Test user journeys, not implementation details
   - **Clean up test data** - don't leave data that affects other tests
   - Use dedicated test users for different scenarios
   - Handle known issues (like redirect parameter stripping) pragmatically

6. **Running Tests**:
   - `pnpm test:e2e:setup` - **Run this first** to seed clean test data
   - `pnpm test:e2e` - Run all E2E tests
   - `pnpm test:e2e:ui` - Interactive UI mode for debugging
   - `pnpm test:e2e --project=chromium-auth` - Run specific test suite

7. **Authentication in Tests**:
   - Shared auth state is configured in `e2e/auth.setup.ts`
   - Tests automatically use authenticated state when in `authenticated/` folder
   - Test user credentials are in `.env.e2e`
   - For tests needing fresh auth: `test.use({ storageState: undefined });`

8. **Test Users**:
   - `test@example.com` - General authenticated tests
   - `teamcreator@example.com` - Team creation (no existing teams)
   - `profile-edit@example.com` - Profile editing tests
   - See `scripts/seed-e2e-data.ts` for all test users

9. **See Also**: `docs/E2E-BEST-PRACTICES.md` for comprehensive testing guidelines

### Common Tasks

- **Add a new page**: Create file in `src/routes/`
- **Add auth to a route**: Use auth guard in route's `beforeLoad`
- **Add profile completion guard**: Use `requireCompleteProfile()` from profile feature
- **Access user data**: Use `useRouteContext()` to get user from context
- **Make API calls**: Use React Query with proper error handling
- **Add UI components**: Check `src/shared/ui/` for existing components first
- **Install shadcn components**: `npx shadcn@latest add <component>` (auto-installs to `src/shared/ui/`)
- **Update documentation**: Run `pnpm docs:all` after significant changes
- **Add a new server function**:
  1. Create schema in `[feature].schemas.ts`
  2. Use `.validator(schema.parse)` in the server function
  3. Define proper return types
  4. Handle errors with typed error responses
- **Add E2E tests for new features**:
  1. Add tests in `e2e/tests/authenticated/` or `e2e/tests/unauthenticated/`
  2. Use `.auth.spec.ts` suffix for tests requiring authentication
  3. Use `.unauth.spec.ts` suffix for tests without authentication
  4. Run `pnpm test:e2e` to execute tests locally
- **Add client-side rate limiting to server functions**:
  1. Import `useRateLimitedServerFn` from `~/lib/pacer/hooks`
  2. Wrap your server function: `const rateLimited = useRateLimitedServerFn(serverFn, { type: "api" })`
  3. Use types: "auth" (5/15min), "api" (100/1min), "search" (10/10s), "mutation" (20/1min)
  4. See `docs/rate-limiting-with-pacer.md` for full guide

## Tool available

Always use your playwright tool to navigate to localhost:5173 or 8888 to test changes before finishing

## Before using Playwright MCP

1. Check if dev server is running: `curl -s http://localhost:5173/api/health`
2. If MCP shows error about browser already in use, close it first: `mcp__playwright__browser_close`
3. Then navigate to the page you need

## Before rerunning E2E tests

Always use Playwright MCP to manually verify the expected behavior before running E2E tests. This helps ensure tests match the actual UI behavior.

## Dev server

Assume the dev server is running on 5173 or 8888 for every session, and check via playwright or curl

## Rules
Always read .cursor/rules/*

## Docs
Read /docs/quadball-plan/* as appropriate

## Development Roadmap
See /docs/development-backlog.md for prioritized feature implementation tickets
