# Jan 7 Updates

This document captures the updates I recommend based on the proposal response
and the Round 2 comment set. Each item notes the owner or dependency needed to
resolve it (you, repo verification, collaborators, viaSport), and whether it is
purely a doc change or requires code/infra work.

## Legend

- Doc-only: Update text in the proposal response.
- Code/Infra: Requires implementation or environment changes.
- Evidence: Run/collect results to back claims.

## Summary of Priorities

1. Resolve explicit comment items from Round 2.
2. Clear all placeholders/TBDs or replace with scheduled dates.
3. Ensure any new claims (Backup Vault Lock, DR drills, retention durations)
   are implemented or clearly scheduled.

## Items from Round 2 Comments

1. Performance row "final validation run TBD" -> scheduled language

- Doc-only: `docs/sin-rfp/response/full-proposal-response-combined.md:58`
- Proposed update: "Scheduled for Pre-Launch Phase" or a real date.
- Owner: You (decision on schedule wording).
- Evidence: If a specific date is chosen, confirm it matches the project plan.

2. Key Highlights timeline phrasing (community engagement)

- Doc-only: `docs/sin-rfp/response/full-proposal-response-combined.md:79`
- Proposed update: Emphasize meaningful community engagement, not checkbox
  participation.
- Owner: You (approve tone and phrasing).

3. Soleil bio acknowledgement

- No action needed (already added per comment), but verify if the current
  bio text reflects the final wording.
- Owner: Repo check (confirm the text in the combined doc matches the new bio).

4. Proposed Solution Statement (community-led framing)

- Doc-only: `docs/sin-rfp/response/full-proposal-response-combined.md:420`
- Proposed update: Frame the team as community-led/connected, highlight
  Soleil as system navigator connecting to sport community, and remove
  the placeholder "[Soleil to confirm wording]".
- Owner: You (approve exact wording).
- Collaborator input: Soleil (verify framing, approve bio/statement).

5. Team location clarification (Ruslan is Montreal-based, not Soleil)

- Doc-only: `docs/sin-rfp/response/full-proposal-response-combined.md:427`
- **Clarification**: Soleil IS BC-based. Ruslan is Montreal-based (1 of 7).
- Current "BC based" claim is accurate for 6 of 7 team members.
- Proposed options:
  - Keep as-is (6/7 is "BC based" enough)
  - Change to "primarily BC-based" or "headquartered in BC"
  - Add qualifier: "BC-based team with additional expertise from Quebec"
- Owner: You (decide if any change needed).

6. Backup protection (AWS Backup Vault Lock)

- Doc change: `docs/sin-rfp/response/full-proposal-response-combined.md:695`
- Infra change: Implement AWS Backup Vault Lock for backups.
- Owner: Repo + infra check (confirm if vault lock is already in SST or
  needs to be added).
- Collaborator input: Infra/Sec advisors if needed for configuration review.

7. DR drill scheduled week

- Doc-only: `docs/sin-rfp/response/full-proposal-response-combined.md:706`
- Proposed update: Replace "Final production drill TBD" with
  "Scheduled for Implementation Week X" or Pre-Launch Phase.
- Owner: You (pick the week/phase).
- Evidence: Run or schedule a drill before final submission.

8. Help desk low priority target ("Best effort" -> fixed target)

- Doc-only: `docs/sin-rfp/response/full-proposal-response-combined.md:1270`
- Also update the Sev 4 table: `docs/sin-rfp/response/full-proposal-response-combined.md:1320`
- Proposed update: "10 Business Days" or "Next Release Cycle".
- Owner: You (pick the target language).
- Repo check: Verify any in-product SLA values align if surfaced in UI.

9. Replace ASCII architecture diagram

- Doc-only: `docs/sin-rfp/response/full-proposal-response-combined.md:634`
- Proposed update: Replace ASCII block with `high-level-system-architecture-v2.svg`
  from `docs/sin-rfp/response/08-appendices/diagrams/`.
- Owner: Repo check (confirm which diagram is the canonical final).

10. Add transit encryption and SSL to Regulatory Alignment table

- Doc-only: `docs/sin-rfp/response/03-service-approach/data-warehousing/final.md:47`
- Also: `docs/sin-rfp/response/full-proposal-response-combined.md:671`
- Comment: "Worth adding data transit is encrypted and APIs are SSL enabled"
- Current text in PIPEDA row: "Canadian data residency, encryption, access controls, audit logging"
- Proposed update: "Canadian data residency, **TLS 1.2+ encryption in transit**, encryption at rest, access controls, audit logging"
- Or add new row: "Transport security | All APIs served over HTTPS (TLS 1.2+), no unencrypted endpoints"
- Owner: Doc-only update.

11. Highlight encryption layers in Security Model Summary

- Doc-only: `docs/sin-rfp/response/01-executive-summary/final.md:30`
- Also: `docs/sin-rfp/response/full-proposal-response-combined.md:30`
- Comment: "I would highlight data security encryption at rest, in transit and table based encryption for processing controls"
- Current text: "encryption in transit and at rest"
- Proposed update: Expand to explicitly list all three encryption layers:
  - **At rest**: AES-256 via AWS KMS for RDS, S3, and backups
  - **In transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all API endpoints and database connections
  - **Processing controls**: PostgreSQL column-level encryption for highly sensitive fields (e.g., TOTP secrets)
- Owner: Doc-only update.

## Other Placeholders / TBDs in the Combined Response

### Performance and Validation — SCHEDULED IMMINENT

- "Final validation run TBD" appears in multiple sections.
- Doc-only updates:
  - `docs/sin-rfp/response/full-proposal-response-combined.md:58`
  - `docs/sin-rfp/response/full-proposal-response-combined.md:611`
  - `docs/sin-rfp/response/full-proposal-response-combined.md:1043`
  - `docs/sin-rfp/response/full-proposal-response-combined.md:1053`
  - `docs/sin-rfp/response/full-proposal-response-combined.md:1058`
  - `docs/sin-rfp/response/full-proposal-response-combined.md:3071`
- **Status**: Will execute load + Lighthouse tests on sin-perf this week.
- **Proposed language**: "Completed January 2026" (update after run)
- Evidence: Final load + Lighthouse runs in sin-perf.
- Owner: You (schedule), repo check (ensure results are captured).

### DR Drill — SCHEDULED IMMINENT

- "Final production drill TBD" and "final run TBD": `full-proposal-response-combined.md:706`
- **Status**: Will execute DR drill on sin-perf this week.
- **Proposed language**: "Completed January 2026" (update after run)
- **Rationale**: sin-perf is isolated, has production-like config, and can be
  reset freely. This provides sufficient validation evidence without risking
  UAT stakeholder data.

### Retention Durations — PROPOSED VALUES

- "Retention durations ... TBD": `full-proposal-response-combined.md:725`
- **Status**: Policy engine implemented; durations need final approval.

**Proposed retention schedule:**

| Data Type                | Retention | Archive           | Purge   | Rationale                                      |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ----------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| audit_logs               | 7 years   | 90 days → Glacier | Never   | Regulatory compliance, hash-chain immutability |
| form_submissions         | 3 years   | 1 year            | 5 years | Operational need + audit trail                 |
| form_submission_versions | 1 year    | —                 | 2 years | Historical edits, less critical                |
| submission_files         | 3 years   | 1 year            | 5 years | Aligns with submissions                        |
| dsar_exports             | 14 days   | —                 | 30 days | Short-lived user downloads                     |
| privacy_requests         | 3 years   | —                 | 5 years | Compliance documentation                       |
| import_job_errors        | 90 days   | —                 | 90 days | Debugging window (ADR D0.8)                    |
| notifications            | 90 days   | —                 | 90 days | Transient operational data                     |
| security_events          | 2 years   | —                 | 3 years | Incident investigation window                  |
| support_requests         | 3 years   | —                 | 5 years | Customer service history                       |

- Owner: You (approve durations), then seed script update if needed.

### DR + Retention Validation — USE sin-perf

- "Final DR and retention validation (TBD)": `full-proposal-response-combined.md:1463`, `full-proposal-response-combined.md:1710`
- **Status**: Will validate on sin-perf (not UAT).
- **Rationale**: sin-perf is purpose-built for validation, can be reset without
  impacting stakeholders, and has production-equivalent configuration.
- **Proposed language**: "Validated in performance environment January 2026"

### Templates, Metadata, and Content

- viaSport templates and field definitions: `full-proposal-response-combined.md:1558`
- Catalog taxonomy refinements: `full-proposal-response-combined.md:1637`
- Threshold tuning for data quality: `full-proposal-response-combined.md:1674`

- Help center content refinement: `full-proposal-response-combined.md:2208`
- Branding assets/theme configuration: `full-proposal-response-combined.md:2449`
- Owner: viaSport input required (templates, taxonomy, metadata, branding),
  collaborators (UX/content review), repo check for implementation status.
- Code/Infra: implement templates, metadata fields, and branding once inputs
  are received.

### Migration Pipelines

- Additional migration pipelines for org and user records: `full-proposal-response-combined.md:1749`
- Owner: You (prioritize), viaSport (legacy access + schema), repo check
  (pipeline status).
- Code/Infra: Build the pipelines and mapping once schema access is granted.

### DM-AGG-006 Upgrade — INTELLIGENT IMPORT NOW BUILT

The intelligent XLSX/CSV import feature (ticket: `docs/sin-rfp/tickets/TICKET-intelligent-xlsx-import.md`)
is now substantially complete and should be reflected in the proposal.

**Current proposal text** (`04-system-requirements/data-management-dm-agg/final.md:12`):
| DM-AGG-006 | Partial | Import wizard, file imports, ECS batch worker | Legacy extraction scope |

**Recommended update:**
| DM-AGG-006 | **Built** | Smart import wizard with error categorization, autofix, dynamic templates | Legacy extraction (awaiting BCAR/BCSI) |

**New capabilities to highlight in DM-AGG-006 detail section:**

1. **Intelligent Error Categorization**: Errors grouped by root cause (structural, data quality, completeness, referential) instead of row-by-row
2. **Pattern Detection**: 13 pattern detectors (email, date formats, phone, currency, postal codes, UUID, etc.) automatically identify column type mismatches
3. **Autofix with Confidence Scoring**: One-click fixes for column swaps, date format conversion, boolean normalization; dynamic confidence based on pattern match ratio, header hints, and sample size
4. **In-App Correction**: Inline cell editing with real-time validation, eliminating re-upload for minor fixes
5. **Dynamic Templates**: Generate XLSX/CSV templates from any form definition with field descriptions, example values, and Excel data validation dropdowns
6. **Virtualized Preview**: TanStack Virtual for 10k+ row previews without performance degradation
7. **Admin Template Management**: Template CRUD, version tracking, import history with rollback

**Files to update:**
- `04-system-requirements/data-management-dm-agg/final.md:12` (status table)
- `04-system-requirements/data-management-dm-agg/final.md:203` (DM-AGG-006 detail)
- `04-system-requirements/00-compliance-crosswalk/final.md:22` (crosswalk table)
- `full-proposal-response-combined.md:1464`, `:1531`, `:1722`

**Demo path update:**
Current: "Dashboard -> Imports -> New Import"
Proposed: "Dashboard -> Admin -> Imports (Smart wizard with autofix demo)"

### Training and Cohort Planning — POST-CONTRACT

- Cohort sizing and scheduling TBD: `full-proposal-response-combined.md:1179`
- Sample training materials review TBD: `full-proposal-response-combined.md:1221`
- **Status**: These are implementation activities that occur after contract award.
  Not blocking for proposal submission. Leave as "TBD pending contract award"
  or "To be scheduled during Implementation Phase."
- Owner: viaSport input + collaborators (UX/training) for content review.

  This is standard RFP language.

## Recommended Workstream Breakdown

### Needs Your Decision/Approval

- ~~Replace all "TBD" schedule language with approved phrasing or dates.~~
  **DECIDED**: Performance/DR = imminent (this week), training/project start = post-contract.
- ~~Decide on SLA low-priority target language.~~ **DECIDED**: "10 Business Days"
- ~~Decide on SLA auto-calculation.~~ **DECIDED**: Yes, implement auto-set based on priority.
- Confirm how to position community-led/connected framing in the
  Proposed Solution Statement. _(Still needs Soleil input)_
- Confirm whether "BC-based" language should be removed or qualified.
  _(Still needs Soleil input)_
- ~~Approve which architecture diagram is canonical.~~ **DECIDED**: Use v2 SVGs.
- **NEW**: Approve proposed retention durations (see table above).

### Needs Repo/Infra Verification — COMPLETED

- ~~Confirm current backup protection and whether AWS Backup Vault Lock exists
  in SST config.~~ **VERIFIED**: Not configured; will implement.
- ~~Confirm where SLA targets are surfaced in the product, if anywhere.~~
  **VERIFIED**: Schema exists, manual admin entry; will add auto-calculation.
- ~~Confirm retention duration configuration and legal hold defaults in code.~~
  **VERIFIED**: Implemented with seed script defaults.
- ~~Confirm migration pipelines status for org/user records.~~
  **VERIFIED**: Not implemented; awaiting viaSport legacy access.

### Needs Collaborator Input

- Soleil: bio + language for community-led framing.
- Will: bio for Appendix F.
- Michael: bio for Appendix F.
- UX/content partners: review help center and walkthrough copy once viaSport
  terminology is available.

### Needs viaSport Input

- Legacy system access + schema (BCAR/BCSI).
- Data dictionary, reporting metadata field definitions.
- Templates, sample data, taxonomy/tagging preferences.
- Branding assets (logo, colors, typography).
- Retention durations and escalation contacts for data quality thresholds.
- Training cohorts and schedule confirmation.

## Repo/Infra Verification Results (2026-01-07)

The following items were verified by scanning the codebase:

### 1. AWS Backup Vault Lock — NOT CONFIGURED

**Status**: Gap requiring implementation.

The `sst.config.ts` contains:

- RDS automated backups with retention (35 days for prod, 7 days for dev/perf)
- S3 Object Lock on `SinArtifacts` bucket (DSAR exports)
- S3 Object Lock on `SinAuditArchives` bucket (7-year GOVERNANCE mode for prod)
- CloudTrail bucket lifecycle (archive to Glacier after 90 days)

**Missing**: AWS Backup Vault Lock for RDS automated snapshots. This would provide
immutable backup protection beyond the standard RDS snapshot lifecycle.

**Action Required**:

- Add AWS Backup Vault resource to `sst.config.ts` (or via Pulumi aws.backup)
- Configure vault lock policy with GOVERNANCE or COMPLIANCE mode
- Reference: `sst.config.ts:140-165` (current RDS backup config)

### 2. Retention Policies — IMPLEMENTED

**Status**: Confirmed working.

- Retention policy engine: `src/lib/privacy/retention.ts` (647 lines)
- Cron job: `src/cron/enforce-retention.ts` (runs daily per `sst.config.ts:657-670`)
- Seed script: `scripts/seed-retention-policies.ts`
- Database schema: `src/db/schema/privacy.schema.ts:100-116`

**Default policies** (from seed script):
| Data Type | Retention | Archive After | Purge After |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| dsar_exports | 14 days | — | 30 days |
| audit_logs | 7 years | 90 days | Never (immutable) |
| form_submissions | 3 years | 1 year | 5 years |
| import_job_errors | 90 days | — | 90 days |

**Note**: Audit logs are marked immutable (hash chain integrity) and are archived
to S3 Glacier Deep Archive but never deleted.

### 3. DR Drill — EVIDENCE EXISTS

**Status**: Completed for sin-dev on 2025-12-30.

Evidence location: `docs/sin-rfp/review-plans/evidence/DR-DRILL-sin-dev-20251230.md`

- Snapshot restored in ~5 minutes (RTO target: 4 hours ✓)
- RPO for dev environments: 24h (daily snapshots)
- RPO for production: 1h (PITR enabled, Multi-AZ)
- Drill validated: connectivity, table counts, data integrity

**Final production drill** can be scheduled for Pre-Launch Phase once sin-prod
is ready for testing. The sin-dev drill serves as process validation.

### 4. SLA Targets in Product — PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**Status**: Schema supports SLA but no fixed defaults in code.

- Support requests have `slaTargetAt` field (`src/db/schema/support.schema.ts:48`)
- Admins manually set SLA targets via datetime picker in admin panel
- No automatic calculation based on priority level

**Gap**: The proposal mentions specific SLA targets (e.g., "10 Business Days" for
low priority), but the product does not enforce or calculate these automatically.
This is acceptable if SLAs are contractual rather than system-enforced.

**If auto-calculation is desired**, add logic to:

- `src/features/support/support.mutations.ts` (on create/update)
- Map priority → default SLA offset (e.g., urgent=1 business day, low=10 days)

### 5. Architecture Diagrams — V2 EXISTS

**Status**: Canonical v2 diagrams available.

Location: `docs/sin-rfp/response/08-appendices/diagrams/`

Available diagrams:

- `high-level-system-architecture-v2.svg` ← Use for ASCII replacement
- `security-architecture-v2.svg`
- `multi-tenant-architecture-v2.svg`
- `data-flow-diagram-v2.svg`

**Action**: Replace ASCII diagram at line 634 with reference to
`high-level-system-architecture-v2.svg`.

### 6. Migration Pipelines — NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Status**: Pending viaSport legacy access.

No migration pipelines exist for org/user records from BCAR/BCSI. The import
infrastructure (`src/workers/import-batch.ts`, ECS task in `sst.config.ts:538-559`)
is ready, but legacy schema access is required to build the mappings.

### 7. Performance Testing — RUNBOOK EXISTS

**Status**: Ready to execute.

Runbook location: `docs/sin-rfp/review-plans/performance-test-runbook.md`

Prerequisites:

- Deploy `sin-perf` stage: `AWS_PROFILE=techdev npx sst deploy --stage sin-perf`
- Create perf test user (no MFA) for automation
- Generate 20M synthetic rows per runbook Phase 3

**I can execute this runbook** if you want to validate performance claims.

## In-Progress Work (2026-01-08)

### Security Scanning — NOW OPERATIONAL

The security CI/CD pipeline is now fully operational, validating the proposal claims.

**Implemented Workflows** (`.github/workflows/`):

| Tool              | Type             | Trigger                    | Status    |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- | --------- |
| Aikido            | SAST + Secrets   | push/PR to main            | ✓ Running |
| CodeQL            | SAST             | push/PR to main            | ✓ Running |
| ZAP               | DAST             | PR + weekly (Mon 4:41 UTC) | ✓ Running |
| Snyk              | SCA/Dependencies | push/PR to main            | ✓ Running |
| Dependency Review | SCA              | PR only                    | ✓ Running |

**First Scan Results** (see `docs/tickets/ci-security-findings-2026-01-08.md`):

- 54 total findings across all scanners
- 2 Critical (SQL injection in BI engine, open redirect)
- 3 High (credential logging, xlsx prototype pollution, file inclusion)
- Remediation in progress

**Proposal Alignment**: The proposal correctly claims:

- "SAST + SCA (for example CodeQL/Semgrep, Dependabot/Snyk)" — We have CodeQL + Aikido (SAST), Snyk + Dependency Review (SCA) ✓
- "DAST (for example OWASP ZAP)" — We have ZAP baseline scanning ✓

**No doc updates needed** — the "for example" language already covers our actual tooling.
The proposal was forward-looking and is now validated by implementation.

### sin-perf Deployment — IN PROGRESS

Performance environment being deployed for load testing, DR drill, and retention validation.
See updated runbook: `docs/sin-rfp/review-plans/performance-test-runbook.md`

## **Tier 0** 

### **A) Identity, user admission, and cross-org sharing (SEC‑AGG‑001 \+ real-world tenancy)**

1. **SSO at launch?**  
   “Is federated login required at launch? If yes: which identity provider(s) (Azure AD, Google Workspace, BC Services Card, other) and protocol (SAML / OIDC)?”  
   **Why it matters:** SSO can be 1–6+ weeks depending on complexity and stakeholder coordination.  
2. **MFA enforcement policy**  
   “Should MFA be mandatory for *all* users, or only admins/viaSport staff? Any exceptions (e.g., service accounts)?”  
   **Why:** changes onboarding UX, support volume, and security controls.  
3. **User admission model**  
   “Is access invite-only, request-to-join, or self-registration allowed? Who approves (viaSport, PSO admin, both)?”  
   **Why:** determines workflows, permissions, and audit trails.  
4. **Cross-organization data sharing**  
   “Should any data be visible across organizations (e.g., PSOs seeing each other’s data, sector benchmarking, public dashboards), or is everything private except viaSport admins?”  
   **Why:** this is a *major* architecture and permissioning decision. It’s also aligned with the RFP’s “break down silos / information sharing” language.

---

### **B) Reporting metadata that drives RP‑AGG‑002 (your biggest “partial”)**

5. **Mandatory metadata fields (MVP list)**  
   “For RP‑AGG‑002, what is the minimum set of required fields at launch (contribution agreements, NCCP, contact details, fiscal periods, org profiles, delegated access)?”  
   **Why:** defines database schema \+ UI screens \+ validation.  
6. **Authoritative source & validation rules**  
   “Are any RP‑AGG‑002 fields sourced from an authoritative system (e.g., official NCCP registry), or is Solstice the system of record? Any required validation rules (formats, enumerations)?”  
   **Why:** changes whether you build validation-only vs integration.

---

### **C) Legacy extraction \+ migration reality (DM‑AGG‑006 \+ DM‑AGG‑002)**

7. **BCAR/BCSI extraction method (what’s actually possible)**  
   “What export methods exist today for BCAR and BCSI: database access, API, CSV export, vendor-managed export? Who controls access?”  
   **Why:** determines migration approach and risk.  
8. **Sample exports \+ data dictionary availability**  
   “Can viaSport provide (a) a representative export (redacted if needed), and (b) any schema docs / field definitions for BCAR and BCSI?”  
   **Why:** without this, your migration plan is a guess.  
9. **Attachment/document migration scope**  
   “Do BCAR/BCSI contain attachments that must be migrated? If yes: approximate count, typical size, and any special handling (retention/legal holds)?”  
   **Why:** file migration complexity and cost can spike fast.

---

### **D) Retention, legal hold, and DR acceptance criteria (DM‑AGG‑005 \+ SEC‑AGG‑004)**

10. **Retention schedule by data type**  
    “What are the required retention periods for: submissions, metadata, attachments, audit logs, and support tickets?”  
    **Why:** you can’t finalize retention engine rules without it.  
11. **Legal hold triggers and authority**  
    “Who can place a legal hold, what triggers it, and should holds apply at user/org/record level?”  
    **Why:** defines admin workflows and enforcement.  
12. **RPO/RTO targets that the business will sign off on**  
    “Confirm required RPO/RTO targets for production and whether they are constrained by cyber insurance or funder expectations.”  
    **Why:** determines Multi‑AZ, backup strategy, DR drills, and cost.

---

### **E) Accessibility sign-off criteria (UI‑AGG‑003)**

13. **WCAG level \+ testing method**  
    “Confirm required WCAG version/level (e.g., 2.1 AA / 2.2 AA). Is automated testing sufficient, or is manual testing with assistive tech required for sign-off?”  
    **Why:** changes cost and timeline; it’s also easy to scope clearly.

---

### **F) Integrations required at launch (DM‑AGG‑002)**

14. **Named systems \+ must-have cadence**  
    “What external systems are required at launch for import/export/integration? For each: data objects \+ cadence (real-time, nightly, quarterly) \+ format.”  
    **Why:** integration scope is the most common hidden scope-creep area.  
15. **API expectation vs export-only**  
    “Is a public partner API required for launch, or is CSV/Excel export sufficient until a later phase?”  
    **Why:** API hardening, auth, rate limits, and documentation add real work.

If you only ask 10–15 questions total, ask **these**.

---

## **Tier 1 — Discovery Week 1–2 questions that convert “requirements” into specs**

These are still impactful, but you can survive submission without them.

### **1\) Data model and org structure (DM‑AGG‑003 \+ RP workflows)**

16. “What is the required org hierarchy (viaSport → PSO → club → team/region)? Is ‘club’ a first-class entity or just a field?”  
17. “Do users belong to multiple orgs? If yes, how should permissions work?”  
18. “Are there auditor/read-only roles outside viaSport? Who grants that access?”

### **2\) Notification rules (UI‑AGG‑004 \+ RP‑AGG‑003)**

19. “Which reminder types are required (upcoming due date, overdue, resubmission requested, approval needed)? What cadence is expected?”  
20. “Any restrictions on email content (PII allowed/not allowed), sender domain/from-name, and logging/audit expectations?”  
21. “Is SMS required or explicitly out of scope?”

### **3\) File handling specifics (DM‑AGG‑001, RP‑AGG‑004)**

22. “Is multi-file upload required in any single field? Max file size and allowed types?”  
23. “Who can delete/replace a file after submission (reporter, PSO admin, viaSport only)?”  
24. “Do you require malware scanning for uploads?” (This is a big cost/architecture fork — ask early.)

### **4\) Templates and approval workflow (TO‑AGG‑001)**

25. “Which templates must be pre-seeded at launch (import templates, reporting templates, form templates)?”  
26. “What is the approval process for template updates (who approves, how often, versioning expectations)?”

### **5\) Data quality metrics (DM‑AGG‑004)**

27. “Which data quality metrics matter most (missing fields, invalid values, outliers, duplicates)? Any thresholds you already use?”  
28. “Who receives data quality alerts (viaSport admins only, PSO admins, both)?”

### **6\) Search scope (UI‑AGG‑005)**

29. “Which entities must be searchable globally (forms, submissions, orgs, people, templates, audit logs)?”  
30. “Should search results respect role \+ org scope strictly, or do admins get cross-org results?”

### **7\) Support workflow integration (UI‑AGG‑006, TO‑AGG‑003)**

31. “Do you want support handled fully inside Solstice, or integrated with an existing tool (Jira Service Management, Zendesk, Freshdesk, etc.)?”  
32. “Confirm SLA expectations and escalation path (who is on-call, what counts as critical).”

---

## **Tier 2 — Optional / “don’t block MVP” questions**

These are good questions, but they don’t need to be answered to build the core system.

33. **SOC 2 / ISO 27001**  
    “Do you require the vendor to be certified (SOC 2 Type II / ISO 27001), or is alignment with controls acceptable?”  
    (Keep it simple; certification is a *commercial* requirement as much as technical.)  
34. **AI governance**  
    “If AI features are prioritized, what governance is required (human review, transparency labeling, bias testing, data usage restrictions)?”  
    This is roadmap — don’t let it contaminate MVP scope.  
35. **Community participation / research expectations**  
    “What is the expected breadth of community participation (PSOs, clubs, athletes) in UX research and design validation?”  
    Important, but it’s a delivery planning question, not a system blocker.

# Request for Proposal

## Strength in Numbers Project

### B.C. Amateur Sport Information Management System Replacement

**December 2025**

**viaSport British Columbia**
409 Granville St #1351
Vancouver, BC V6C 1T2
www.viasport.ca

---

## Overview and Background

viaSport BC Society (viaSport) is an independent not-for-profit organization and a legacy entity of the Vancouver 2010 Olympics and Paralympic Games, operating as the provincial government's lead agency responsible for promoting and developing amateur sport in British Columbia.

For 15+ years viaSport has collected, stored and analyzed a substantial part of BC's amateur sport sector data, enabling informed decision-making, policy development and strategic planning.

Created over a decade ago, viaSport's information management systems are outdated and no longer meet the sport sector's fast-evolving information needs.

viaSport is seeking an experienced technology partner to design, implement, and support a modern, secure, and scalable solution that will transform how British Columbia's amateur sport sector captures, shares, and leverages information – setting a robust digital foundation for the province's next decade of sport development.

viaSport invites technology partners to propose innovative and integrated solutions that advance our reporting, analytics and information-sharing capabilities. Ideal submissions will demonstrate an integrated information ecosystem with automated and advanced analytics, including potential AI-enabled features. We welcome creative solutions that empower users, break down silos, and promote collaboration across the B.C. amateur sports sector.

viaSport welcomes responses from a range of partners, including product companies, data and analytics firms, research and innovation labs, and consortia that combine technology, data science, and sector expertise. Proposals that responsibly leverage open-source technologies, open standards, and interoperable APIs are accepted where they strengthen sustainability, transparency, and sector-wide value.

Beyond replacing legacy systems, this project is an opportunity to create a foundational digital layer for amateur sport in B.C. – a shared data and information platform that will shape how participation, funding, equity, and impact are understood for years to come. We are seeking a partner who can help viaSport responsibly embrace modern data management, interoperable APIs, automation, and AI-enabled insights. The goal is to move from static reports to living, trusted data assets that can power future programs, applications, and innovations across the entire sport ecosystem.

# Executive Summary

Austin Wallace Tech responds to viaSport British Columbia's Request for Proposal for the Strength in Numbers Project. We built a working prototype that aligns to the System Requirements Addendum and demonstrates delivery feasibility before contract award.

## What viaSport is Buying

Solstice is proposed as a **term subscription with managed service**, structured to reduce ongoing procurement overhead and operational risk:

- **3-year base term**, with two optional 1-year extensions at viaSport's discretion
- **Implementation/Standup** to complete viaSport configuration, migration, UAT, and rollout
- **Platform Subscription + Managed Service** covering hosting, monitoring, security patching, support, ongoing product updates, and 200 hours/year of enhancement capacity

This "batteries included" model means viaSport procures implementation and operations in a single award, avoiding annual re-procurement of managed services.

## Standard Assumptions and Security Posture

The statements below apply across this response unless noted.

### 1.1 Data Residency and Privacy Summary

Primary data stores (RDS PostgreSQL, S3 object storage, backups, and audit
archives) are hosted in AWS Canada (Central) (ca-central-1). Authenticated
content is configured to avoid edge caching. Email notifications are delivered
to recipients and may traverse external networks.

### 1.2 Security Model Summary

The security model follows the AWS shared responsibility approach: AWS secures
the underlying cloud infrastructure, and we implement and operate the
application controls, configuration, and monitoring required for viaSport's use
case. The platform implements MFA, role-based access control, organization
scoping, and an immutable audit log with tamper-evident hashing.

**Encryption layers:**

- **At rest:** AES-256 via AWS KMS for RDS, S3, and backups
- **In transit:** TLS 1.2+ for all API endpoints and database connections
- **Processing controls:** PostgreSQL column-level encryption for highly sensitive fields (e.g., TOTP secrets)

Security evidence is summarized in **Appendix D:
Security Architecture Summary**. AWS compliance reports (SOC, ISO) are available
via AWS Artifact upon request.

### 1.3 Prototype and Data Provenance Summary

A working prototype is available for evaluation in the sin-uat environment. No
viaSport confidential data was used. Performance testing is run in sin-perf
using synthetic data designed to match the scale characteristics described in
the RFP. Performance and accessibility evidence is summarized in **Appendix C:
Performance Evidence**. Demo access is provided via a secure Evaluator Access Pack
(see **Appendix A**), and a 15-minute validation path is provided in the **Prototype
Evaluation Guide**.

## Key Highlights

**De-risked Delivery**
A working prototype is available for evaluation. This reduces delivery risk and
allows evaluators to validate requirements directly. Access details are in
**Appendix A: Prototype Evaluation Access**. The **Prototype Evaluation Guide** provides a
15-minute validation path tied to requirement IDs. See Section 1.3 for the
standard prototype and data provenance summary.

**Requirements Coverage**
The prototype covers the majority of the System Requirements Addendum today. Two requirements remain partial and are explicitly scoped with viaSport dependencies and delivery approach. The **System Requirements Compliance Crosswalk** provides the requirement-by-requirement view.

**Security and Residency**
See Section 1.1 for data residency and privacy, and Section 1.2 for the
security model summary and evidence references.

**Managed Service Model**
viaSport is purchasing an outcome: a reliable platform with clear service levels,
operational ownership, and included enhancement capacity. The subscription includes
monitoring, support, security patching, DR drills, and 200 hours/year for ongoing
improvements. See **Commercial Model and Pricing** for details.

**Delivery Timeline**
The proposed 30-week timeline targets Fall 2026 launch with comprehensive UX research and community engagement. The timeline enables proper user research with viaSport staff and PSO representatives, UAT with accessibility validation, and phased rollout. The core platform is already built, so the additional time focuses on getting the user experience right rather than building new features.

## Demo Access

Demo credentials are listed in **Appendix A: Prototype Evaluation Access** to reduce reviewer friction.

**Contact:** austinwallacetech@gmail.com

**Environment:** sin-uat (User Acceptance Testing environment with evaluator
access and CloudTrail monitoring). Performance testing is run in sin-perf.

**MFA:** The viaSport Staff account has MFA enabled to demonstrate the full authentication flow. Other demo accounts have MFA disabled for faster evaluation.

**Data:** Synthetic only, with environment monitoring enabled (CloudTrail with CIS Benchmark alarms).

## What to Ignore in the Prototype

Some elements are placeholders and will be replaced with viaSport-approved content during Discovery:

- Form labels and field names (will match viaSport terminology)
- Sample templates (will be replaced with viaSport reporting templates)
- Help center content (will be refined per UX interviews)
- Logo and color scheme (will apply viaSport branding assets)

## 15-Minute Demo Script

1. Login and MFA, authenticate with email/password and complete TOTP
2. Dashboard, observe role-based content (admin vs reporter)
3. Form Builder, create a test form with required fields and file upload
4. Submit Data, complete and submit the form, observe status tracking
5. Version History, edit submission and view change history with attribution
6. Analytics, build a pivot table and export to CSV
7. Audit Logs, review recent actions and verify hash chain integrity
8. Security Dashboard, review recent security events and account lockouts (SEC-AGG-002)
9. Privacy and Retention, view retention policies and legal hold capabilities (SEC-AGG-003)
10. Help Center, search for a topic and view contextual guidance
11. Import Wizard, upload CSV, map fields, preview validation results

## What Makes This a Low-Risk Procurement Choice

viaSport is not purchasing a one-time "web project." viaSport is purchasing an outcome: a reliable platform that supports ongoing reporting cycles with predictable support, monitoring, and updates.

Solstice is positioned like an enterprise platform engagement:

- viaSport receives a **subscription + managed service** with defined service levels
- viaSport retains **control of its configuration and content** (forms, templates, reporting definitions)
- viaSport retains **full access to its data** with export/portability options at any time
- Continuity and exit risk can be mitigated through **escrow and transition options** (see Exit & Portability Appendix)

## Proposed Solution Statement

Austin Wallace Tech proposes the Solstice platform, a purpose-built, reliable, and secure information management system aligned to the Strength in Numbers requirements.

### Key Differentiators

**1. Working Prototype, Not a Proposal**

A functional prototype already exists and is available for evaluation. It
addresses the majority of System Requirements Addendum items today and has
been load-tested at production scale with 20.1 million rows.

**2. Principal-Led Delivery**

The architect and primary developer of the prototype will lead delivery. This
reduces knowledge transfer risk and provides direct accountability.

**3. Domain Expertise in Sport Data**

The team combines enterprise data engineering with direct sport sector
operations experience. Soleil Heaney brings perspective as a PSO executive,
ensuring the platform reflects how sport organizations actually work.

**4. British Columbia Based**

The core team is based in British Columbia and remaining roles are expected to
be BC based.

**5. Canadian Data Residency**

See Section 1.1, Data Residency and Privacy Summary.

**6. Security and Privacy by Design**

Security and privacy are built into delivery from discovery through operations.
See Section 1.2, Security Model Summary.

Our approach aligns with OWASP application security practices, including the
OWASP Top 10 and OWASP ASVS as a verification framework.

**Security by Design Approach**

- **Security requirements up front:** Define security and privacy requirements
  during discovery (access control, retention, audit, monitoring), then
  validate them in the prototype and UAT.
- **Threat modeling:** Run threat modeling for the core workflows
  (authentication, imports, exports, delegated access) and track mitigations as
  delivery items.
- **Shift-left DevSecOps:** Automated code and dependency scanning in CI so
  issues are found before deployment.
- **Zero-trust access model:** MFA, RBAC, and organization scoping enforced
  server-side for all data access.
- **Data protection and Canadian hosting region:** See Section 1.1.
- **Monitoring and anomaly response:** Detect suspicious authentication
  patterns, alert administrators, and apply automated lockout controls.
- **Immutable audit and integrity:** Tamper-evident audit logging and retention
  controls to support forensic review and regulatory reporting.

### Benefits to viaSport

- **Reduced Risk:** Evaluate a working system before committing.
- **Predictable Costs:** Term subscription with included enhancement hours.
- **Direct Accountability:** Principal-led delivery with no organizational layers.
- **Sector Understanding:** Experience leading amateur sport organizations, not just building software.
- **Secure and Safe:** Embedding security and privacy by design from day one.
- **Sustainability:** Serverless architecture and infrastructure as code reduce operating overhead.
- **Exit Options:** Data portability, escrow, and transition support available.

# Solution Overview

## Workflow Summary

The Solstice platform supports the full reporting lifecycle from PSO submission
to viaSport oversight and analytics.

1. PSOs submit data through forms, file uploads, or imports.
2. Validation rules check required fields and formatting on submission.
3. Reporting status is tracked with reminders and resubmission workflows.
4. Analytics and dashboards surface trends with role-based access controls.
5. Audit logs capture data changes, exports, and admin actions.

## Multi-Tenant Model

Each organization has isolated data and role-based permissions. viaSport admins
can view cross-organization reporting and analytics, while PSOs only access
their own records.

## viaSport Administrator Capabilities

- Configure forms and reporting cycles
- Manage organization access and delegated roles
- Monitor submission status and compliance
- Review audit logs and security events
- Set retention policies and legal holds
- Export analytics with audit logging

## PSO Capabilities

- Submit reports and supporting files
- Track submission status and deadlines
- Correct validation errors and resubmit
- View organization-level dashboards
- Export approved datasets within role permissions

## Migration Summary

Legacy data is extracted, mapped, validated, and imported with an auditable
trail and rollback support. See **Service Approach: Data Migration** for the
detailed migration plan and cutover steps.

# Service Approach: Data Submission and Reporting Web Portal

## UX Strategy and Approach

The Solstice portal is designed to make data submission efficient for non-technical administrators. The UX approach is role-based, task-focused, and aligned to reporting deadlines.

| User Group              | Primary Tasks                           | UX Focus                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| viaSport Administrators | Oversight, analytics, compliance review | Cross-org dashboards, audit access, admin tools          |
| PSO Reporters           | Data submission, report tracking        | Streamlined forms, progress tracking, deadline awareness |
| Data Stewards           | Data quality, imports                   | Validation tools, error resolution, bulk operations      |

### Role-Based Portal Design

Each user sees a personalized dashboard based on role and organization. The dashboard surfaces relevant actions, pending tasks, and submission status without requiring deep navigation.

### Navigation and Workflow

- **Dashboard-led navigation:** Cards and summaries link directly to forms, reporting tasks, analytics, and support.
- **Command palette:** Keyboard navigation (Cmd or Ctrl plus K) to jump to pages, forms, and records.
- **Contextual links:** Templates, guides, and support appear alongside relevant tasks.

### Responsive Design

The interface adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports. Core workflows remain available on mobile for reviewers and administrators on the go.

### Accessibility

The interface is built on Radix UI primitives and shadcn/ui components, which
provide keyboard navigation and ARIA defaults. Accessibility evidence is
summarized in Section 1.3.

### UX Refinement Process

During Planning and Discovery we will:

- Validate navigation structure against real viaSport workflows
- Identify friction points from legacy system usage
- Refine dashboard widgets to surface the most relevant information
- Apply viaSport branding and terminology

Detailed functional compliance for forms, submissions, and reporting lives in **System Requirements Compliance Crosswalk** (DM-AGG-001 and RP-AGG-003).

# Service Approach: Data Warehousing

## Hosting Solution, Tenancy Model, Data Residency, and Regulatory Alignment

### Hosting Solution

The platform is hosted entirely on Amazon Web Services in a serverless architecture that reduces infrastructure overhead.

| Component        | AWS Service       | Purpose                                    |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Application Tier | Lambda            | Serverless compute, auto-scaling           |
| Database         | RDS PostgreSQL    | Managed relational database                |
| Caching          | ElastiCache Redis | Rate limiting, BI caching, permissions     |
| Object Storage   | S3                | Documents, import files, audit archives    |
| CDN              | CloudFront        | Edge caching, static asset delivery        |
| Message Queue    | SQS               | Asynchronous notification processing       |
| Batch Processing | ECS Fargate       | Large file import processing               |
| Email            | SES               | Transactional email delivery               |
| Scheduling       | EventBridge       | Scheduled jobs for retention and reminders |
| Secrets          | Secrets Manager   | Credential storage (SST-managed)           |
| Encryption Keys  | KMS               | Key management for encryption at rest      |

### Data Residency

Standard data residency assumptions are defined in Section 1.1. The table below
lists the specific data stores and regions for this service approach.

| Data Type            | Storage Location      | Region       |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| Application database | RDS PostgreSQL        | ca-central-1 |
| Documents and files  | S3                    | ca-central-1 |
| Audit archives       | S3 Deep Archive       | ca-central-1 |
| Backups              | RDS automated backups | ca-central-1 |

See Section 1.2 for the shared responsibility model and AWS Artifact
references.

### Tenancy Model

The platform uses a multi-tenant architecture with strict organization scoping:

- Every query is scoped to the user's organization.
- Role-based access control restricts actions by role.
- Field-level permissions control visibility of sensitive data.
- Cross-organization access requires explicit admin privileges.

### Regulatory Alignment

| Requirement         | Implementation                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PIPEDA alignment    | Canadian data residency, TLS 1.2+ encryption in transit, encryption at rest, access controls, audit logging |
| Transport security  | All APIs served over HTTPS (TLS 1.2+); no unencrypted endpoints                            |
| Data minimization   | Configurable retention policies and legal holds                                            |
| Right to access     | Data export workflows with audit trail                                                     |
| Breach notification | Audit logging and anomaly detection                                                        |

AWS maintains a Data Processing Addendum that covers all services used by the platform, including SES for email delivery: https://d1.awsstatic.com/legal/aws-dpa/aws-dpa.pdf

### Sub-Processors

| Service              | Provider | Purpose                   | Data Residency        |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Cloud infrastructure | AWS      | Hosting, compute, storage | Canada (ca-central-1) |
| Email delivery       | AWS SES  | Transactional emails      | Canada (ca-central-1) |

No additional sub-processors are used.

## Backup, Recovery, and Encryption Standards

### Backup Strategy

| Parameter                | Value                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Backup frequency         | Continuous (point-in-time recovery)            |
| Backup retention         | 35 days in production, 7 days in dev and perf  |
| Backup location          | RDS automated backups, ca-central-1            |
| Cross-region replication | Not enabled (single-region for data residency) |

### Recovery Objectives

| Metric                         | Target              | Evidence                               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Recovery Point Objective (RPO) | 1 hour (production) | Final production drill TBD             |
| Recovery Time Objective (RTO)  | 4 hours             | sin-dev drill completed, final run TBD |

Evidence for the latest DR drill is summarized in Section 1.3.

### High Availability

Production uses Multi-AZ for automatic failover. Dev and perf use single-AZ for cost efficiency.

### Encryption Standards

**In Transit:** TLS 1.2+ for client and service communication.

**At Rest:** AES-256 via AWS KMS for database storage and S3 objects.

Encryption evidence is summarized in Section 1.2.

### Audit Log Retention and Archival

Audit logs are immutable and archived to S3 Deep Archive based on retention policy configuration. Retention durations and archive schedules will be finalized with viaSport (TBD). Legal holds are supported to prevent deletion.

### Why PostgreSQL (Not a Columnar Warehouse)

viaSport's scale of 20M historical rows with 1M rows per year is well within PostgreSQL capability. A dedicated columnar warehouse would add cost and complexity without benefit at this scale.

| Factor                        | PostgreSQL        | Columnar Warehouse          |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------- |

# Service Approach: Data Migration

## Migration Methodology

### Approach

Migration follows a phased approach that reduces risk and validates data at each stage. BCAR and BCSI remain the source of truth until viaSport signs off on migrated data.

### Migration Phases

| Phase                      | Duration    | Activities                                                          | Exit Criteria              |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Discovery                  | Weeks 1-6   | Obtain sample exports, document legacy schemas, assess data quality | Schema mapping approved    |
| Mapping and Transformation | Weeks 7-10  | Build mapping templates, define validation rules, test with samples | Templates validated        |
| Pilot Migration            | Weeks 11-14 | Migrate subset (one PSO), validate accuracy, refine mappings        | Pilot data verified        |
| Full Migration             | Weeks 15-18 | Migrate organizations, users, submissions, documents                | Reconciliation checks pass |
| Validation and Cutover     | Weeks 19-22 | Full reconciliation, UAT on migrated data                           | Sign-off received          |

### Migration Sequence

1. Organizations and hierarchies
2. Users and role assignments
3. Historical submissions
4. Documents and attachments

### Mapping Process

Mapping templates define source fields, target fields, transformation rules, and validation requirements. Templates are reviewed and approved by viaSport before execution.

### Cleansing

Data quality issues are handled through:

- Format normalization for dates and numeric values
- Enum mapping to align legacy values with new fields
- Duplicate detection and manual review workflows

### Validation

Every imported record is validated against form definitions and required fields. Validation errors are logged with row-level detail for correction.

### Rollback

Imports are tagged with an `import_job_id`. Imports can be rolled back within the configured window (7 days by default) if issues are discovered after load.

## Audit Trail and Success Verification

### Audit Trail

Migration actions are logged with:

- Import job creation, status changes, and completion
- Mapping template creation and updates
- Row-level validation errors
- Rollback events

Import jobs and audit logs provide traceability for each migration run. Retention durations are configurable and will be confirmed with viaSport (TBD).

### Success Verification

Migration success is verified through reconciliation:

| Check                 | Method                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Row counts            | Source count matches target count                 |
| Checksums             | Hash comparison of key fields                     |
| Spot checks           | Manual verification of sample records by viaSport |
| Referential integrity | Foreign keys validated                            |

## Data Quality Targets and Defect Workflow

| Metric                 | Target                           |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Successful import rate | 99%+ of records                  |
| Validation pass rate   | 95%+ on first attempt            |
| Duplicate detection    | 100% of exact duplicates flagged |
| Referential integrity  | 100% of relationships valid      |

Defects are classified by severity and resolved before moving to the next migration phase.

## Technical Infrastructure

### Import Processing

Large imports run in two lanes:

- **Interactive lane:** Validation and import for smaller files inside the app.
- **Batch lane:** ECS Fargate worker for large files in perf and prod; local fallback available in dev.

### Checkpointing and Errors

- Checkpointed processing allows resumable jobs.
- Row-level errors are captured and can be reviewed or re-imported.

## Dependencies on viaSport

Migration execution requires:

1. Legacy system access (export capability or direct database access)
2. Schema documentation for BCAR and BCSI
3. Data dictionary and field mapping approval
4. SME availability for validation and sign-off

Import tooling is ready today. Extraction approach will be finalized during Discovery based on legacy system capabilities. See **System Requirements Compliance Crosswalk** (DM-AGG-006) for detailed compliance mapping.

## Cutover and Change Management

A successful migration includes technical data movement and a managed transition for viaSport staff and PSOs.

### Cutover Approach (Recommended)

| Step                  | Description                                                 | Outcome                                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Pilot org migration   | Migrate one PSO end-to-end, validate workflow and reporting | Validated templates, mappings, and training approach |
| Migration waves       | Migrate remaining orgs in planned cohorts                   | Manageable support load, reduced risk                |
| Data freeze window    | Short read-only or limited update window on legacy systems  | Prevents last-minute divergence                      |
| Final delta migration | Import changes since last full migration                    | Production data is current                           |
| Go-live               | Solstice becomes system of record, support team on standby  | Controlled launch                                    |
| Hypercare             | Elevated support and daily check-ins for a defined period   | Fast issue resolution, adoption support              |
| Rollback plan         | Predefined rollback criteria and steps                      | Risk control if a blocking issue occurs              |

### Sector Communication and Training

- Publish a cutover calendar (freeze window, go-live date, support contacts).
- Provide role-based quick-start guides and live training sessions.
- Use a ticketing workflow and escalation path during hypercare.

### Downtime and Continuity Expectations

- Document expected downtime (if any) during final cutover.
- If parallel run is required, define duration and responsibilities (who submits where, what is source of truth).

| KMS               | Encryption key management                  |

### Why AWS

| Factor           | Rationale                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Canadian region  | Data residency compliance      |
| Serverless-first | Reduced operational burden     |
| Mature services  | Strong SLAs and documentation  |
| SST integration  | Infrastructure as code for AWS |

### Why Serverless

Serverless provides:

1. No server management or patching
2. Automatic scaling during peak reporting periods
3. Pay-per-use cost efficiency
4. High availability across availability zones

### Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure is defined in TypeScript using SST. This provides:

- Reproducible environments
- Version control for infrastructure changes
- Disaster recovery from code
- Environment parity across dev, perf, and prod

## Development and Customization Process

### Environment Strategy

| Environment | Purpose                 | Infrastructure Tier                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| sin-dev     | Development and testing | t4g.micro, 50 GB, single-AZ                             |
| sin-perf    | Performance testing     | t4g.large, 200 GB, single-AZ, CloudTrail with alarms    |
| sin-uat     | User Acceptance Testing | t4g.medium, 100 GB, single-AZ, CloudTrail with alarms   |
| sin-prod    | Production              | t4g.large, 200 GB, Multi-AZ, 35-day backups, CloudTrail |

Each environment is isolated with its own database, storage, and credentials.
The sin-uat environment is available for viaSport evaluator access, while
performance testing is executed in sin-perf.

### Development Workflow

```
Developer writes code
        |
        v
Pre-commit checks (lint, type check, format)
        |
        v
Automated tests
        |
        v
Code review and merge
        |
        v
Deploy to sin-dev (automatic)
        |
        v
Deploy to sin-perf (manual, for load testing)
        |
        v
Deploy to sin-prod (manual, after UAT sign-off)
```

### Quality Gates

| Gate          | Tooling           | Purpose                        |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Linting       | oxlint and ESLint | Code quality                   |
| Type checking | TypeScript        | Compile-time validation        |
| Formatting    | oxfmt             | Consistent style               |
| Unit tests    | Vitest            | Component and function testing |
| E2E tests     | Playwright        | Full user flow testing         |

### Deployment Process

Deployments are executed with SST:

```
npx sst deploy --stage sin-prod
```

This builds the application, deploys infrastructure, and updates application services. Database schema changes are applied through versioned migrations when required.

### Rollback

- Previous Lambda versions remain available for quick rollback.
- Database migrations include rollback plans when needed.
- SST maintains deployment history for audit and recovery.

### Customization Capabilities

The platform supports configuration without code changes:

| Customization         | Method                                        |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Branding              | Tenant configuration (logo, colors, name)     |
| Forms                 | Form builder UI for custom data collection    |
| Roles and permissions | Admin UI for role management                  |
| Notifications         | Configurable templates and reminder schedules |
| Retention policies    | Admin-configurable retention periods          |

### Change Management

Changes to production follow a defined process:

1. Change request submitted
2. Impact assessment (scope, risk, timeline)
3. Development and testing in sin-dev
4. Performance validation in sin-perf
5. UAT sign-off
6. Deployment to sin-prod
7. Post-deployment verification

Emergency changes follow an expedited process with retrospective documentation.

### Automated Testing

Automated tests run in CI and gate merges where applicable. Coverage focuses on
core workflows: login, data submission, reporting, analytics, and access
control. There is also automated security testing, please see below for further
details.

### Performance Testing

Performance testing is conducted in sin-perf with production-scale data. Final validation runs will be executed before submission (TBD).

| Metric              | Value             | Target           | Status   |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| Data volume         | 20.1 million rows | Production scale | Achieved |
| p95 latency         | 250ms             | <500ms           | Pass     |
| p50 latency         | 130ms             | N/A              | Pass     |
| Concurrent users    | 15                | N/A              | Pass     |
| Server errors (5xx) | 0                 | 0                | Pass     |

Evidence is summarized in Section 1.3 (final run TBD).

### Core Web Vitals

Lighthouse results from the prototype are recorded as noted in Section 1.3.
Final Lighthouse runs will be completed before submission (TBD).

### Security Testing

Security vulnerability scanning runs on every commit to identify issues early
followed by scheduled and pre-release scans to identify run-time issues.

Security testing covers authentication, authorization, and audit integrity, plus application vulnerability testing.

**Automated security checks**

- SAST and dependency scanning run in CI on each change to identify common vulnerabilities early.
- DAST runs against a staging environment on a schedule and again prior to major releases.

**OWASP Top 10:2025 coverage**

Our security testing program maps to the OWASP Top 10 categories. The full
mapping is provided in **Appendix J: OWASP Top 10:2025 Mapping**.

**Operational monitoring**

In production, application-level detection is combined with AWS monitoring and logging (CloudWatch/CloudTrail) to support detection, alerting, and incident response. High-severity security events (account lockouts, anomaly flags) emit CloudWatch metrics for alerting.

**Functional security testing validates:**

- MFA and password recovery
- Session expiry and step-up authentication
- Role-based access enforcement
- Audit log integrity and hash chain verification
- Account lockout and anomaly detection

Security evidence is summarized in Section 1.2.

### Defect Management

| Severity | Definition                             | Response Time |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Critical | Security vulnerability, data loss risk | Immediate     |
| High     | Core functionality broken              | Same day      |
| Medium   | Non-critical functionality affected    | Within sprint |
| Low      | Cosmetic or minor UX issues            | Backlog       |

Defects are tracked in a shared system accessible to viaSport.

## User Acceptance Testing Strategy

### UAT Approach

User Acceptance Testing validates that the platform meets viaSport requirements from the user perspective.

| Element       | Approach                                         |

## DM-AGG-001: Data Collection and Submission

**Requirement:**

> The system shall enable customizable form building, support flexible data entry through variable formats (forms, file uploads), with capabilities for real-time submission tracking, editing, and historical data migration.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

> Users and System Admin can successfully submit, track, and edit data.

**How We Meet It:**

- Administrators build and publish custom forms without code changes.
- Submissions support file uploads and status tracking.
- Users can edit submissions and view version history.

**Built Today:**

- Form builder with 11 field types (text, number, email, phone, date, select, multiselect, checkbox, file, textarea, rich text).
- Submission statuses with history and audit entries.
- File uploads validated and stored in S3 with access controls.
- Import jobs link historical data to form submissions.

**Remaining Scope:**

- viaSport specific templates and field definitions (TBD).

**viaSport Dependencies:**

- Final form templates and data dictionary.

**Approach:**
Template and field definitions will be finalized during Discovery. See **Service Approach: Data Submission and Reporting Web Portal** for UX approach.

**Evidence:**
Evidence is summarized in Section 1.3.

## DM-AGG-002: Data Processing and Integration

**Requirement:**

> The system shall enable standardization of data formatting, logging of transformation processes, and integration with external platforms through API (optional), and data import/export mechanisms.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

> Incoming data is processed uniformly, logged for traceability, and exchanged with external platforms.

**How We Meet It:**

- Import and export pipelines normalize data types and validate required fields.
- Transformation and import events are logged in the audit trail.
- Export formats support CSV, Excel, and JSON.

**Built Today:**

- Import parser with typed validation and row level error logging.
- Mapping templates and audit logging for import jobs.
- Export controls enforced through BI and reporting pipelines.

**Remaining Scope:**

- External API integrations scoped with viaSport and legacy system owners.
- Standardized mapping rules for cross system integrations.

**viaSport Dependencies:**

- Integration targets, API access, and data exchange requirements.

**Approach:**
Define integration scope during Discovery, then implement connectors and validation. See **Service Approach: Data Migration** for methodology.

**Evidence:**
Evidence is summarized in Section 1.3.

## DM-AGG-003: Data Governance and Access Control

**Requirement:**

> The system shall enforce role-based access to data and provide administrators with secure database access, along with data cataloging and indexing capabilities for discoverability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

> Users can only access data based on permission.

**How We Meet It:**

- Role-based access control with organization scoping is enforced on every query.
- Field-level access control is applied in analytics and exports.
- Data catalog indexes forms, templates, and reports for discoverability.

**Built Today:**

- Predefined roles (owner, admin, reporter, viewer) with permission checks.
- Data catalog and global search for forms, templates, and reports.
- Admin access to data through audited BI and SQL workbench.

### Data Catalog (What It Is)

In Solstice, the Data Catalog is a searchable inventory of forms, fields, templates, reports, and saved analytics views, with permission-aware access. It helps users discover what data exists and where it is used. It is not a document management system. Uploaded files are stored in S3 and referenced from submissions and catalog entries through secure links and access controls.

During discovery, we will confirm the proportion of structured submission data versus document-centric reporting and adjust catalog tagging and search priorities accordingly.

**Remaining Scope:**

- Catalog taxonomy and tagging refinement with viaSport (TBD).

**viaSport Dependencies:**

### AI Enablement Foundation (Built)

The platform includes a production-ready AI foundation layer that enables rapid delivery of AI features during the engagement. This infrastructure is fully implemented:

| Component                    | Description                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AWS Bedrock integration      | Claude, Amazon Nova, and Cohere models via Bedrock in ca-central-1      |
| Central AI service           | Unified interface with retries, timeouts, and error handling            |
| Prompt template registry     | Versioned prompts with audit trail and rollback capability              |
| Structured output validation | Zod schema validation ensuring AI responses match expected formats      |
| Usage logging and costs      | Per-request tracking of tokens, latency, cost estimates by org and user |
| Quota enforcement            | Rate limiting and budget controls per tenant and user                   |
| Embedding support            | Cohere and Amazon Titan embeddings for semantic search                  |

AI features use AWS Bedrock with models hosted exclusively in ca-central-1. No AI provider outside Canada will be used without explicit written authorization from viaSport.

### AI Feature Candidates

The following AI features are included in the contract scope. During Planning, we will conduct UX research with viaSport staff and PSO representatives to determine which features deliver the highest value and should be prioritized for implementation.

| Feature                  | Description                                                                                   | Target Users         | Value                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| AI report narratives     | Generate natural language summaries from analytics dashboards for board reports and briefings | viaSport admins      | Reduce manual report writing by 60-80%  |
| Natural language query   | Ask questions in plain English and receive structured answers from the data warehouse         | viaSport admins, PSO | Self-service analytics without SQL      |
| AI dashboard builder     | Describe a visualization in words and generate chart configurations automatically             | viaSport admins      | Faster dashboard creation               |
| Semantic document search | Search submissions and documents by meaning rather than exact keywords                        | All users            | Find relevant records faster            |
| Data quality AI          | Detect anomalies and outliers in submissions with plain-language explanations                 | viaSport admins      | Catch errors before they affect reports |
| Submission assistant     | Contextual guidance and suggestions while completing forms based on historical patterns       | PSO staff            | Reduce submission errors and rework     |

### Prioritization Approach

AI features will not be enabled without user research. Our approach:

1. **Discovery interviews** with viaSport staff and PSO representatives to understand pain points
2. **Value mapping** to identify which features address the highest-impact workflows
3. **Prototype testing** of prioritized features with real users before production release
4. **Iterative rollout** starting with the highest-value feature, gathering feedback before expanding

The foundation work is complete. We will implement the AI features that drive real value for viaSport and PSOs based on what we learn during research.

## Responsible AI Approach

| Principle                | Implementation                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transparency             | All AI-generated content is clearly labeled; users see when AI assisted                   |
| Human-in-the-loop        | AI outputs require human review before publishing or external sharing                     |
| Privacy by design        | No PII in prompts; data aggregated or anonymized before AI processing                     |
| No unauthorized training | viaSport data is never used for model training without explicit consent                   |
| Bias mitigation          | Regular review of AI outputs for demographic or organizational bias                       |
| Audit trail              | All AI requests logged with prompt version, user, timestamp, and response characteristics |
| Data residency           | AWS Bedrock in ca-central-1 only; no non-Canadian AI providers without written consent    |

## Optional Add-Ons

### Third-Party Penetration Testing

**Estimated:** $10,000 to $20,000 per assessment

Independent penetration testing by a qualified third-party security firm. Can be scheduled pre-go-live or annually. Austin Wallace Tech coordinates with the testing firm and remediates findings.

### Extended Support Coverage (24/7)

**Estimated:** $30,000 to $50,000 per year additional

Adds after-hours monitoring and response outside business hours, with Sev 1 response time reduced to 2 hours.

### Operations Portal (Events and Team Management)

**Estimated:** $50,000 to $100,000 implementation, plus ongoing support

The Solstice platform includes an operations portal used by Quadball Canada. This could be extended to viaSport and PSOs to unify reporting and operations.

## Pricing Philosophy

Pricing is based on the value delivered, not on hourly billing. The existing prototype represents Austin Wallace Tech's investment in building a platform for the sport sector. viaSport benefits from:

- A working system available for evaluation before contract award
- Reduced delivery risk (23 of 25 requirements already built)
- Principal-led delivery with no organizational layers
- A managed service model with clear service levels and included enhancement capacity

The prototype and principal-led delivery model reduce overhead and accelerate implementation compared to traditional project structures or enterprise platform integrations.

## Appendix D: Security Architecture Summary

### Shared Responsibility Model

The security model follows the AWS shared responsibility approach: AWS secures the underlying cloud infrastructure, and we implement and operate the application controls, configuration, and monitoring required for viaSport's use case. AWS compliance reports (SOC, ISO) are available via AWS Artifact upon request.

### Data Residency

Primary data stores (RDS PostgreSQL, S3 object storage, backups, and audit archives) are hosted in AWS Canada (Central) (ca-central-1). Authenticated content is configured to avoid edge caching. Email notifications are delivered to recipients and may traverse external networks.

### Encryption

| Scope              | Standard                                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| In Transit         | TLS 1.2+                                       |
| At Rest (Database) | AES-256 via AWS KMS                            |
| At Rest (Storage)  | AES-256 via AWS KMS                            |
| Secrets            | AWS Secrets Manager (SST-managed, deploy-time) |

## Appendix J: OWASP Top 10:2025 Mapping

Our security testing program maps to the OWASP Top 10 categories:

- **A01: Broken Access Control** - Attackers bypassing authorization to access
  other users' data (critical for SEC-AGG-001).
- **A02: Security Misconfiguration** - Unsecured S3 buckets, default passwords,
  or overly permissive cloud settings.
- **A03: Software Supply Chain Failures** - Vulnerabilities in third-party
  libraries or compromised build pipeline.
- **A04: Cryptographic Failures** - Weak encryption or plain-text data storage
  (directly impacts PIPEDA compliance).
- **A05: Injection** - SQL, NoSQL, or command injection.
- **A06: Insecure Design** - Architectural flaws that cannot be fixed by
  coding.
- **A07: Authentication Failures** - Weak MFA, credential stuffing, or session
  hijacking (directly impacts SEC-AGG-001).
- **A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures** - Tampering with updates or
  data without verification.
- **A09: Security Logging and Alerting Failures** - Lack of real-time
  monitoring (directly impacts SEC-AGG-002 and SEC-AGG-004).
- **A10: Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions** - Error messages that leak
  sensitive info or systems that fail open.
