I have combined all the final.md's in '/Users/austin/dev/solstice/docs/sin-rfp/response' into one '/Users/austin/dev/solstice/docs/sin-rfp/response/full-proposal-response.md' and the
appendices here '/Users/austin/dev/solstice/docs/sin-rfp/response/full-proposal-response-appendices.md'. I then put the full doc into a google doc, and that got 19 comments. Can
you'/Users/austin/Downloads/DraftRFP.html' gather the comments from the html, confirm you can see what text they are referring to, and then create a /response/doc-comments.md that maps
them to the section and the part of the text in that section's final.md that they are commenting on. If you get stuck, or any part of this is not possible, please stop and tell me.
The files may be too large for you to hold all into context at once; you will be unable to directly read the html due to it's size.
I included a screenshot from me opening it in the browser; file:///Users/austin/Downloads/DraftRFP.html#cmnt_ref14 is a direct link from clicking on one of the comments.
